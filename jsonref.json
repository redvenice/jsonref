[{"url":null,"title":"Almost countries Britons want head LOWER coronavirus infection rates","story":"Share this article   Mr Hancock said the number of new admissions for Covid-19 in England has fallen to the lowest since March 20, and demonstrates progress against the disease. Daily admissions are down seven per cent since last Tuesday.  The Department of Health revealed 324 more people had died across all settings. Each nation\u0027s health agency reported their own figures earlier today - including 12 in Scotland, seven in Wales and two in Northern Ireland. These figures do not always match with the DH count because of a difference in how they are recorded.Today\u0027s official Government figure, which brings the total closer to 40,000, is 68 per cent lower than the Tuesday a fortnight ago, when 545 deaths were recorded following a lag in reporting over the bank holiday. Processes for recording people\u0027s deaths are known for slowing down and even stopping at the weekends and on bank holidays, meaning there is a dip every Monday, followed by surges on Tuesdays.   The weekly report from ONS said there were 12,288 deaths registered in England and Wales in the week ending May 22, known as \u0027Week 21\u0027.This was 2,285 less than the previous week - but still 2,348 more than usual for this time of year.Professor Heneghan, director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, University of Oxford said he expects deaths to be back to normal by next week. Asked during a Science Media Centre briefing whether he expects deaths from Covid-19 to stop or plateau, Professor Heneghan said: \u0027If the trends continue, the deaths look like they will be back to where they should be normally by next week.\u0027There\u0027s been a continued reduction in hospital deaths, care home outbreaks are coming down so the \u0027all deaths\u0027 by (week) 22 I\u0027m expecting will be back to where we should be.\u0027Professor Heneghan said there may be no Covid-19 deaths by the end of June - which would follow Spain yesterday. Italy is still reporting between 50 and 100 deaths per day, and France around 30.\u0027But it also depends on what happens next, within sporadic outbreaks,\u0027 Professor Heneghan said.He warned that there will be spikes in deaths with further outbreaks in care homes, and said information on how many people are catching the virus in hospital would \u0027give us a really good understanding of the spreading of this disease\u0027.Professor Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at The Open University, said: \u0027I certainly don\u0027t want to be a prophet of gloom, but I would urge some caution about these positive trends. \u0027The new week\u0027s data would not yet have been affected by the loosening of the lockdown. That began to happen in the previous week (ending 15 May), though most changes occurred much more recently.\u0027If any of the changes turn out to have increased infections, that won\u0027t show up in death statistics yet anyway, because obviously there is a time gap between infection and death. But we\u0027ll see eventually.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"University students live course bubbles hold virtual freshers weeks","story":"Share this articleUniversities redesign campuses for social distancing and put students in protective \u0027bubbles\u0027 to deal with \u0027biggest crisis ever\u0027 | inews"},{"url":null,"title":"Brewers stock record amounts beer pubs reopen weeks","story":"Share this articleBreweries WILL deliver 250 million pints to pubs for June 15 - fuelling hopes they could reopen by the end of the month"},{"url":null,"title":"More Britons work home return office time","story":"Share this article The survey suggested that 14million are snacking routinely, while 10million have increased the amount of unhealthy food they eat.

Here, he tells Sophie Goddard how he’s keeping not only his pub afloat, but is helping out the people – and animals – around him, too ...For thousands of small business owners, the global pandemic has flung their futures – and those of their staff – into uncertainty. That’s certainly true for Graham Blaikie, and his pub the Mercat Grill in Whitecraig, Scotland. “I’d been watching the news about Covid-19 since December and luckily we’d prepared,” he explains. “Even before we closed, we had contactless hand sanitisers and I was always wiping down handles and menus. I’d also removed items from tables, so there weren’t as many touch points.” But when Boris Johnson’s March announcement saw pubs and restaurants close to the public, the business that had taken Blaikie nine years to build was suddenly forced to adapt for survival.The first step was ensuring customers could still enjoy the food they loved. “Prior to the shutdown, we’d been talking about what our strategy would be – I bought containers and had our takeaway menu prepped, so we were ahead of the game”, he says of being ready for business the next day. “We had a lot of fresh food in the pub, so on the Saturday we started the takeaway system.” But it wasn’t without its problems. “It’s not as easy as you think doing takeaway food, especially restaurant-style. When people order with us they’re having haggis cigars, patties, fish and chips, pepper beef with rice and my mum’s desserts ... that’s six different containers at least. We spent about £2,000 on takeaway boxes initially, that’s a lot of money. But it’s hopefully keeping us going.”With the government support package now in place – and extended until October – Blaikie has turned his attention to helping local people. Launching his Soup(er) Hero campaign in April, he is now making soup and sandwiches for those in need. With help from the community council, a community hub – where food is dropped off and distributed by local volunteers – was born. The feedback keeps him going. “There’s an older couple and the wife’s got cancer and every day they get their soup and sandwich,” he says. “They have the soup at 12 o’clock, then the man drives his wife to the hospital for her treatment and when they come back, they enjoy the sandwich. That’s what makes it worthwhile.”It’s not just people benefiting, either – residents of Edinburgh zoo are also tucking into the pub’s surplus wares. “I had a massive box of bananas left over and my mum said: ‘You should take this to the zoo.’ So I got hold of all my leftover fruit and knocked on the zoo door – and that’s been it ever since.” Now Blaikie’s weekly deliveries of fruit, vegetables and fish help to feed the animals at a time when visitors – the zoo’s main form of income – have come to a standstill. “You’d probably choose not to eat some of the bananas, for example, because they don’t look as good, but they’re perfectly fine for the animals. When we’re making sandwiches, not everybody likes the heels of the bread either, so I freeze them and take them along – nothing’s getting wasted. And if I see something for a good price at the wholesalers – apples, cabbages, broccoli - I’ll pick that up, too. We need to keep zoos going, they’re all under a lot of pressure.”While it’s difficult to ascertain when exactly businesses such as Blaikie’s will open again, for now, he is focusing on adapting the way they work to ensure business is possible. “We have an isolated table in the front vestibule area, so people can come in and collect food safely, using contactless on the card machines for takeaways. We have separate areas for drivers to sit in too, so we’re doing everything we can.” And plans are already afoot for when pubs are finally allowed to reopen. “I’m looking at adding an area to the outside, so people can sit there the whole year round and I’m hoping to put in a little microbrewerydistillery, so I could eventually make hand sanitiser further down the line.”Why focus on helping others when keeping his own business afloat requires such effort? “I believe in helping people. I know this virus is a horrible thing, but it’s bringing out a lot of good in people as well. Neighbours are looking after neighbours, people are helping others with shopping or taking dogs for a walk. For so long, I didn’t like the way the world was going ...”What does Blaikie hope will come out of this situation? He pauses, then says: “That people start to work together a bit more, being more thoughtful of what’s going on around them. And of course, that they come to the Mercat for a meal.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

But thanks to safety measures put in place, a branch of David Abrahamovitch’s coffee chain is welcoming back happy customers and staffFor David Abrahamovitch, founder of cult coffee brand Grind, the decision to close his London-based food, coffee and cocktail bars was a painful one – and the decision to reopen one branch as a takeaway outlet on 20 May took even more careful planning.Abrahamovitch’s business journey started in 2011, when he inherited his father’s company. “I was 25 when I sadly lost my dad and inherited the family’s mobile phone business,” he says. “I had to decide what to do next – are we going to continue, are we going to close? I’d spent a lot of time in the shop as a teenager, helping out behind the counter, so it was very sentimental for me. I decided I wanted to keep the building and turn it into some kind of meeting place.”Converting the Old Street premises into a coffee shop, Abrahamovitch set about growing his business based on the cafes he’d visited on his travels. “I’d seen the independent cafe scene in other countries, and back then it just didn’t feel like it had been fully translated to the UK,” he says.“I wanted to recreate that Australian-style flat-white culture, with high-quality coffee beans, the best equipment, and amazing baristas who serve cups of coffee somewhere fun, lively and energetic. And I wanted to mix that with what the coffee chains do so well: good hygiene, mobile ordering and payment options and, most importantly, speedy service. A year later, we added cocktails when we realised our coffee made amazing espresso martinis!”Over the next nine years Abrahamovitch rolled his business out, spreading to 11 locations with 300 members of staff, serving sit-down breakfasts, lunch and dinner alongside coffee and cocktails. Grind also has an online business selling compostable coffee pods in refillable tins.When coronavirus reached the UK, Abrahamovitch’s business was sent into turmoil. “I’ve lived and bled this company for almost 10 years, and built it piece by piece, so finally getting to the point where we have tens of thousands of customers each week, then suddenly having to close was awful,” he says. “I remember the week of lockdown vividly. For a couple of weeks beforehand, we’d already seen sales start to fall away. We monitor sales to the hour, so when things start to drop off, you really notice it.“Then, when Boris Johnson told people they shouldn’t visit restaurants and bars, it was clear to us it was time to close. We shut all our stores, keeping just three open for takeaway to serve the local community for a few more days. When full lockdown was announced, we decided to close completely to protect our staff.”In the weeks since lockdown began, significantly more has been learned about the spread of Covid-19, and on 10 May the government announced certain businesses could reopen, with stringent safety rules in place. Guidance on how bosses can protect their workers, and how staff can safely travel into work, was drawn up. So now, companies such as Grind are taking tentative steps towards getting back to business, and on 20 May, its Greenwich outlet reopened its doors for grab-and-go coffees.Since plans to reopen were made, the safety of both staff and customers has been paramount. Grind works with a food hygiene company that has helped Abrahamovitch stay on top of the new government guidelines on safety and hygiene. “I think we’re all in a testing phase and figuring this out at the moment, but we’ve taken the steps we think are sensible without filling the place with yellow tape,” he says.“Only a couple of people are allowed inside the shop at any one time. Staff wear gloves, and at the tills there are big plastic screens separating them from customers – we haven’t made the wearing of masks mandatory, but they’re available if staff would like to use one.“We also have signs in the windows asking people to observe social distancing, stickers on the floor indicating what a two-metre gap looks like, and a hand sanitising station. It’s slightly odd having these things everywhere, but it seems to be working so far. I think people have got used to that kind of process in the last few weeks.”As well as coffee, the store is selling fresh bread, eggs and avocados, in lieu of breakfast. “We weren’t selling those things before, but we have great suppliers who make amazing bread and send us amazing eggs,” he says. “If we can help them and sell a few more products ourselves too, it makes sense. When you’ve suddenly got a daily bread delivery, it feels like you’re getting the wheels turning again.”Abrahamovitch took the inidual needs of his staff into careful consideration, making decisions based on the government’s advice, along with his own sense of duty to worried workers. On reopening Greenwich Grind, he took the simple step of asking which of his staff would be keen to return to work.“Everyone who wanted to be furloughed has been furloughed,” he says. “We haven’t laid anyone off as a result of this crisis, which helps me sleep better at night. Of those who volunteered to come back to Greenwich Grind, we selected those who live very close to the store, so there’s no need for them to get public transport into work. Lots of our staff walk or cycle in anyway, so if someone wants to come back, and lives close to a store we’re reopening, that’s a good fit.”Abrahamovitch hopes these measures will prove successful, and will lay the foundations for further, tentative reopenings. “We’re certainly expecting to learn a lot from this reopening,” he says. “At a lot of our sites, social distancing isn’t actually the biggest issue – for example, our London Bridge site relies on customers who work in the offices in the area, and the tourists who come to visit Borough Market at the weekend. Until they’re back, it’s going to be hard for us to reopen, but I hope to reopen one or two more branches in the next couple of weeks.”Abrahamovitch’s customers and staff are especially pleased by this step on the way to resuming business. “One of my staff texted me on the first day of reopening and said: ‘I’m so happy to be back and not just sitting in my living room. It’s been amazing.’ So that was pretty nice,” he says. “Our customers are thrilled, too – I was there the day before we opened, checking the safety measures for myself, and people were knocking on the door hoping to get inside early.“For me, as a customer, every time a place reopens I’m really happy. I think: ‘Great, I’ve got somewhere else to go, different people to meet, some different walls to look at.’ It’s definitely the same for our customers. They’re very pleased to have us back.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

It is a taster of a major exhibition on images of Dickens that the museum will stage as soon as it is able to reopen after lockdown restrictions are relaxed further.The show will include eight black and white images from the collection that have been colourised by the portrait and still life photographer Oliver Clyde. Newly revealed is an image of Dickens, aged 47 in 1859, the year he published A Tale of Two Cities.Frankie Kubicki, a curator at the museum, said the project was about bringing people closer to the real Dickens. Although the author’s face is well-known, said Kubicki, he “suffers from the austere nature of the technology of the time he lived.“It makes him very stiff. That is not at all what Dickens was like. He had a great sense of humour and was full of passionate energy. He absolutely loved fashion and loved quite colourful and daring clothing and of course all of that is lost in those images. That’s the power of colourising, it is putting some of that personality back.”Kubicki said Dickens was a great walker and loved being outside and there were descriptions of him having a healthy tan.The project has involved Clyde studying the complexion and skin tone of Dickens’ great-great grandsons, Gerald and Mark.Mark Dickens recalled a fun lockdown day with his 28-year-old son, Oliver, marshalling him into the different poses and taking photographs to send on to Clyde.“It was slightly disconcerting to see the results,” he said. “It is a bit weird isn’t it but it is rather special … I think the whole concept of the project is absolutely fascinating.“I’m sure we’ve all seen the world war one colourisation which just transformed people’s views of those soldiers. It brought them to life and that is exactly what is happening with this … it creates a character you can really identify with. It brings you much closer to him.”The image shows Dickens wearing a crisp white shirt, navy jacket, bow tie and tartan waistcoat. One area of contention is the colour of his eyes, with different descriptions of them being blue and green. After studying the original photographs Clyde believes they were darker and possibly brown.The biggest surprise for Clyde was the skin tone, bucking “the image of the pallid Victorian complexion by being tanned and healthy-looking”.He added: “Seeing Dickens in colour reveals so much. You can see photographs where he clearly hasn’t run a comb through his hair for days, where his beard is all over the place or where he’s sweating after being made to stand in a hot room for hours on end.”The photographs will be a finale to the exhibition Technicolour\u0026nbspDickens: The Living Image Of Charles\u0026nbspDickens, which explores how images of the author were consumed and circulated throughout his career and after his death. It was meant to be a highlight of the museum’s summer events and will open when the museum can open.Situated at 48 Doughty Street, Dickens’ London residence where he wrote books including Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, the museum is completely self-funding so has found its position “particularly challenging” because of the lockdown, said its director, Cindy Sughrue.The museum has set up an appeal on the crowdfunding site JustGiving. “I am extremely grateful for everyone who has already donated to our fundraising appeal but we’re not there yet,” Sughrue said. “We need £30,000 each month during closure to cover the basic costs of caring for Dickens’ house and the world-class collection it holds.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1adce50e117fdb733d3d8d9fcbd8fa6d8db7431/0_335_5735_3444/master/5735.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a53757633961fec052a21a685e00d246","title":"uk shops slash prices as coronavirus causes sales to plummet","story":"Deepest monthly price cuts for 15 years as desperate retailers try to encourage consumer spendingBritish retailers struggling during the coronavirus pandemic have cut their prices by the most in a month since 2006, according to industry figures revealing the scale of the economic fallout.Retail sales in the UK plunged in April at the fastest pace on record as tough controls on business and social activity forced people to stay at home, bringing the economy largely to a standstill.Consumer spending dropped by almost a fifth in April, according to the most recent government figures, as the coronavirus crisis wiped out 15 years of growth in two months. Some sectors experienced stronger sales, including food and alcohol retailers, as well as DIY shops and garden centres.As some non-essential shops begin to reopen this month as the British government loosens the lockdown, many retailers are expected to offer steep discounts to tempt consumers back to the high street. However, a splurge in consumer spending is not expected given the continued risk of infection from Covid-19 and because of the hit to household finances amid rising unemployment across the country.Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said: “Many retailers will have to fight to survive, especially with the added costs of social distancing measures.“Government support remains essential, both to rebuild consumer confidence and to support the thousands of firms and millions of jobs that rely on it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec0966aca9d9a6864275ddd8ec580696d29985b4/882_409_3962_2377/master/3962.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c88ae227f455eeebb8b36aa7009c2a6","title":"safe ease lockdown matt hancock alert system britain","story":"Right now, Britain is about as biosecure as the health secretary is convincing. But some people really want an Ikea side tableMeanwhile, and all of a sudden, the government has announced that some of the most vulnerable people in the country can go outside again. “Government eases lockdown for shielders”, was the big news. And it’s hard to think of a more reassuring headline for this particular group, coming from this particular government. Maybe “Government asks shielders to help them lift a sofa into the back of a van”. “Government waves from storm drain at shielders looking for their paper boats”. “Government responds to shielders saying ‘Dominic Cummings’ into a mirror three times”. “Government asks shielders to check in at a family-run motel”. “Government asks shielders to engage a 1980s Wall Street bro to take care of any household repairstree surgery they’ve been putting off during lockdown. Contractor will provide own nailgun and chainsaw.”I’ve no time for this theory that the government doesn’t care about having the worst death toll in Europe, based on the fact that they only robotically acknowledge it once a day by confirming how many people “have sadly died”. They do care, but just slightly shy of the amount required to tell a civil servant to visit\u0026nbspthesaurus. The repeat formulation gives the impression of being governed by a Grammarly template, or perhaps an automated phone system. “You are currently number –”\u0026nbsp“SADLY” “– in the queue.”On Sunday, it was Robert Jenrick’s turn on the sadface, with the housing and communities secretary released briefly for the press conference. He normally lives in a stock photo about online banking. Unfortunately, that environment seems not to have prepared Robert for questions about why the government is easing lockdown when they themselves said they would not do so until the official alert level was 3. “The alert level is changing,” Jenrick handwaved. “We are still at level 4 but we are transitioning to 3.” Is this like when I still haven’t done the ironing but I am transitioning to having done it? Have I, at that moment, done the ironing? No. Of course I haven’t. But I WILL have. Scientifically, it’s a hugely interesting space to be in. I call it participle physics – which is like particle physics, except Robert Jenrick can do it.The above may already be my favourite tense, even compared to the football continuous. “What he’s done there, is he’s thought he could come out of his house, but he’s got blindsided by that flailing threat level, he’s taken some virus right up the nose, and he’s sadly died. You don’t like to see that, do you?”Occupying a similarly liminal space is the new joint biosecurity centre, which is supposed to assess the alert level, and for which Matt Hancock raised his bullshit category to 5 on Monday. “We’re getting it stood up,” the health secretary blustered, as though it were an Ikea bookshelf, or a news story that 250,000 tests had been conducted, as long as you count cake tests, smoke alarm tests, pregnancy tests and online personality tests. “It’s being formulated,” Hancock went on of the biosecurity centre. “It’s being pulled together.” Sounds like it. Let us know if you need an Allen key. (Speaking of the ironing, these days my system is to do it during the 5pm Downing Street briefing. I find it helps to press down on something.)Staying with the good news, Priti Patel and Alok Sharma have reportedly been drafted in to “beef up” the virus war cabinet. So this brains trust now comprises Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, Hancock, Patel, Dominic Raab and Sharma. If you had to compare it to Harold Wilson’s kitchen cabinet, I guess you’d say it would be outperformed by the table. If they wanted to beef it up further they could buy 500g of mince. Or a gelatine sachet.Rumours of beef among the beefed-up have been debunked, however, with the Sunday Times scotching the idea that Raab had punched Cummings in a fight broken up by Gove.\u0026nbspIt may be politically incorrect to say so, but one does sometimes wonder if the male temperament is quite suited to roles in public life, what with their hormones. Sorry, hormone. For balance, and to bolster any snowflakes melting at that joke, I’d like to add the progressive view of Darren Grimes. Darren’s a Conservative and Brexit campaigner, and the third brother Jedward refuse to talk about. In April, he endorsed Dominic Raab’s view of Boris Johnson as a fighter. “Raab would know this,” he judged. “He’s a karate black belt that trained and fought so hard he had to have a hip replaced.”Moving on to middle-class etiquette black belt Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Commons leader has pushed for the full return of MPs to Westminster today and beyond. Having found the one place where he feels he fits in, Rees-Mogg is demanding it be reassembled the way he likes it, no matter the potentially deadly costs to disabled and vulnerable MPs or those they care for. He is assisted by the likes of Tory backbencher Christopher Chope, whose chief claim to fame is blocking a bill to criminalise upskirt photographs, apparently to make some philosophical point about something or other. What an out-and-out Cnut. On Monday, Chope could be found dismissing the 2-metre social distancing rules as mere “guidance”, and suggesting that MPs were some kind of exception to them. Can he not he just use a 2-metre selfie stick like any normal committed pervert?As for the ongoing deceit over the alert level, it has now emerged that chief medical officer Chris Whitty refused to lower it, and thus allow his science to be led by the government. But by now you’ll already be working on the principle that there’s one elite threat level, and another one for the rest of us. All-powerful strategist Dominic Cummings is currently operating on an alert level of minus 5, connoting that he denies the existence not simply of the virus, but of China itself, and has powers to make you lick the railings outside a primary school if you wonder if no-deal Brexit is still the genius idea it once was.Still, it’s great news that Boris Johnson hasn’t had to lose this Carnival Richelieu, this Otto von Jizzmark. I don’t want you to read anything into the fact that alongside Cummings, last week’s other highest-profile person to break the local lockdown rules was a 28-year-old Belgian princeling. This is sadly how we live now, no matter how wrong the public think it is. But sadly, you know? Definitely sadly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0b7f146029c297a188dd18c2e2f42961c42de9c/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6fbbc1b7bd2f2143b199175ed1dc690","title":"the guardian view on bame britain and covid 19 action not words required","story":"Public Health England’s findings on a disproportionate death toll among ethnic minorities must lead to a proper government responseThe publication of Public Health England’s report on the impact of Covid-19 on black, Asian and minority ethnic Britons gave us further confirmation of what has become increasingly obvious. Throughout the epidemic, as the faces of black and Asian doctors, nurses and transport workers have regularly appeared on the pages of newspapers and on our television screens, it has been clear that a disproportionate death toll is being exacted among Britain’s ethnic minorities.The PHE inquiry provides the statistics behind that impression: black and Asian ethnic groups, it found, were all significantly more likely to die with Covid-19 than those from a white British background. People from the Bangladeshi community face twice the risk of dying from Covid-19. One of the earliest tropes to be discarded during this crisis was the notion that the virus “did not discriminate”. In the wake of this report, it is now incumbent on the government to reflect and act on the evidence that it does – and to a large degree.We still do not know all the reasons for the disparities uncovered by the report, and it comes with caveats. Strangely, the study failed to take into account occupation, comorbidities or obesity levels. Other research has shown that this significantly reduces the difference in risks and outcomes between ethnic groups. A number of complex and interlocking factors are in play here. But over the past three months, there is no doubt that we have collectively witnessed a graphic real-time illustration of the potentially lethal impact of social inequality. BAME Britons, who are more likely to be lower-paid, live in poorer accommodation and be employed in public-facing jobs, are running the greatest risk during this crisis.On Tuesday the health secretary, Matt Hancock, denied that publication of the report had been held back because of sensitivities surrounding the death of George Floyd in America. But the timing inescapably foregrounds wider issues that require a proper response from the government. Hours before Mr Hancock spoke to MPs, the UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, issued a damning statement in which she said the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on ethnic minorities, in the US, the UK and elsewhere, shone a light on “alarming” levels of inequality that have been ignored for too long.Ms Bachelet called for urgent steps to be taken to prioritise monitoring and testing, and to give targeted information to minority communities. The Labour MP for Tottenham, David Lammy, has repeatedly called for similar action in Britain. New practical guidance is now urgently required, as the British Medical Association made clear in its response to the report.Public health is not merely a scientific affair to be left to epidemiologists and virologists it is undermined by the marginalisation, stress and poverty that often come with racial discrimination. Addressing this must be part of any post-pandemic social settlement, as the country draws appropriate lessons from a time that has exposed fault lines in a way which must not be forgotten. But more immediately, Mr Hancock must do more than tell the House of Commons, as he did on Tuesday, that “black lives matter”. He must act on those words."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de9c09459f07b72c1143987134b5f97f3fe0d100/0_170_3608_2165/master/3608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4900c6bfc4c8b333d0b67601f13f591","title":"blackout tuesday george floyd social media","story":"The black tiles posted online displaced other, more vital messages, a reminder that social media is not a force for changeOn Monday, Donald Trump threatened to deploy\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspmilitary\u0026nbspon domestic soil,\u0026nbspagainst his own people, and\u0026nbspordered the teargassing of peaceful protesters\u0026nbspnear\u0026nbspthe White House so that he could conduct a 17-minute photoshoot holding an upside-down\u0026nbspBible.At the same time, major cities including New York and Los Angeles declared curfews to stem the protests burning across the country since George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police. Police dressed in riot gear clubbed young, unarmed protesters. White militias swinging baseball bats\u0026nbspreportedly\u0026nbspprowled the streets of a Philadelphia suburb.\u0026nbspHundreds\u0026nbspof people\u0026nbspwere arrested between Atlanta, Las Vegas and Portland.All this to say that\u0026nbspit was\u0026nbspat this moment of shimmering state violence\u0026nbspthat members of the music industry decided to organize an\u0026nbspInstagram blackout, under the banner\u0026nbsp“#blackouttuesday”.\u0026nbspTo make\u0026nbspsure we knew who was behind the call, they added another hashtag – #theshowmustbepaused – and asked Instagram users to refrain from social media\u0026nbspactivity and post\u0026nbspa black square on their grids. Not only was this a facile attempt at armchair activism, it actively disrupted the hashtag #blacklivesmatter,\u0026nbspwhich protesters, reporters and activists were using to collate news about police violence against protesters. At exactly the moment when power requires interrogation and urgent reckoning, social media users, celebrities and influencers rallied for silence.No matter the occasion, social media can always be relied upon to gaze deep into its collective navel. Whereas 24 hours earlier, users had been posting legal information, names of pro bono lawyers and bail funds, filming videos of wanton cruelty and abuses of power, now they were shtum, save for the sanctimonious black squares.\u0026nbspThanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, many\u0026nbsppeople\u0026nbspcannot join protests, due to lockdowns or worries over infecting elderly friends and relatives. It’s understandable that there would be calls for online demonstrations of solidarity with our black brothers and sisters fighting for their lives, but\u0026nbspthe music industry might have chosen a\u0026nbspless useless\u0026nbspapproach.Instagram users, for example,\u0026nbspcould have been spurred to mass-post pages from a 2006 FBI internal intelligence memo – heavily redacted – that\u0026nbspdetailed the orchestrated infiltration\u0026nbspof police and law enforcement agencies by white supremacists. The memo noted white supremacists’ “historical” interest in law enforcement infiltration and warned that not only was there an “active presence” of white supremacists in police departments across the country but that many operated as “ghost skins” – neo-Nazis hiding their affiliations in order to “blend into society and covertly advance white supremacist causes”.Or social media users might have chosen instead to make viral (a parlance we will hopefully shake\u0026nbspafter this\u0026nbsppandemic) the fact that the Trump White House cancelled grants previously given to programs dedicated to reforming neo-Nazis and dissuading confused white youth from joining radical hate groups, such as Life After Hate. Or the fact that the Department of Homeland Security – whose very job is to identify internal dangers and threats – has shifted away from countering white far-right groups and terrorists since the Trump administration came to power.For all its distractions and entertainments, the inanity of #blackouttuesday has served as a vital reminder that social media is not a force for change. Instagram and Facebook, in particular, are echo chambers that consistently funnel our energy, righteous rage and political passions into inaction – into bland hashtags and likes.\u0026nbspSocial media\u0026nbspdents our critical perception and lulls us into, at best, the shallows of political engagement– and I say this as a longtime user of social media.\u0026nbspNot so long ago, #JeSuisCharlie became a rallying cry for social media warriors in the wake of the attack on Charlie Hebdo, a French satirical magazine. One can mourn the loss of life in a terrorist attack without identifying oneself with a magazine known for its racist depictions of Muslims, Jews and black people. But social media is not a place for nuance and less so for accountability. In this same way, Bollywood actors who have\u0026nbspshilled for skin-lightening\u0026nbspproducts\u0026nbsp– such as Priyanka Chopra, who advertised a cream called “Light Ultra” – can feel comfortable taking to their pages to bemoan racism. Gal Gadot, the actor who served in the Israel Defense Forces, can hashtag for George Floyd and earn\u0026nbsphundreds of thousands of\u0026nbsplikes.Social media\u0026nbsphas long been a silo of hypocrisy, but its thoughtlessness in the face of raging inequality, violence and fear grows with each new crisis. As for the promoters of #blackouttuesday, your silence, as Audre Lorde warned so many years ago, will not protect you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40c1758a150e07611f864fe81ccf69b0600c2ab3/0_363_5480_3290/master/5480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45ba20001c8083d4cff1fcbfa6bd9914","title":"britain democracy tories coronavirus public power","story":"If the Tories’ coronavirus fiasco shows us anything, it’s that the public don’t have as much power as we’re led to believeDo we live in a democracy? You may well ask. An unelected adviser seems to exercise more power than the prime minister, and appears unanswerable to people or parliament. Boris Johnson makes reckless public health decisions that could put thousands of lives at risk, apparently to dig himself out of a political hole. Parliament is truncated, as the government arbitrarily decides that MPs can no longer take part in votes remotely. As the government blunders from one disaster to the next, there seem to be no effective ways of holding it to account.Established power in this country is surrounded by a series of defensive rings. As soon as you begin to name them, you see that the UK is a democracy only in the weakest and shallowest sense.Let’s begin with political funding. Our system permits billionaires and corporations to outspend and outmuscle the electorate. The great majority of money for the Conservative party comes from a small number of very rich people. Just five hedge fund managers have given it £18m over the past 10 years. The secretive Leader’s Group grants big donors special access to the prime minister and his frontbenchers in return for their money. Courting and cultivating rich people to win elections corrupts our politics, replacing democracy with plutocracy.This grossly unfair system is supplemented by outright cheating, such as breaching spending limits and secretly funding mendacious online ads. The Electoral Commission, which is supposed to regulate the system, has deliberately been kept powerless. The maximum fine for winning an election (or a referendum) by fraud is £20,000 per offence. Democracy is cheap in this country.The structure and symbolism of parliament, with its preposterous rituals and incomprehensible procedures, could scarcely be better designed to alienate people, or to favour former public schoolboys, educated in a similar environment. Even its official emblem tells us we are shut out. It’s a portcullis: the means by which people are excluded from the fortress of power. The portcullis is topped by a crown, reminding us that power is still vested symbolically in an unelected head of state. Many of her actual powers have been assumed, in the absence of a codified constitution, by the prime minister.These powers are routinely abused, by all governments. Prime ministers bypass parliament, governing through special advisers like Dominic Cummings. When they make catastrophic mistakes, they have the power to decide whether or not there should be a public inquiry, and, if there should, what its terms and who its chair should be. It’s as if a defendant in a criminal trial were allowed to decide whether the trial goes ahead and, if so, what the charges should be and who the judge and jury are.Even when an investigation does take place, the prime minister can suppress its conclusions, as Johnson has done with the report on Russian interference in the British political system, which remains unpublished. Does it contain details of unlawful donations to the Conservative party? Or of Conservative Friends of Russia, whose launch party was attended by Cummings? A key figure in this group was a man who has subsequently come under suspicion of being a Russian spy. He has been photographed with Johnson, whom he described as a “good friend”. What was going on? Without parliament’s intelligence and security committee’s report, we can only guess.The same inordinate powers enabled Johnson to suspend parliament last autumn, until his decision was struck down by the supreme court, and to terminate remote access for MPs this week, preventing many of them from representing us. He is, in effect, a monarch with a five-year term and a council of advisers we call parliament.The House of Lords is a further defensive ring within this ring. Some of its seats are reserved for hereditary aristocrats. Some are reserved for bishops, making this the world’s only country, other than Iran, in which religious leaders have an automatic right to sit. The rest are grace and favour appointments, keeping power within existing circles. Many of them are granted to major political donors, reinforcing the power of money. In any other country, they would call it corruption.\u0026nbspDespite a vast array of new democratic techniques, pioneered in other countries, there has been a total failure to balance our supposedly representative system with participatory democracy. This failure grants the winning party a scarcely challenged power, on the grounds of presumed consent, to do as it pleases, for five years at a time. Even when public trust and consent collapse, as they have now done amid the coronavirus pandemic, there are no effective channels through which we can affect the decisions government makes.These formal rings of power are supported by further defences beyond government, such as the print media, most of which is owned by billionaires or multimillionaires living offshore, and the network of opaquely funded thinktanks, that formulate and test the policies later adopted by government. Their personnel circulate in and out of the prime minister’s office.Our political system has the outward appearance of democracy, but it is largely controlled by undemocratic forces. We find ourselves on the wrong side of the portcullis, watching helplessly as crucial decisions are taken about us, without us. If there’s one thing the coronavirus fiascos show, it’s the need for radical change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bf0bce9fa33a9516c2dede0ecaf9919914c189a/0_2_1195_717/master/1195.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa15542e83695fcfc0cb308340b1b9d8","title":"british political advertising regulated parties support","story":"Misleading campaigns risk undermining trust in elections – we need an effective system to oversee themThe current global health crisis is, rightly, front and centre of all current political, media and societal discourse.\u0026nbspBut rewind just a few months and you’ll recall the UK general election, which played out against a backdrop of fraught debate about truth in political campaigns.\u0026nbspWhy can political parties act with apparent impunity when making claims in ads and other election materials?\u0026nbspThose concerns haven’t gone away.\u0026nbspThe Electoral Commission recently warned that misleading campaign techniques risk undermining trust in elections.\u0026nbspThe clamour for claims in political advertising to be subject to independent regulation, just like ads by commercial and non-political organisations, has been loud.\u0026nbspSome argue the health of our democracy depends on campaigners being made to back up their electioneering claims why, they say, should ads for commercial products be held to greater account than ads that might move votes and win elections?\u0026nbspWe at the Advertising Standards Authority agree that claims in political advertising should be regulated.\u0026nbspBut while that’s straightforward in theory, it’s complex in practice.\u0026nbspBefore addressing the difficult question of how, an essential first step must be that nations’ political parties (and campaign groups, in the case of referendums) agree to be regulated.\u0026nbspOtherwise what authority would any regulatory body have to intervene?\u0026nbspOne of the strengths of the ASA system is the support and cooperation we receive from the overwhelming majority of UK companies, who abide by our decisions on responsible advertising.\u0026nbspAnd one of the reasons why our system withdrew entirely from regulating political ads in the 1990s was the absence of sufficient support from political parties and our concern about restraining freedom of speech around democratic elections without a clear mandate to do so.\u0026nbspAs well as legitimacy, an effective regulatory system must be properly funded, have a carefully defined scope and be independent.\u0026nbspFunding is crucial because of the likely high cost of swiftly regulating political advertising to take effective action before polling day.\u0026nbspUnless drastic interventions such as mandatory pre-vetting were in place, more complicated or contested claims would need careful investigation and judgment, even if they emerged near the end of an election or referendum campaign.\u0026nbspThe public would rightly feel short-changed if a significant ruling changed impressions only after the votes had been counted and the winner declared.\u0026nbspThat careful investigation and judgment would need to happen quickly, while respecting well-established principles of good regulation, including delivering proportionate, consistent, accountable, targeted and evidence-based decisions.\u0026nbspRegulators are not the same as fact-checking services.\u0026nbspThey are typically compelled to offer a reasonable right of response and are subject to judicial review if they get it wrong.\u0026nbspDelivering high-quality decisions speedily and diligently is expensive and difficult.The architects of a political advertising regulatory system would need to consider carefully its scope.\u0026nbspGiven the important and necessary protections free political expression enjoys, they would be wise to consider establishing a narrow remit, regulating only clearly misleading statements of fact, avoiding being drawn into anything resembling a statement of opinion or forecast of the future, however contestable.\u0026nbsp(Of course, one person’s statement of fact is another’s statement of opinion, so even distinguishing between those can be difficult.)\u0026nbspAnd they would be faced with the unenviable decision of whether also to narrow the remit solely to paid-for advertising, where media owners and platforms could more easily play a gatekeeper role.\u0026nbspThat might sacrifice comprehensiveness at the altar of expediency, but would the regulator really want to be drawn into – or be capable of – deciding what politicians can say on their Twitter feeds, websites or election leaflets?\u0026nbspFinally, if the parties and campaign groups did agree to independent regulation, they must not take it out on the regulator if it’s their advertising, rather than their opponent’s, that is banned.\u0026nbspThe danger of becoming a political football and the need for different skills\u0026nbspmight make it worthwhile to explore a more collaborative model: with input from media and advertising industries, experts on legal and data issues, and insight from political and constitutional\u0026nbspperspectives.\u0026nbspExperts from several appropriate regulators could take on the task, perhaps just for the duration of election or referendum campaigns – this would combine their expertise and share the reputational risk.\u0026nbspThere is no doubt that the above requirements are challenging.\u0026nbspThe ASA, as a non-statutory regulator funded primarily by advertisers, is not the right body to lead political advertising regulation, but we are ready to help: sharing our experience of regulating non-political ads and exploring how we might contribute to a more collaborative arrangement.But precisely because this issue goes to the heart of our democracy, it needs to be the political parties and campaign groups who take the all-important first step: agree to be held to the same standard of truthfulness that society expects from companies.\u0026nbsp• Guy Parker is

no deal brexit vote leavers coronavirus","story":"The Vote Leavers at the heart of government think the coronavirus crash will disguise the pain caused by a rupture with the EUMost of us who have followed Brexit closely believed coronavirus would soften the government’s stance in trade talks with Europe. The economic shock triggered by the pandemic, and the fact Whitehall is so overwhelmed managing it, made it more likely the government would extend the transition period, due to expire at the end of this year, or strike a deal. It turns out that the opposite is true. Rather than encouraging a more flexible and pragmatic approach, Covid-19 has instead reinforced the case for no deal at the very top of government.Perhaps the most important driver is the belief among ministers that the UK economy will be permanently reshaped by the crisis, as companies create new supply chains and reshore production to provide greater resilience in the future, not least in case of another pandemic. The government wants a free hand to facilitate this change, one that it believes would be constrained by the EU’s demand that the UK remain tied to its labour and environmental standards and state aid rules.On the other side of the same coin, there are growing fears in cabinet that maintaining close EU ties would lock the UK into the EU’s post-Covid-19 economic measures designed for its 27 member states, with little regard for the UK’s interests.\u0026nbspThis is nonsense, as the\u0026nbspEU’s rescue package unveiled last Wednesday assumes no UK financial contribution. But it is a powerful argument on the Eurosceptic backbenches and has scared many in cabinet.Another\u0026nbspargument popular with backbench Brexiteers, but now more prominent among ministers, is the belief that coronavirus presents the government with an opportunity to “bury” the\u0026nbsploss of growth from no trade deal under the cover of the much more dramatic drop in GDP caused by coronavirus.The politics of this are very juicy for the Vote Leave team in the driving seat in government. Not least because it is only really a no deal that fully delivers on their substantive “ergence” agenda, while any\u0026nbspversion of a deal with the EU, no matter how distant, will ultimately tie the UK into EU rules and regulations in some way, an idea they hate and are loath to accept.\u0026nbspNo deal also\u0026nbspfacilitates a trade deal with the US, and the symbolism of “Global Britain” is key for ministers – far more important than the limited economic benefit a UK-US trade pact would bring.Time is also running out. Despite three rounds of talks so far, no progress has been made and negotiators on both sides are downbeat about the likelihood of a breakthrough this week.\u0026nbspBig gaps remain – in the UK over whether and how far to align to EU standards, the role of the European court of justice and the EU’s demands to fish in UK waters. But\u0026nbspthe government won’t extend the transition period. Boris Johnson believes he would struggle to sell to voters the extra £10bn in financial contributions and further spell of EU control of UK laws that this would bring.A political intervention on both sides will therefore be needed to move beyond the current stage. There will likely be an opportunity next month, when Johnson meets the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, virtually, around the time of a long-planned EU leaders’ session in June to review progress.\u0026nbspBut the EU is unlikely to change its mandate and absent progress, ministers plan to make a judgment in September so they can give business clarity about the trading arrangements from 1 January. They may switch to assuming and preparing for no deal then.Finally, the survival of Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s closest adviser, despite allegations he broke the lockdown rules, also enhances the prospect of no deal. One reason why Brexiteer ministers and aides rallied behind him is that he sees it as his personal mission to prevent Johnson extending the transition period in June, and delivering a version of Brexit that lets the UK “take back control”. It would be wrong to underestimate his impact on the outcome of these negotiations.Of course, this could all be tactics and bluster. Johnson\u0026nbspand his cheerleaders on the backbenches have convinced themselves that such brinkmanship worked during the withdrawal agreement talks, so it is no real surprise they intend to repeat the trick now. Especially as they believe, wrongly, that coronavirus will make the EU more desperate to conclude a deal and buckle at the last moment. But Downing Street is right that December is the real deadline.Germany’s role will be key. I say this not as a naive Brit, believing that Angela Merkel will ride to Britain’s rescue, but as someone who has spent more than two decades studying and working on EU affairs. With Germany at the head of Europe’s rotating presidency, and Merkel in the final throes of her chancellorship, she will find it very hard to sign off on no deal. Of all of the EU’s member states, Germany has been the most focused on the longer-term, geopolitical risk of no deal, and the necessity for the UK and EU to maintain constructive ties.But even Merkel can’t and won’t save the UK from itself, and will not agree to a deal at any price.\u0026nbspIf the net effect of Covid-19 is that ministers see more benefit than cost from no deal, for now the dominant view in cabinet, then that will indeed be the outcome at the end of this year.• Mujtaba Rahman is the managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group, a political risk research and consulting firm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad2632bf740089a7cfe7421d35ea988dcf380930/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b34bcb0c1d8d115e766b740262ac5c7","title":"teachers and parents how do you feel about schools reopening","story":"We’d like to hear from people about the return to schools, whether to teach or take their children, from MondayPrimary schools will begin their phased reopening to all pupils on Monday after more than two months of general closures, prime minister Boris Johnson has announced.Schools are already open to vulnerable and key worker children, who will gradually be joined by their classmates – though many primary schools will not be open to all eligible pupils right away.We would like to hear from teachers and parents of children who are returning to school next week.How is your school preparing for children to return?

Experts have called for action to help retain the air quality benefits of lockdowns, and measures taken to date have included expanding cycle lanes and space for walking in cities.“The rapid rebound in air pollution and coal consumption levels across China is an early warning of what a smokestack industry-led rebound could look like,” said Crea’s lead analyst, Lauri Myllyvirta. “Highly polluting industries have been faster to recover from the crisis than the rest of the economy. It is essential for policymakers to prioritise clean energy.”The energy consultancy group Wood Mackenzie predicts China’s oil demand will recover to near normal levels in the second quarter of 2020.Distinguishing the pollution changes caused by the lockdowns and their subsequent relaxations from other factors, such as weather and chemical interaction of pollutants, is complex. Spring is the most polluted season in western Europe in normal years, owing to the start of the agriculture cycle which causes ammonia emissions that go on to form particles over cities. The Cams team is now working with the Barcelona Supercomputing Centre to untangle these factors and produce robust estimates of the coronavirus effect.\u0026nbspPeuch said what happens next to air quality in European cities remained to be seen. “We do not know how people’s behaviour will change, for example avoiding public transport and therefore relying more on their own cars, or continuing to work from home.”Air pollution has been linked to heart and lung damage and many other conditions including diabetes and damaged intelligence. It is likely to affect virtually every organ in the body.There is growing evidence linking exposure to dirty air to increased risk of death from Covid-19, prompting calls to keep air pollution low to help avoid the dangers of a second wave of infection.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3835d5fddabecf05bbfcc47d785498439973ea39/0_215_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82675b34941c484cac207997ff9864c1","title":"remembering cheetahs photography competition the winners","story":"Remembering Wildlife, the groundbreaking charity picture book series, has announced the 10 winners of its photography competition to appear in its forthcoming book, Remembering Cheetahs, which will help to protect the world’s most endangered big cat.

She wants someone to say to her: “Wow, you’re really gorgeous, I wish I was like you.”At middle school, when you’re at a very impressionable age and you’re figuring out what beauty means in society, what you see in the media really influences you. I think that is a reality for a lot of girls who are trying to figure out their style, but also trying to figure out how to be seen by others – it’s all about that validation.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36f2915838efd3e524f53babf3bf0fac1ff3d1e7/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca1da28a04cf390097628292c50c9561","title":"al dressco how picnic chic became the look of the summer","story":"Post stay-at-home tracksuit, meet-ups with friends in the great outdoors are best done in ditsy florals and gingham – signifying safe and wholesome funThere are green-as-grass colours and puffed cotton sleeves, like this dress from Zara. There are tiered al-fresco frocks with folksy embroidery, such as the dreamy lilac number from \u0026amp Other Stories, above. The women who spent last winter wearing modishly austere, Little Women-esque prairie-style long-sleeve, high-neck dresses with ankle boots to the office are now to be found in pale florals and ruffle-trimmed picture necklines.The picnic dress is the new tracksuit. If the tracksuit was the uniform of Stay at Home, the picnic dress is Have Fun (but Sensibly, and Outside.) This is what a picnic dress stands for. Polka dots and florals are upbeat, but civilised. Smocking and puffed sleeves are summery without being provocative. Even the many gatherings in my local park, which are picnics in the impromptu sense – silvery tins of gin and tonic from the Tesco Express over the road, 99 Flakes from the ice-cream van – feature women adorned with vintage florals and delicately gathered pintucks.The psychology of the picnic dress is fascinating. Is it OK to wear celebration frocks in a pandemic? Where does Keep Calm and Carry On end, and Marie Antoinette at the Petit Trianon begin? No one knows the answer to these questions, which is precisely why the picnic dress is emerging as the go-to summer look. The iconography of picnicking, with its teddy bears and wicker baskets, is wholesome fun rather than hedonistic abandon. If we can agree that it is acceptable – even desirable – to find joy and love and beauty where we can, in the midst of all this, then the picnic dress channels summery pleasures at an appropriate pitch. Broderie anglaise says, I am here with my friends and family, and not to swap bodily fluids with randoms. Gingham says, I will go home before it gets dark and I start bumping into each people.And picnic dressing is more practical than it looks, as we head into a time of daycations and staycations. The unseasonable heatwave of the past week has given us an easy ride into a summer in which it seems that what socialising we are able to do will mostly take place outdoors. Al-fresco dressing in the British summer means keeping warm as well as keeping cool, and a picnic aesthetic works in scenarios where your swimwear-and-beach-cover-up holiday wardrobe will not. A good picnic dress knows how to look summery without being skimpy, which is useful on days when it is a bit goosebumpy in the shade. A picnic dress can be fitted around the waist but it will be loose around the thighs, which is important because it means you can sprawl comfortably on a blanket rather than clamp your knees demurely as necessitated by sitting on the floor in a short skirt. Oh, and a picnic dress is always a dress, not a jumpsuit. If your al-fresco socialising is taking place anywhere other than your own garden, this is a time for a dress, not a jumpsuit.And picnic dressing isn’t just about the dress. Love Shack Fancy, an American brand with an irresistible Laura-Ashley-goes-to-LA sunny-boho vibe, is the escapist fantasy shopping label of the moment, not just for dresses but for gossamer-fine cardigans – the Folley, in a wool-mohair blend with vintage style rose buttons, comes in a perfect summer-sky blue. Shoes should be easy to slide off, for picnic blanket etiquette. The Loupe sandal by Dune \u0026nbspwill work as brilliantly on holiday, if you should ever get one, as it does in the park. This strangest of summers calls for uncomplicated clothes. Real life isn’t exactly a picnic right now. But your summer wardrobe can be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5c39ee2f6cc96ddef80e0104ae56a53e24aea33/0_86_2768_1661/master/2768.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee330446ad3deeab358e0afa81734c8e","title":"my favourite film aged 12 the sixth sense m night shyamalan","story":"M Night Shyamalan’s ghost story terrified me to my teenage core – and ignited a love for clever storytellingI turned 12 in 1999. Some film buffs like to say the year was one of the greatest in cinema’s history, spawning storied releases such as Fight Club, Eyes Wide Shut and Magnolia. As a pre-teen, most of these went over my head – I was just starting to dip my toe in the world of adult cinema. Like most of my peers, I had been illicitly smuggled into Titanic the previous year despite its 12 certificate. Buoyed by that experience, I had my sights trained on a 15 rating, so I took on The Sixth Sense, bracing myself for “moderate horror”.\u0026nbsp“Moderate horror” is probably a fair assessment given that there’s no depravity or gore in the film – it’s more about the psychological chills. But it still feels like understatement for a film that sparked a 20-year fear of the dark.\u0026nbspThe film is about a boy, played by Haley Joel Osment, who is able to see and talk to the dead. Bruce Willis, playing a child psychologist, tries to unravel the mystery. It culminates in an iconic plot twist, a genuine pop culture phenomenon.In a possible vindication of the certification system, the film was both hugely enjoyable and deeply perturbing. I began to obsess about the idea of faint ghostly outlines materialising in the shadowy corners of my bedroom, perhaps hovering above my hi-fi, or sitting peaceably on my feather-filled inflatable armchair. I’m not sure where this supernatural being would have come from in a house built in 1992 – an ancient burial ground beneath the foundations? A poltergeist on a mission to terrorise suburban tweens? Either way, a sighting felt like a matter of when, not if.\u0026nbspNaturally, this was always going to dovetail with an overactive imagination to culminate in a “ghostly experience”. It happened a fortnight after I returned from my first long-haul holiday, when I was lying awake at around 3am.\u0026nbspI heard strains of sinister choral music. Initially I dismissed it as coming from my parents’ bedroom TV – but it grew louder, sounded too creepy, and it was too late for that. Then the sounds suddenly stopped, and all the dogs in the neighbourhood started barking. Then my brother came into my room. It seemed a strange coincidence that he too would be awake in these early hours –\u0026nbsphe must also have sensed the supernatural presence.\u0026nbspAfter that point, my fear of ghosts grew to the point that I struggled to sleep without a light on (a source of private shame for any teen).\u0026nbspYears later, in a plot twist worthy of M Night Shyamalan himself, my parents mentioned how they’d struggled for weeks to recover from their post-Florida jetlag and had regularly stayed up watching TV till the early hours. Obviously, that’s why my brother was up too. I assume a cat had set the dogs off.Yet that dose of realism didn’t expunge my fear of the dark. I am a deeply rational person yet to this day, when I am in the bathroom and someone accidentally turns off the light, I’m immediately transported to the scene where Osment is trapped in a dark closet, ghosts looming into view. As my panic steadily rises, his iconic line comes into my head: “I see dead people …\u0026nbspwalking around …\u0026nbsplike reg-glar people.”All this might suggest that the film was a traumatic experience I now regret, but I don’t. My fear of the dark is more a cathartic way to experience a primal emotion –\u0026nbspterror – than something that holds me back. It fascinates me that stories can shape our emotions and experience as well as reflect them.I took other things from the film. Although its plot twist might seem a bit silly in retrospect, my 12-year-old mind was blown. I like to post-rationalise it as having instilled in me an appreciation for the power of clever storytelling. As a journalist, my favourite stories are those told from sideways angles or by making unexpected connections. And Shyamalan was such a phenomenon. It was inspiring to see a film-maker become a household name for their writing. There weren’t many others, bar perhaps Charlie Kaufman, whose Being John Malkovich (a film I would grow to love at a more appropriate age) came out the same year.\u0026nbspIt was Shyamalan, though, who had the biggest impact on my teen years. The biannual cycle of anticipation in the run-up to his latest film, and the inevitable crushing disappointment when it turned out to not be as good as The Sixth Sense: it’s my most enduring memory of early noughties cinema-going.Yet despite feeling at the time like I was a privileged witness to a seminal piece of cinematic history, I’ve never summoned the courage to rewatch The Sixth Sense. But during lockdown I’ve got a lot of extra time on my hands. I just hope my boyfriend is ready to start sleeping with the lights on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ea16b3d4f5b8aab31f0ef8d3eb5178c87fff343/30_59_2497_1498/master/2497.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca265f63c8471a460b4d3417b196ada2","title":"which football team has been the quickest to take a 2 0 lead","story":"Plus: goal-averse well-capped international forwards, almost perfect mid-table mediocrity and professional grandparentsMail us your questions or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU“What is the shortest time it’s taken a team to get a two-goal lead from the start of a game?” writes Paul Landsberg. “Has anyone managed to get 2-0 up by the second minute?”“Yes they have,” yelps Robin Tucker. “England’s Women beat Turkey 8-0 in 2013. Not only did they go 2-0 up in the second minute, but\u0026nbspToni Duggan got both goals too. You can read all about it here.”And here’s Glynn Marshall, using the Knowledge as an excuse to score points over a local rival. “As a Leicester City fan, I am delighted to be able to point Paul towards our game against Derby at Pride Park in 1999. Muzzy Izzet added to Emile Heskey’s first-minute opener in …\u0026nbspthe second minute. How we laughed. Another from Heskey in the eighth, and a fourth from Ian Marshall on the quarter hour, had us consulting the record books. However the rout was completed with 75 minutes to play, so we had to make do with 4-0. I am equally delighted to point out that this was played in the prime-time Sunday TV slot, so I daresay it didn’t go unnoticed outside the east Midlands.” It remains the quickest any Premier League club has taken a 4-0 lead.“Unfortunately I clearly remember my team, PSV, going 3-0 down to St Etienne in 1979 after five minutes,” sighs Willem Verhagen. “It was not 2-0 after two minutes but equally distressing.”We think we may have found the quickest team out of the blocks to take a 2-0 lead, however. “On Wednesday 9 April 2008, Newcastle Blue Star scored two goals in the first 47 seconds of their 3–0 win over Bamber Bridge,” writes Martyn Amos. Blue Star’s club secretary, Jim Anderson told the BBC: “It’s caused a lot of interest. We’re just waiting for confirmation from the FA and the Guinness Book of Records. It took place in the Unibond First Division North which is a nationally recognised competition.”The FA said there was no category for such a record so, 12 years after the feat, Blue Star fans will have to take pride in the acclaim of being mentioned in this Knowledge segment instead.“I stumbled upon Mbo Mpenza’s Wikipedia page and despite a consistent scoring record at club level, he only scored three times for Belgium in 56 games. Has any striker got a worse record after playing 50 games or more?” asks Rob Davies.“Look no further than Europe‘s weakest teams, some of whom hardly ever score a goal in games,” writes Ásgeir H Ingólfsson. “San Marino’s current strikeforce includes Matteo Vitaioli (one goal in 58 games) and Danilo Rinaldi (one in 40). In fact, only one Sammarinese footballer has scored more than two goals for the national team (Andy Selva, with eight). Andorra’s Juli Sánchez has scored a single goal in 73 games, while André Schembre has three in 94 for Malta and Nicolas Hassler has three in 67 for Liechtenstein. If you narrow it down to teams who actually qualify for finals, Iceland‘s Jon Dadi\u0026nbspBödvarsson is approaching Mpenza’s achievements, with three goals in 48.” Let’s see if he keeps that run going.“On the last day of the 1993-94 season, I watched Buckingham Town draw 0-0 at Tonbridge, to finish our campaign with a record of P42 W14 D14 L14\u0026nbspF43\u0026nbspA42 Pts 56,” writes Philip Cornwall. “If it had still been two points for a win we would have had 42 points. Buckingham already had 43 goals so the perfect mid-table season of 42-14-14-14-42-42 was beyond us at kick-off. But has anyone actually achieved it?”Alas, we could not find an example of a team achieving perfect mid-table mediocrity, but Andy Grace has written in with another mighty close contender. “In the 1922-23 season, Southampton finished 11th in their first season in the old Division Two\u0026nbspwith a record of P42 W14 D14 L14 F40 A40 Pts 42.\u0026nbspI’d be surprised if you find anyone closer to the ‘perfect’ mediocre season than that.”“Does the Knowledge know of any players who became grandfathers while still active in the game?” asked Michael in November 2014.The Knowledge was aware of a few confirmed candidates for the grandparent club. Well, more specifically some of the Knowledge’s readership were. “Arnor Gudjohnsen (father of Eidur) fits the bill,” noted Malcolm Warburton. “He retired in 2001, Eidur’s eldest son (Sveinn Aron – then playing in the Icelandic League) was born in 1998.”Claudio Kristeller wrote: “The 1994 World Cup champion Raí became a grandfather in January 1999, at the age of 33. He would go on playing of the Brazilian first ision for another year and a half.” And … “If I’m not mistaken,” Chris Willis began, tentatively, “former Gillingham (and everyone else) goalkeeper Simon Royce became a grandfather while playing for Gillingham. Or it could just be terrace talk.”Update: since then there has been the story of Eez Eldin Bahder, the 75-year-old grandfather of six, who scored on his debut in the Egyptian third ision. It was an obvious – and successful – attempt to get a bit of publicity, mind.“My hometown club, Southend United, used to play a very large number of home games on a Friday night. The reason, I was told, is that attendance really suffered on Saturdays when West Ham (an hour’s train to Upton Park, back in the day) were also playing at home. This got me wondering, which team in the top four isions of English football has played most games on a Friday night?” asks Dean Collins.“Who was the first player (excluding the Home Nations) to receive a cap for his country while playing in the Football League?” wonders\u0026nbspMukhtar Khan.Send your questions and answers to\u0026nbspknowledge@the\u0026nbspor tweet\u0026nbsp@TheKnowledge_GU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ece7d4aab49629fe08e41479856e6cbcb5f45ee/0_159_1517_910/master/1517.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6a60d39cf3432dbd018fb04e8a12ef7b","title":"dont stand so close to me the new rules of social distancing","story":"As lockdown eases, meeting up with friends has become bewildering. Can you share food – or a hug? Scientists and etiquette experts weigh inFrom this week the lockdown rules in England have relaxed – groups of up to six can meet in an outdoor space, so long as they stay two metres apart. Anyone who can’t work from home has already been told to go back to work – while avoiding public transport. The sceptics among us smell a rat – with the alert level the same and the government’s five tests unmet, track-and-trace not ready and a government desperate to deflect attention from its shortcomings – is this easing really for our benefit, or just a way to kick responsibility back on to the population?\u0026nbspIn other words, we are living in one giant grey area, where judgment, common sense, good faith and, most of all, manners are going to be doing a hell of a lot of heavy lifting. So what advice do the etiquette experts – and the boffins – offer?\u0026nbspWilliam Hanson, an etiquette coach and host of the podcast Help I Sexted My Boss, was born to answer this question. “There was an awful tendency, before all this, to respond to an invitation with: ‘Who else is going to be there?’” (This implies you are checking that it will be cool enough, and is beyond rude.) “Now it is permissible, even healthy, to ask that. But you may still want to disguise the question, so if you’re bringing a cake or a homemade cordial, say: ‘Let me know how many it will be for.’” No manners specialist in town has given me an acceptable get-out for turning up only to find a packed party. Talk numbers before you arrive and then, as Debora Robertson, the co-author of Manners: A Modern Field Guide (out next spring), says: “It’s your job to express clearly what you need in a social situation, so just say: ‘I’m not ready yet for that.’” After that, it’s all in the tone and the intention. “If it’s not your intention to make people feel like they’re reckless or stupid, then that won’t come across in your tone.”\u0026nbspAgain, if you explain yourself plainly and make it a boundary of yours, a decent friend will accept that even if they think you are extremely cautious. Adam Collins, a doctor of emergency medicine, says: “If everything is washed and clean, and everyone, while they’re there, has their own inidual set of plates and cups, that should be fine.”\u0026nbspYou are now allowed to use someone else’s toilet if you wipe down surfaces afterwards. If you don’t want people to use your loo, tell them before they arrive. Regardless, Diana Mather, the author of The Good Manners Bears and host of the Granny Manners YouTube channel, has this timeless piece of advice: “Make sure you go before you leave.”If you’re happy for people to use your loo, Hanson says: “I would, as a host, put Dettol wipes out. I would hope that people got what I was trying to imply.” As a guest, you don’t then need to be sheepish about having cleaned the toilet, because they in effect told you to do that. I know. This is all getting pretty intense.\u0026nbspAccording to Mather, absolutely not as long as you would normally. The longer you are there, the more some of you will drink, the less observant of social distancing you will become, the more of an awkward spot you will put anxious friends and relatives in. It’s not a four-hour gig. It would be polite, as a host, to set the terms – shall we have a drink between six and seven? – “And if it gets to seven and people are still chatting,” Mather says, “you can push it to half past seven.” How do you make people leave, though? This bit is easy, apparently. “You stand up,” Mather says authoritatively. “Everyone should take that hint.”There is no way to not offer these around, yet I’m struggling to see how you would get a Quaver off someone without coming closer than two metres, so it’s sort of a pass-agg move. You’re asking them to either break the rules or make a big deal out of not breaking them. I think you just have to eat these things privately, or buy more than one bag of Quavers.At a whole population level, public health agencies are trying to move people away from buffet-style eating, where you are all digging in to the same bowl, and a large number of people are using the same serving spoon. However, this doesn’t mean that you can’t safely cut a cake for six people or prepare salads for people.Hanson says: “If it’s a serious breach that is breaking the rules, then fine. But be prepared, if it becomes known who reported them, that is a serious breach of friendship and you probably won’t be friends with them going forward.” Robertson is more trenchant: “We’ve all got to stop the grassing-up thing. It came too easily to some people.” I think, from both a moral and manners perspective, no.\u0026nbspIt’s really up to you, but don’t leave things because you feel embarrassed or awkward. Robertson says: “Phone them up, or email, or send a postcard to re-establish connection. Just be normal, don’t be weird.”Remember, too, that it’s not all about you. We all have a tendency to blame ourselves when communication breaks down, but it takes two not to tango. “There’s this brilliant story in the Duchess of Devonshire’s autobiography,” Robertson says. “She’s upstairs on her wedding day, and she’s waiting to come down, and 85 million people are waiting to see her. And she says to her mother: ‘I feel a bit shy.’ And her mother says: “Don’t be ridiculous, nobody’s looking at you.’” I mean, it is brilliant. But mothers are also weird.\u0026nbspI am currently going with: “I have nothing to say and I hate Zoom.”Collins takes the point: “Given that you’re allowed to have as many different sets of six people as you want, to me, that’s no different to having a barbecue of 12.” This is the moment at which you berate them with science. The magic number is because any group larger than six finds it hard to stay in the same conversation, at two metres apart, so will naturally start to cluster together. Just be reasonable, is the overall medical message here.\u0026nbspSomeone doing it by accident can be repelled by a light remark. With a deliberate offender, Hanson says, you have to be firm. “You have got to step in and say: ‘It’s two metres, I’d appreciate if you would respect that.’ I wouldn’t say sorry, necessarily. Keep it short. If you soften it too much, it will weaken the impact. I know some of my friends probably would transgress, and I just won’t meet up with them until this is over.”Children are relatively unaffected by Covid and yet Covid\u0026nbspis all we think about. But there’s a danger that because of this we might forget about their other needs altogether. Heneghan counsels strongly against this. “There’s been a lack of thinking about our younger generation, right across the board up to university age. They are at such low risk, them going back to school is no more risky than it is after Christmas, when there’s been an outbreak of influenza.” They need education, but they also need fellowship, play, fresh air and normality. So yes, they should be allowed to play with one another. If they are too young to observe any meaningful social distance, you just have to chase them apart (try not to be terrifying).Heneghan says: “I got into a car with a person on Saturday. I’m also an urgent care GP, he had to drive me around. The important point here is that we’ve come through an era where, if you’re ill, you take a paracetamol and carry on. That has to end. The important alertness is that if you feel unwell, you have to take it seriously and get yourself a test.”Collins gives something close to a definitive answer on this, and all things: “What people should focus on is not: ‘Can I do this specific thing?’ It’s: ‘What am I doing here that is genuinely beneficial or genuinely necessary?’ Lockdown is driving us all a little bit crazy and it affects some people’s mental health in really serious ways.” It’s really not as simple as: “Responsible people stay locked down for ever” and very few rules are absolute. “You have to ask yourself, honestly, whether you’re doing everything you can to protect yourself and protect others.”Oh, hello fresh minefield. Alan Redman is an organisational psychologist at Birkbeck, University of London, with a sideline in the psychology of commuter cycling. His top manners tips are: “One, wavesmile at other riders. Always. Two, don’t shout at drivers or pedestrians. Three, don’t overtake and then immediately slow down.” More broadly, he says, there is too much focus on commuting being terrifying – it is at the start, but people overcome that fairly fast and afterwards get a huge sense of zeal from their sense of legitimacy on the road and their feeling of having sailed over the fear barrier.\u0026nbspAs it is allowed for two people to meet, there is no reason you can’t go out on a date, so long as you can cope with pubs not being open. Given the two-metre distance, however, you probably can’t do much else. There is a hilarious legal loophole, here – as of this week it is illegal for two people from different households to meet indoors and have sex. The rules around outdoor gatherings, however, are guidance not law, so in theory you could breach your two-metre rule and have sex in the garden without getting arrested. So long as you weren’t overlooked, which would of course breach another law. And so long as there were six of you. No, wait …\u0026nbspYou can continue to hug members of your own household. You can definitely hug any of the six people you have just had outdoor sex with, in for a penny etc (joke! This is a joke). People I’ve been extremely tempted to hug include those who have definitely had the virus already, with the antibody test to prove it, and those who are at the end of their lives and claim not to care whether they get it or not. The expert advice remains: do not hug any of these people.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97370dc301ef574ffd5ec8bc9dd63b206fc2e131/86_199_5091_3057/master/5091.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7a48c820c2f5b36fc99b2f8ee79f1ba","title":"isolation is hard going but then so is escaping it how to ease your way out of lockdown","story":"After months of staying inside it’s natural to feel nervous about leaving the safety of our homes - even if we desperately want to. One writer, who is no stranger to self-isolating, explains what to expectIt is a strange feeling to be sick in a pandemic. I don’t just mean for the ones who fall ill from the virus. I mean the rest of us. Those who were ill long before “coronavirus” entered the vocabulary, who got sick and stir-crazy when it wasn’t headline news. Suddenly, everyone is experiencing what those of us with chronic illness have long been familiar with: the urge to break out after being trapped inside for months – and the quiet nerves about doing it.Chronically ill people are the experts in this strange new world. We are well aware the human body is not an impenetrable beast, that immune systems are fragile, that nerve endings can sting,\u0026nbspthat lungs can struggle to gasp for air.\u0026nbspWe are also used to isolation: the mind-numbing boredom of the 26th Friday without going to the pub, and the unrivalled joy of the first overpriced gin afterwards.I have not left the house for nine months, and it is more than two years since I became largely housebound.\u0026nbspI hate that word. “Housebound”. As if you were an inanimate object, tied to the back gate. The\u0026nbspbad winter flu of 2017\u0026nbspcombined with what I’ll call some D-grade genetics and I developed a kind of post-viral fatigue.\u0026nbspI’d like to downplay it for laughs, but ventilators are hard to make jokes about.\u0026nbspI couldn’t breathe, could barely move every muscle hurt.\u0026nbspIt would have been easier to have been hit by a truck, rather than just feel like it. At least I would have had a good story. But as the world is learning, viruses can be – what’s the medical term? – total bastards. I became housebound. The word doesn’t matter. The result is the same.\u0026nbspAs lockdown slowly eases, I have found myself thinking about what it is to leave the house after a long spell inside. The rest of the public will, in time, find themselves in a bizarre wonderland: visiting a friend’s house again, getting on a train, sitting in a bar.\u0026nbspThese are the firsts that are not actually firsts, the new experiences you have had a thousand times before. It would be natural if you were feeling anxious. Isolation is hard going, but then so is escaping it.\u0026nbspI’ve been through that particular looking glass myself.\u0026nbspWhen I fell ill, life in every normal way stopped. There was no going out. No inviting people in. Just bed, and my thoughts. Luckily I am fascinating, but there are limits to even my internal chat. Months pass, the pain and exhaustion hum, and\u0026nbsplife as you know it has fallen in on itself.\u0026nbspEventually, it is a\u0026nbspThursday night, though you have lost all knowledge of what day it is, and\u0026nbspyou find yourself working out how many tiny cracks there are on the walls. It is\u0026nbsp3am\u0026nbspyou think of the last time you sat in a restaurant and wonder if you ever will again.\u0026nbspI don’t know if it was growing up with a disability, but I was always the sort of person to appreciate the everyday moments. I looked at the water as the Thames rippled in the evening light. I paused to laugh as a mate danced drunk in the road (do not try this). Stuck at home, I became grateful for that, as if each frame was safely banked and the memories could be replayed on a loop.\u0026nbspWhen you are a child, they say television restricts your mind. But when you are ill, it opens it. Watching hours of\u0026nbspthe Tour de France inside four walls, I was out of bed and soaring over the sky-blue Alps. Dozing through the London marathon, I was back at work wading through the noise of the city. With Springwatch, I was in the park listening to the birds sing.\u0026nbspStill, I ached for the world. I missed people: the arms of those I knew and crowds of those I didn’t. I missed nights out: eating food someone else had cooked, the smell of cigarettes as we huddled next to a garden heater.\u0026nbspI missed getting ready to go out as much as being out: putting on an uncomfortable bra and the way mascara smells when it sets.\u0026nbspI even missed trains: the freedom of the tracks, the possibility of a departure board.\u0026nbspA few months in, I\u0026nbspbegan to collect photos. Photos of people I loved.\u0026nbspThe places I used to go the carefree smiles and the towering buildings. Instagram squares printed and hung on a grid.\u0026nbspIt was my own\u0026nbsp#lastnormalphoto\u0026nbsphashtag, except for my eyes only. When I had started to recover enough to go outside a little, I would take a photo of myself each time. At work. At the park. To prove to myself I had been there. I had done that. The trees were not a figment of my imagination. My lungs had breathed the air. I had been myself, at least for a while. I call this the narcissistic phase.\u0026nbspThe first time I saw outside again was to go to the hairdresser, which in retrospect seems apt for where we are now. It had been five months since I had fallen ill and my hair had carried on, even when I had stopped. It hadn’t occurred to me to try a lockdown-style home cut and I resembled a pasty Rapunzel.\u0026nbspWhen your body has denied you the chance to take the mundane excursions most people do every day, having that opportunity again feels electrifying.\u0026nbspIn the spring air, the blossom unfurled and lined the streets with pink.\u0026nbspChunks of blond hair dropped to the floor, the smell of perming solution in the air.\u0026nbspManoeuvring through the streets to go back home, I fixed on the surroundings. The paths lined with blooming trees, the strangers carrying the weekly shop.\u0026nbspIt felt like a scene from that\u0026nbsp90s\u0026nbspBrendan Fraser film where the time-travelling caveman\u0026nbspsees cars for the first time. Wonder mixed with terror.\u0026nbspThere is a feeling, somewhere between walking through your front door and reaching Superdrug, when your brain wants to protect you from the outside world. You tell yourself you are going to die, possibly next to the tampons. You are not, of course, and you breathe slowly, reminding yourself that you used to do this all the time. That you are fine. That you are actually great.I remember the panic attack I had the third time I went outside again, but I remember the happiness, too. The 99 I slowly licked in the park and the towering Flake, like I was\u0026nbspeight years old again, triumphant by the ice-cream van at the school gates. I remember the utter joy of holding people I loved for the first time in a year: the smell of familiar perfume and the feel of stubble on my cheek. I remember the other\u0026nbspfeeling wavering in my stomach: relief.\u0026nbspI had found something that I had lost, if only for a little while.\u0026nbspI won’t pretend chronic illness is the same as lockdown. One occurs because sickness has already come, the other is an attempt to avoid it. One is usually permanent, the other is temporary – even if doesn’t feel like it.\u0026nbspBut the lines between healthy and sick seem more blurred than they used to. Or, to put it another way, we are all a little housebound now.\u0026nbspEstablished wisdom says not to take advice from someone in their pyjamas, but if I could offer any, it would be this.\u0026nbspThe thing that tends to keep you awake at night during these times is not what you miss, but the fear that you will never get it back.\u0026nbspYou almost certainly will. You will in time regain the precious things: hug your mum, sit in a theatre, gorge on a McDonald’s at the end of a night out.\u0026nbspThere is such happiness in that – in rediscovering the people and places we love. But it is not ungrateful if you\u0026nbspfeel less than joy, if you feel some pressure or panic lurking at the thought of going back outside. It is kind to give yourself time to readjust. To go just half a\u0026nbspmile from home at first. To start small.\u0026nbspSavour the little details ground yourself in the sights and sounds. The unfurling of the lilac. Your best friend’s laugh.\u0026nbspIf you still find yourself struggling, that’s OK too. Don’t pathologise normal human responses. If you have not seen your sister in months, it is perfectly natural to be sad. If you haven’t been in a crowd since March, it is easy to be anxious – even more so if you’re shielding and are now going out for the very first time.\u0026nbspSimilarly, if you find those feelings dominating your mind and restricting your ability to get on, professional help is there. It is well known that mental health support is not always available on the NHS, but GPs are still the best start. Many therapists are now online, and some are even free.People talk about a grand return to normal after lockdown but the truth is, “normal” is hard to refind. Nothing is waiting for you exactly as you left it events inevitably alter our viewpoint, each of us rarely leaves a rough period unmarked. And that is OK.\u0026nbspThings change. Nothing is guaranteed. You adapt, perhaps even finding something better than before.\u0026nbspWe are taught to always be moving. That a night in front of Netflix is wasted. That Fomo is the modern way.If being unable to leave home does anything, it helps you re-evaluate those particular untruths. “Home”\u0026nbspis just a different way of living, no less because it is smaller. It is a thing to be valued, to perhaps see more kindly than before. But if – when – you do get back out in the world, it will be all the more beautiful from your time away. Lick an ice-cream on a bench, as the summer sun warms your skin.\u0026nbspMemories go round on a loop, inviting us out once again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f39deed28b55e2f34a27485f88f2975bcce55f2e/0_1391_4222_2531/master/4222.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e59583a3db66a5f4fb1819e41548a88","title":"hey beeb new bbc digital assistant gets northern male accent","story":"UK service promises ‘warm and friendly’ tone to rival female alternatives from US like Amazon’s AlexaThe BBC has given its new digital assistant a male voice to avoid the “problematic associations” of female-voiced rivals such as Amazon’s Alexa, which have faced criticism for reinforcing gender stereotypes.The voice-activated service, named “Beeb”, will have a limited public release this week and the corporation said it put extra thought into what accent would make it distinct from other US-developed services.As a result people who wake up the voice assistant by saying “Hey Beeb” will be greeted with a “warm and friendly” accent from the north of England, guiding them towards BBC programmes and offering localised news and weather reports.Andy Webb, who is leading the BBC’s development of its voice technology, said this “reflected the ersity of the audience in the UK” and as a result it did not have the “sterile feel” or “problematic associations” of other assistants.A Unesco report\u0026nbsplast year claimed that the often submissive and flirty responses offered by female-voiced digital assistants to many queries – including abusive ones – reinforced ideas of women as subservient.Grace Boswood, the chief operating officer of the BBC’s design and engineering department, said a key reason for undertaking the project was to defend against encroachment from US tech companies and to maintain a direct relationship with licence-fee payers.“It gives us a strategic hedge if Amazon decide not to play fair in terms of how people access the content,” she said, suggesting the BBC had an 18-month window of opportunity to establish a viable voice assistant before habits were locked down. “There has to be an alternative to them holding all the cards. We do have the content. Amazon may choose to change the game of discovery.”She said a major fear was that tech firms may start recommending their own content using data gleaned from BBC programmes, hurting public service broadcasters: “The threat to us is, ‘You’ve finished the Archers, here’s a Joe Rogan podcast.’”There is no intention for the BBC to produce its own physical hardware, such as Amazon’s Echo speakers. Instead, the Beeb voice assistant has been designed in the hope that the software can be built into a variety of existing and future systems. Potential uses include powering the BBC Sounds app, adding extra controls to car stereos, and potentially even operating on Amazon’s platform.However, as yet the only deal signed has been with Microsoft, which will launch the service to desktop-based beta testers on Wednesday. The success or failure of the service, which relies on Microsoft’s AI software, is likely depend on whether the BBC can convince other platforms to incorporate Beeb into their offering.The Beeb voice assistant will have a much more limited set of functions than other rivals but the intention is that it will be better at providing access to BBC content, while offering up jokes from the Mash Report and facts from QI. People who swear at the assistant will be asked if they would like to listen to a BBC podcast.\u0026nbspThe fear within the BBC is that if it cedes control of both the user experience and user data to Amazon and Google then the UK’s national broadcaster will be left playing second fiddle to tech companies in yet another area. At least one in five British homes now has a smart speaker, according to Ofcom, driven by cheap sales of kit such as Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Assistant. This is causing listening habits to change as people replace old radios that were permanently tuned to existing stations with voice-activated kit.There is already concerns that the BBC and other public service broadcasters have lost their prominence on television sets, with owners of modern smart TVs being offered a choice of apps from the likes of Netflix and Amazon when they turn on their sets rather than going to BBC One by default.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d999d78c367891690c375cd67573f8726a9916e/33_122_2455_1474/master/2455.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b811ae0839abcedc3ff8d13874c11bc7","title":"anywhere but westminster online covid 19 uk","story":"In lockdown, our series is using footage sent in from around the UK to tell the story of the world outside the political bubbleThe day after the 2019 general election we were on an early-morning train from Stoke-on-Trent to London, feeling as if a long and messy chapter of recent British history had at last come to some kind of full stop. Brexit was a certainty, the Conservatives had won a big parliamentary majority, and the Labour party was more estranged than ever from its old heartlands. Having covered a country in mounting political ferment since 2010, we thought we could at least put Anywhere but Westminster on pause.But in March, everything changed once again. As the Covid-19 crisis reached the decisive point of lockdown, we decided the series had to be reawakened. But if we were as subject to the new restrictions as anyone else, and just as scared of the virus, how could we do it?The answer has defined our experience of the past two months. Instead of travelling to places, we have issued call-outs for information about what people are living through, and footage of their lives, usually shot on their phones. In addition, often using contacts we have acquired over the past 10 years, we have approached old and new sources, and asked them to participate. A mountain of video has arrived, which we and our team have spent long days and nights combining with our own material and turning into finished films. The result, by a mixture of accident and design, has been an ongoing series of videos that tells the story of this crisis from the core of people’s actual experience.We’ve chronicled the lives of a 26-year-old man whose arthritis medication suppresses his immune system, meaning he has to live in complete isolation, and an intensive care nurse who facilitates people saying their last goodbyes via Zoom. We’ve spoken to families whose experience of lockdown is light years away from any “bake cakes and learn Spanish” cliches, and people who have spoken movingly about losing loved ones. Crucially, we have also gone out of our way to explore how communities have come together, and provided new kinds of support to friends and neighbours.Unintentionally, it feels like what we’re doing is true to most people’s experience of the crisis – and, in particular, the mixture of an often lonely world suddenly mediated via the internet, and an unexpected sense of common purpose and togetherness. It sometimes feels as if encouraging people to document their own experiences is sparking a change in the way we feel about our journalism, and presenting us with a new challenge we will have to face when the crisis recedes: how to push even further beyond the standard approaches of the media, and give an even more authentic sense of where the country is going.For now, one thing seems particularly clear. The convulsive political events of the past 10 years were at least partly about rising inequality and insecurity, and people’s sense that power was too distant. Covid-19 has highlighted those things to the point that they are even more inescapable than before – which, for us, means that the work has to go on.Stay at home, keep your distance from people and don’t mix with anyone outside of your circle: the rules of lockdown are almost the polar opposite of the rules of Anywhere but Westminster.Our process has been to get out there to places the media doesn’t normally visit, get close to people, and talk to those outside our bubble. Seeing a political media that was too socially distant, we wanted to counteract it with a kind of journalistic gap-closing.Through the ruptures of Corbynism, Brexit, and the rise of populism, the idea that there was a gap between the way politics was presented in the news and lived in the world became accepted, and even a cliche. After 10 years, I sometimes felt like one of an ageing pair of small-time bank robbers, always coming back for one last job.But coronavirus and the resulting lockdown brought us new purpose – or a new version of our old purpose. Once again, the news was dominated by images from government briefings from Westminster and political journalists trying to hold them to account – this time over Zoom. There was also a blizzard of figures: infection rates, deaths, jobs lost, workers in furlough. We wanted to give more space to ordinary people to speak – putting human stories to those numbers and policies, but also capturing the ways in which communities were coming together to help each other.Same old problem, then: the difference is that we are working from our bedrooms and putting the films together using footage sent to us by people around Britain. Like everything else about this moment, it’s been a journey of discovery, with highs and lows. I will not miss wrestling with hundreds of clips shot in different formats, sent to me along with a constant stream of messages, questions, and pinging alerts. But I have also found moments of emotion in the footage that it would be hard to match in anything I shot myself.A paradox has become clear: while the issues we cover have always been bottom-up, the process of making a film that has a narrative viewers will watch and engage with is a very top-down process, requiring lots of control in the hands of the person filming and editing. Normally we videographers film with great attention to detail, trying to get each shot just right, and capturing every aspect of a scene in sequences of shots. Now I’m in collaboration with people who don’t even hold the camera the right way round (hint: it’s not vertical). But what they lack in technical skills they have made up for in authenticity.So, in many ways, this has been a process of letting go – of the old standards that we thought were so important, and of the visual “grammar” we have taken for granted. Instead we have found value in a new kind of intimacy and sincerity that comes from people having filmed their own stories, and the greater sense of control they have in the process. And we have tried to lay open the process to the viewers. In some ways this version of Anywhere but Westminster is the most true to its original vision. Hopefully it will open up new ways of thinking about how we do our video journalism and share power with the people we report on, and at the same time encourage people to see the power in capturing and documenting these times in video for themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e971f09d90ed491b52bbdb4d0d60085ef898593/0_0_4830_2898/master/4830.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70b6b2d50eb2460d6ad3265f0afda4cc","title":"argos didnt refund my 255 for a faulty dishwasher","story":"I’ve tried to get through by email and web chat, and waited for hours on the phoneWe bought a Hotpoint dishwasher from Argos in February which never worked.

David Hunter, professor of epidemiology and medicine at the University of Oxford, looks at the risks Early estimates of R0, the original infection rate, for Covid-19 were in the range of 2.0 to 3.0, but more recent estimates have come in at 4.0 or more. This is substantially higher than the usual estimate for influenza of about 1.4 to 2.0. The infection rate dropped incrementally with the series of recommendations that started on 12 March, but did not fall precipitously until the full lockdown was announced 11 days later. Those restrictions have meant the R0 now appears to be below 1.0 in the UK, and on Monday the government eased some of the lockdown rules, allowing people to meet outside in groups of up to six, outdoor markets and car showrooms to begin operating again, and schools to reopen.

If it wasn’t already bad enough that the UK has the highest mortality rate in Europe and Dominic Cummings is given a free pass on his midnight flit to Durham and a 60-mile round trip eyesight test, the Tory government has now decided to turn the House of Commons into the world’s worst theme park. One where the only attraction is the kilometre-long queue itself for a ride that doesn’t exist.Some countries have used the global health crisis to discover the best of themselves. We have actively worked on becoming the worst possible iteration of ourselves. Still, at least the rest of the world can piss themselves laughing at our expense. So maybe look on it as a global public service.To recap. Before the Whitsun recess, the Commons had a perfectly serviceable hybrid participation procedure, along with a fully functional remote voting system, to enable parliament to operate during the coronavirus pandemic. But Jacob Rees-Mogg wasn’t happy with that. Having spent several weeks trying to close down the Commons last year during the unlawful prorogation, the leader of the house has now decided he wants it to make it as inaccessible for MPs as possible.Anyone who is over 70, is pregnant or has health, childcare or travel issues is now effectively barred from parliament. With their constituents disenfranchised. Jakey likes to pretend to be the great parliamentarian – the master democrat steeped in centuries of tradition – but the reality is that Westminster is just a stage on which he gets to cosplay his public school fantasies in a suit that’s several sizes too big for him. Ideally the only people he wants in the Commons are people just like him: MPs with large London houses, a private income and an inherited nanny.For reasons best know to himself – perhaps he had forgotten the chamber was still restricted to 50 MPs so he would still be basically on his own during prime minister’s questions – Boris Johnson chose to indulge Jakey’s perversions by turning the vote into a three-line whip for Tory MPs. And as most of them are barely sensate lobby fodder with no mind of their own, they duly obliged by voting to deny other MPs a vote. Not for the first time in the past few weeks, the UK was putting on a good show of acting like a banana republic.Still, at least we got to enjoy the spectacle of Tory MPs having to suffer the humiliation of waiting for 43 minutes in a queue that snaked round Westminster Hall and back into Portcullis House. I shouldn’t think Jakey and Liam Fox can remember the last time they had to queue for anything. And even when they got to the front, dozens could barely manage to blurt out their names and what they were voting for. Tory Stephen Crabb first went down the “no” side while shouting aye, before changing direction and heading for the “aye” side where he promptly said no.It was low comedy performed by a cast of Tory grotesques who couldn’t even manage to observe the basics of physical distancing. As if they believed themselves immune to a disease that had already killed 60,000 people – with a lot of help from their own government – by virtue of their own importance. Some at least had the grace to look slightly ashamed to be participating in this profoundly undemocratic land grab but Maria Miller appeared unrepentant. Until earlier this year, Miller had been chair of the women and equalities committee but was now more than happy to trample all over those whom she used to pretend to care about. How she sleeps at night is anyone’s guess.Unfortunately for the opposition MPs and the handful of Tory MPs with a conscience, they also had to participate in the farce. Not once but twice, as the government had to first see off an amendment tabled by the Tory chair of the procedure committee, Karen Bradley, that proposed to maintain the hybrid status quo until the end of the summer. Some managed to maintain a modicum of good humour first time round, but as the exercise in futility extended towards the 90-minute mark many began to look seriously pissed off and their votes were cast with a definite edge in their voice. Kevin Brennan spat out the words “Mogg shambles”.Then the voting merely reflected the nature of the debate. Only this time we were seeing the “one rule for the elite, another for the rest of us” enshrined in law. It’s government policy for people to still work from home wherever possible, and here was Jakey and the rest of the cabinet actively making it impossible for MPs to work from home. If the government can treat its co-workers that badly, just imagine the contempt it has for the rest of us. Lou Reed had it about right. Give me your hungry, your tired, your poor I’ll piss on them. Your poor huddled masses, let’s club them to death.But it was all just water off Jakey and Boris’s back: Jakey even joked about the similarities to Alton Towers by telling MPs he had taken his sister Stigmata to the theme park. An opportunity for a cynical erosion of parliamentary democracy had been there for the taking and they hadn’t been able to refuse a gift horse. There had to be an upside of the coronavirus somewhere and it could make Brexit a little less hassle. And the donkeys had just gone along with it. From now on, every vote will be a 45-minute conga, with at least a hundred or more MPs effectively excluded. The Tories have effectively taken us from a modern voting system to one that would have been rejected in the Middle Ages.If I was an opposition MP, I’d tell any Tory asking for a pair to sod off. Make them all turn up and pray for the wettest June on record.\u0026nbspLet it rain. Let them get soaked three times a day as the rest of the world sniggers at us.

My assessment is that that’s not very likely – fishing remains an emblematic issue for the government,” said Deas.\u0026nbspHis comments came as the fourth round of Brexit talks about trade and the future relationship between the UK and the EU began on Tuesday.In the past week, both sides have lowered their expectations, saying they think it is unlikely the impasse on fisheries and other issues will be broken.\u0026nbspAt a press briefing, Deas said the industry did not support an extension to the transition period and that skirmishes between English and French fishing leaders would be almost inevitable.\u0026nbsp“France benefits more than anybody else from relative stability from the current quota shares. If there’s any change to that, those quota shares or any other aspect that affects French fishermen, as day follows night there will be blockades, they have done it for much less in the past,” said Deas.He said other countries take “a much more pragmatic” view and recognise that “quota shares will have to change”.“There will be a reaction in France by the fishermen, that’s just the nature of the beast,” he said but added that that was not a reason “not to do what we’re doing” or to extend the transition period.Two years ago, British and French boats clashed in the Channel in what became known as the “scallop wars”.Elspeth Macdonald, the chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation, warned that the French had much to lose if talks break down, with 5,000 jobs in Boulogne dependent on the business.She also pointed out that the fishing industry by value is worth “about £1bn in each direction”. However, this is split by 11 nations, with Ireland, France, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Denmark and the Netherlands being particularly hit by any reduced access to British waters.Last week, the EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said he had spoken to 11 fishing ministers and there would be no change to his mandate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/324953b35e1e542df687f0a0687867f2b40cf832/0_36_1086_652/master/1086.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07e635389347d42dfeb63e8912098405","title":"lost father covid 19 legal action against uk government","story":"Dr Minesh Talati wants accountability not just for his father’s death, but the other coronavirus victims who didn’t need to dieI took my father into hospital on 20 March, because I was sure he had coronavirus. We walked in together. He had worked for 46 years as a community pharmacist and I am a dentist. Neither of us had any idea that his situation would deteriorate to the point that I would be turning off his ventilator four weeks later.My 74-year-old mother also got Covid-19, as did my pregnant wife. They recovered, but I could easily have lost all of them. I believe my father’s death, like so many others, didn’t need to happen. I want transparency, clarification of the facts and accountability not just for me, but for the tens of thousands of people who have lost loved ones.We need an inquiry, but more urgently, given that we’re still in the middle of the crisis, we need to learn from mistakes. That is all I have ever asked for and that is why I’m taking legal action against the government and Public\u0026nbspHealth\u0026nbspEngland (PHE), on the basis that the health secretary and PHE failed to comply with their duties under the Human Rights Act regarding the right to life.I knew something was wrong. I had a high heart rate, which I thought was strange. I managed to get a private test done which came back positive for Covid-19. I was ultra-worried because I’d seen my parents before I had symptoms. My father had otherwise been isolating because of his age, like I had told him to.Assuming a median incubation period of five to six days as the medical papers suggest, followed by seven days of symptoms, I must have caught Covid-19 at the end of February. On 13 March, over a week before lockdown was introduced, the scientific advisory group of emergencies (Sage) concluded “there are more cases in the UK than previously thought and we may therefore be further ahead of the epidemic curve”.Even though he was 80, my dad was very fit. When I took him in to hospital, the ward was half-empty. A few days later it was packed. Staff were off because they had symptoms and couldn’t get tested. There were so many bank nurses who were stretched and not used to working in an environment of infection. I could see how things would escalate.My dad didn’t want to die. He survived for weeks on the ventilator but his doctors and I knew that if he ever came off it, he wouldn’t be able to lead the life he had done before. He would have hated that. I went into a side room with the consultant’s permission in full personal protective equipment which I had bought Dad was unconscious and heavily sedated. I held his hand and said, “Dad, I’m really sorry that I couldn’t keep the promise I made you four weeks ago saying you’d be home by the end of the week.” I said I should have been more wary, that it should be me in that bed.It was so painful and surreal. Sometimes I still can’t acknowledge it happened, I think I’m having a bad dream.I believe the health secretary did not do all that could reasonably be expected to avoid a real and immediate risk to life of which he had knowledge.Why did the government stop testing in those early days? Why didn’t it inform us when it knew there was community transmission in February? The UK doesn’t have the second highest mortality rate in the world for no reason. If the government and PHE had put this information in the public domain, and people still broke the rules of lockdown, that would have been different. It would have been because they’d disobeyed something the government had done to protect us.Lives would have been lost under Covid-19 but I believe if the government and PHE had acted sooner with the information that they had, the death rate would have been substantially lower.Once these matters are addressed hopefully we can prevent this from ever happening again. There will be more clusters of coronavirus and there may well be a second wave. We need to learn from the mistakes now, rather than later.More information can be found here: www.crowdjusticecaseholding-the-government-to-account"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4d588d7136905952f916162cde28da3b2eaa13f/0_132_4928_2959/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cba40f24ddbf7ac0f4e718bda28ea0ab","title":"record numbers used uk food banks in first month of lockdown","story":"Charities say government support is failing to protect low-income familiesPoverty campaigners have called for an emergency cash support scheme to help struggling low-income households after UK food bank charities reported that the first full month of coronavirus lockdown was their “busiest ever”.The charities said their experience of record food bank use in April, following a huge surge in food aid in March, showed it was clear that current social security safety net measures were not enough to prevent poorer families being swept into destitution.The number of families with children who received food parcels almost doubled in April compared to the the same period last year, the Trussell Trust said, a rise it described as unprecedented.Ifan said half of the 132 food banks it surveyed had expanded operations to cope with rising demand in April, taking on more volunteers and opening more venues. A third had increased the size of inidual food parcels to support people for longer.Trussell Trust chief executive Emma Revie said: “People need to be able to put food on their table. The government must put urgent support in place to ensure people already struggling to keep their heads above water and stay afloat.”Although government emergency measures such as the job retention scheme had helped, many families were already falling through the gaps and more support would be needed when those measures wind down over the coming months, charities said.They called for local authorities to be funded to re-provide emergency cash grants to families through local welfare schemes. Many of these schemes have been drastically reduced or wound up in recent years.This should be implemented alongside a rise in benefit rates for families with children, a suspension of benefit deductions on advance loans given out to cover claimants through the five-week wait for universal credit, and a lifting of the benefit cap.Child Poverty Action Group chief executive Alison Garnham said: “No parent wants to depend on charity to feed their own child but\u0026nbspit is clear that food\u0026nbspbanks are becoming the only option for a growing number of families whose finances have all but collapsed because of Covid-19.\u0026nbspStruggle is turning to real hardship.”Ifan coordinator Sabine Goodwin said: “Our food bank figures paint a grim picture of what is unfolding across the UK and the numbers of people having to resort to emergency food parcels to survive. But the solution to the escalating food insecurity crisis has never been the provision of charitable food aid. Everyone needs to be able to afford to buy food\u0026nbspand the\u0026nbspbare essentials.”\u0026nbspA government spokesperson said: “We understand that this is a difficult time for people on low incomes and we’ve taken significant action to support those affected by coronavirus, including through\u0026nbspincome protection schemes, mortgage holidays and additional support for renters.\u0026nbsp“For those most in need we’ve injected more than £6.5bn into the welfare system, which includes an increase to\u0026nbspuniversal credit of up to £1,040 a year. No one has to wait five weeks for money as urgent payments are available, while some people\u0026nbspmay be eligible for a nine-month grace period where their income is not capped.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8a41952f75465c3c298f778df91c5d4f8d98b5c/278_0_1363_818/master/1363.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80d025de9609225f7c18795aecdcddf9","title":"they used to call me retard dark time dying inside shaun webster mbe learning disability","story":"Shaun Webster once faced abuse, but now has an MBE for helping others with a learning disability, he reveals in a new book I am standing on my dad’s doorstep. It’s 20 years since he called me a retard. I haven’t seen much of him since then. He told me I’d never work, never live on my own, never have a relationship. I came on the bus from the flat where I live alone. I’ve got an ex-girlfriend standing next to me for moral support. I haven’t told my dad I’m coming.He opens the door. He smells of booze. He looks at me, confused.“All right, Dad? You still a pisshead?”“You can’t talk to me like that!” he says.“Why not?” I say. “You’ve said so much bad stuff to me. You told me I’d never have a job, never live on my own. I’ve been abroad, Dad. I’ve met Prince Charles. He gave me this MBE.” I hold up the medal.He’s gobsmacked. I feel proud that I proved him wrong.I’ve been wanting this day for years. It’s not revenge – it’s to prove who I am now.In the past, I used to be ashamed of my learning disability because my dad used to put me down. I used to feel embarrassed, like a second-class citizen. But not now. My learning disability is a bit of me, but it’s not a big deal and it doesn’t define me. It hasn’t stopped me having a life.At 21, I moved into a council flat in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, with my younger brother. The flat was close to my mum who had split up from my dad by then. She’s an amazing woman and we have a brilliant relationship. My brother supported me with things like reading letters and cooking. I love my brother but I wanted to cook, clean, dust, pay my bills – just like a normal person.The stepping stone to self-belief for me was when I got my own place. I got help from KeyRing – an organisation which supports people to live independently.You wouldn’t know it now, but a long time ago I was like a doormat. I didn’t have any qualifications when I left school (they don’t teach you much at special school), but I got a job as a trainee hotel porter and then moved on to housekeeping work and handyman jobs at the hotel. I enjoyed it because I was meeting new people and earning my own wage. I felt like a proper adult.My next job in a warehouse was sweeping up, packing and taking boxes to the skip. The boss didn’t trust me to do anything else. I started to get very bored.The other blokes used to abuse me physically and mentally because of my disability. They used to call me – and I hate these words – “retard” and “spacca” (as in ‘spastic’). They’d mock me because I used to stutter quite badly. They’d imitate me talking because of my speech impediment. I hated that job because for the next five years I was bullied, ridiculed and abused. The first time someone said something to me I was on the second floor of the warehouse, pulling boxes off shelves. I heard “retard” from behind me, someone calling out. I said “what?”, like I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Another time, someone lobbed a shoe at me and it got me in the head. I wanted to punch them, but I didn’t want to lose my job. They used to throw boxes at me too. I asked them why and they said, “We were joking.” I told them I didn’t find it funny.Every time I reported the abuse, I thought, what’s the point? I’d get called “grass”. I used to get very down and I felt very small, like I was less of a human being. I was a dad by then and I needed that £100 a week, so I had to stick it out because of my kids and partner at the time, and I wanted to be independent. I used to cry when I got home, but I’d think at least it was another day done.It was a really dark time. I was dying inside.Eventually I heard about a job going at the human rights charity CHANGE. I got an interview through the support charity that had got me the warehouse job. There were two people with learning disabilities on the panel, which made me feel equal and respected. I told them I had experience of life as a father with a learning disability and I was passionate about our rights.Before this job I’d never been further than South Yorkshire. Now as an international project worker with CHANGE, I travel all over the world to to train professionals to work better with children and young people with learning disabilities and to support the young people to speak up for themselves. This builds my confidence. I eventually lost my stutter. In the past I didn’t use the telephone because I thought people wouldn’t understand me, but I do now.I’ve also co-authored a book called Leaving Institutions, Voices for Change, that aims to help social workers involved in moving people out of long-term residential care.I think that without work I’d be very timid, isolated and lonely, and I wouldn’t have a voice. The best thing about my job is that it’s helped me challenge people in a way that’s professional.I can’t read or write very well, but you can get around that. Apps on computers mean I can dictate my emails. I get government funding for disabled people in work it’s called Access to Work and it pays for someone to help with paperwork two mornings a week.Of course, being a father and grandfather is an achievement. I’ve got two grown-up children in their 20s and a 15-year-old daughter, who lives with my former partner in Sheffield. My daughter says, “My dad works to make things better for people with learning disabilities.” I listen to people a lot and they trust me. At work my nickname’s Father Shaun.When I became a dad, the first thing I got asked at the warehouse was, “Has the baby got a learning disability?” They asked this even before they asked if we’d had a boy or a girl. None of my kids have disabilities, but if they did, it wouldn’t be a big deal. It’s just a label people put on you.I wish the older Shaun could go back to the younger Shaun and tell him what I’ve done. I’m not sure the younger Shaun would believe him.Other people with learning disabilities can achieve great things too. I came from nowhere with no power and no self-respect. I didn’t know about my human rights. My message is this: Never stop believing in yourself don’t let other people tell you that you can’t do it. If you’ve got something you want to do, then do do it. I think before you try and inspire others to believe in themselves, you have to believe in yourself. And don’t take any crap.• This is an edited extract of Shaun Webster’s story, Father Shaun, from Made Possible: Stories of success by people with learning disabilities – in their own words, edited by Saba Salman.

The thing we’re doubling down on is PPE: in Gatsby you’re invited to a party so we’ve made it a masquerade ball which requires a mask, so we’re managing to incorporate that into the show.”The plan is to reopen on 1 October with a capacity of 90, with an additional 10 cast and three crew members. Certain scenes will be cut, including a group charleston for 250 people, and they are experimenting with having an A and B cast, which means if someone presents symptoms of Covid-19 they will have enough actors to keep the show going.“Gatsby lends itself to social distancing between people and they have the agency to move around the space as you see fit as an audience member,” Hook said.\u0026nbspThe action will take place in one large space, with smaller breakout rooms for groups of up to four ticketholders, rather than 20 people pre-Covid-19.The return of The Great Gatsby is a rare positive story for British theatre, which has been completely shuttered because of Covid-19, with many predicting it will be left decimated because of the financial impact. Julian Bird, the chief executive of the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre, said British theatre companies had already lost about £330m because of the lockdown.In early May, the theatre producer\u0026nbspSir Cameron Mackintosh said the lockdown measures imposed because of the Covid-19 outbreak meant West End theatres were unlikely to be able to reopen until 2021. Sonia Friedman, the producer behind West End hits such as The Book of Mormon and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, wrote in the  (paywall) that British theatre was on the “brink of total collapse” and needed an urgent government rescue package.Hartshorn and Hook ssaid immersive theatre’s ability to put on performances in larger spaces meant they were well positioned to be pioneers of the art form’s return as Covid-19 continued to mean many institutions remained closed.“Every single piece of traditional theatre is a massive challenge at the moment,” said Hartshorn. “We produced Amélie, which was nominated for three Olivier awards. The only way we could conceive of that going ahead is moving into a theatre that is three times the size of the one we had planned.”The producers joined the calls for government support and clearer guidelines for venues that are desperate to reopen as soon as possible. “It’s been hard to watch the government not stepping in and saying ‘here’s the plan’,” said Hook. “The Arts Council’s £160m is a drop in the ocean compared to other countries and there are so many cracks for people to fall through.”There have been other innovative attempts to bring theatre back. The\u0026nbspBig House\u0026nbspvenue in north London has announced a socially distanced production and is inviting six audience members at a time to watch the performances of its play The Ballad of Corona V.\u0026nbspThe Old Vic announced last week that Claire Foy and Matt Smith will return in June for a series of “socially distanced performances” of the play Lungs, which will be performed to an empty auditorium and live-streamed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb89be772925525dffe4cfd01635221039f00086/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f74e176db116dc1841c55b0d6938b9e7","title":"share your favourite holiday memory of italy","story":"Reveal your top Italian holiday moment, whether it’s culture or hospitality, seaside, city or rolling landscapeWith the Colosseum, Leaning Tower of Pisa and Uffizi gallery – not to mention Italy’s thousands of bars, cafes, restaurants and gelaterias – open to foreign visitors this week, we’d love to hear about your favourite memory of what is Brits’ third most-popular holiday destination.It may be a while before we can head off to enjoy la dolce vita, but in the meantime tell us all about your top Italian experience – maybe a family-run trattoria or idyllic agriturismo, a gorgeous beach or an amazing walking trail, a vineyard or an art gallery.Please use the form below to explain what made this place so special for you, including precise locations and websites where possible, and keeping your tip to around 100 words.Send your tip by Tuesday 9 June at 10am BST.

It was mid-March – the last days before Europe went into lockdown. I went to Slovenia’s\u0026nbspmost\u0026nbspfamous cave system to witness something that might now, in the shadow of pandemic and imploding economies, seem frivolous: a sneak peek at what was to be the first public display of recently hatched olms:\u0026nbspblind, worm-like amphibians that are one of nature’s most remarkable underground\u0026nbspcreatures.\u0026nbspBut barely had the\u0026nbspyoung olms\u0026nbspsettled into their new vivarium than Postojna Cave closed to visitors for the longest time in its 200-year history.\u0026nbspPostojna’s 24km cave system – 50km south of the capital Ljubljana, and just a 40-minute drive from Trieste in Italy – is one of Europe’s most-visited subterranean attractions. In pre-Covid-19\u0026nbspyears nearly a million tourists took the red-and-yellow train through its caverns into\u0026nbspa floodlit, cathedral-size\u0026nbspchamber – and\u0026nbspPostojna’s\u0026nbspmost-photographed rock formation, the five-metre-tall “Brilliant” stalagmite.\u0026nbspThey would file past a tank of adult olms, with its dim red lighting to protect their photosensitive skinsand visit the world’s only underground post office, complete with its own stamp and postmark.Slovenia has fared better than many of its European neighbours through the\u0026nbspCovid-19 crisis\u0026nbsp- with 1,473 cases and 109 deaths to date. Bars and restaurants reopened on 5 May\u0026nbspand on Wednesday the lights will go up again in Postojna Cave. Public health measures include 1.5-metre social distancing, mandatory masks, the sanitising of equipment in between tours, and a limit of 60 people per train (instead of the usual 116). On 11 June, the young olms – or, as everyone in the cave calls them, the “baby dragons” – will at last go on display.If olms are dragons, Primož\u0026nbspGnezda, a blond biologist with a beatific smile and complexion untroubled by the sun of the over-world, is their handler. As Postojna’s resident biologist, he spends his days in the cave, observing creatures that remain stubbornly mysterious, even to scientists who dedicate careers to their study.Local legend had it that the olm (also known as the proteus or human fish) was the offspring of cave-dwelling dragons – it’s as good a way as any of explaining the strange, pink wrigglers that were washed out of the caves after heavy rain. The truth is hardly less extraordinary. Olms are neotenous, meaning they retain juvenile characteristics for all of their 100-year lifes – they never lose the pink external gills that look like sea anemone tentacles. At 30cm long, adult olms are the world’s largest subterranean animals these aquatic salamanders are also blind, sensing light and vibration through their skin and sensory pits on their heads. Their hearts beat just twice a minute, and they can go more than a decade without food.A display of adult olms has been\u0026nbsppart of Postojna’s offering since the\u0026nbspearly 19th century (they are mentioned in a 1868 Baedeker Guide), but the creature considered by some to be Slovenia’s national animal had never bred in captivity in the country before (the French, to Slovenian\u0026nbspchagrin, managed it in the 1950s). Nor had olms ever been seen breeding in the wild. So when, in 2016, a translucent spherical olm egg appeared on the glass of Postojna’s main vivarium, Gnezda and his colleagues couldn’t believe their luck. More eggs appeared. The nation held its breath for an agonising 120 days before 22 babies hatched in the underground laboratory.The babies have already yielded insights into olm behaviour. Researchers knew the animals could regrow lost limbs, but when one of the young tore off a sibling’s leg, they were able to study the regeneration process up close. Yet much about the amphibians remains mysterious. We have no idea how many olms live in the wild, nor even how many species there are, says Lilijana Mali, an amphibians expert at Ljubljana University. Her team think there are probably nine types, scattered throughout the Adriatic limestone karst. They do know, though, that the amphibians are sensitive to pollution as well as light, which makes Postojna’s breeding success all the more vital.Like skiing for the Norwegians or surfing for Hawaiians, caving is a national pastime in Slovenia. The limestone bedrock of this country of 2 million people is peppered with more than 13,000 caves. To experience the realm of the wild olms, I pulled on overalls, helmet and wellies and left behind the vivarium and the tourist train. Caver and guide Roman Bogataj, who studies astrophysics in his spare time, was to be my guide, and I warned him that I suffer from mild claustrophobia. “Just think of it as a walk with nice scenery,” he said, with a stroke of his beard.We followed an easy path along a thundering subterranean river, then turned off into a side chamber known as the Colourful Passage. Translucent curtain stalactites hung from the ceiling and the floor was adorned with cave pearls, glinting stalagmites and jumbled red rocks. Then Roman nonchalantly invited me to crawl through an oval opening in the rock face, a mere olm’s-length high. “I can fit, so for you it’s no problem,” he smiled, patting his modest belly.\u0026nbspI peered into the hole and felt darts of adrenalin shoot down my legs, but with Roman’s reassurance, and against every instinct, I found myself squirming into the crevice. The rock squeezed my chest from below and above, narrowing to a point where I had to angle my helmeted head to one side to fit through. I belly-wriggled and kicked until I was alone in a chamber that was the stillest place I’ve ever been.Roman joined me and we clicked off our headtorches. For a few clockless minutes we experienced the world the baby dragons know: a place of silence and deep, smothering darkness, to which my thoughts have often turned in the long lockdown months since. When Roman switched on his torch I found myself like the olm, flinching from the light and in no hurry to return to the bright, chaotic world above.\u0026nbsp• The trip was provided by Postojna Cave, which is open daily 9am-7pm from 3 June (summer hours), with baby olms in their new vivarium from 11 June.

Last Saturday, there were just 21.Across the three flights that took off, that means an average of seven passengers. Gatwick says that the figure – even lower than the 24 initially reported – is an outlier, but with a typical day currently falling anywhere between 100 and 400 passengers, the airport remains a ghost town.Just seven flights were scheduled at the airport on Tuesday, to and from Jersey, Dublin, Kingston, and Sofia. At about 2pm, in one major thoroughfare that normally bustles with passengers, staff and whiteboard-wielding cab drivers, there were six people, or one-fifth the number of hand sanitiser stations.Even stranger than the emptiness was the silence: with almost no passengers, the usually ubiquitous tannoy announcements had been muted completely.As the lockdown begins to lift, the desertion of Gatwick is a reminder of the vast challenges that remain for the aviation sector, with the announcement of a 14-day quarantine period from 8 June, and continuing advice to only travel when necessary, meaning that services will be restored at a glacial pace.\u0026nbspThe airport fears that the quarantine rules will have “a significant impact on our ability to restart”, a spokesperson said, adding that the airport would be lobbying for the guidelines to be regularly reviewed.In the meantime, a single branch of Boots is all that remains of the usually rich retail offer. There were no queues. “I’ve got no idea how long it’s been like this now, honestly,” a cashier said. “One day just merges into another.”\u0026nbspIn an even quieter corner, a man with no plans to travel was being told to stop using the free internet and go home. “If you come back within 24 hours you are liable to be arrested,” a bored-sounding police officer said. “You can’t just come here to get online.

She had been stranded after visiting home for Mother’s Day. “I kind of preferred being there,” she said, adding that the tiny propeller plane she had come back on had been packed, with no gaps between passengers but precautions including masks for all and no cabin service. “But with things starting to get more normal I had to come back for work.”\u0026nbspJason Harris was one of those headed the other way, having secured permission from the island’s immigration service and facing a coronavirus test on arrival, followed by two weeks in isolation if the result was positive.\u0026nbspA teacher who had been stranded on a trip back to his South Wales home, he was unable to delay his journey any longer if he was to be back in time for the restart of school.\u0026nbsp“When I left, there were 10 of us on the plane, the airport and the station were dead – it was quite upsetting,” he said. “I thought it would feel different coming back – but going through the station again today, and it was still dead – it was upsetting again.”Pharmacist Zahar Ali was going to Jersey from her home in Brighton, having volunteered to help fill an urgent staff shortage on the island.\u0026nbsp“I just thought … why not?” she said, as she smoked a cigarette next to the drop-off zone (one police car, three empty airport vehicles, nothing else). “It’ll be different. But it’s really strange being here, it’s normally so packed.”Although staff appear to heavily outnumber passengers, the underlying figures are devastating, says Unite regional officer Jamie Major.\u0026nbsp“So many businesses are dependent on the decisions the airlines take,” he said. “It’s a massive chain of dominos. For every plane taking off, it’s got to be cleaned, catered, ground-handled, the bags have to be screened – and it’s not happening.”The local area, where 36,000 jobs rely on the airport, is likewise in limbo. “The truth is you don’t really notice the flights one way or another when you’ve grown up around Crawley,” says the local Labour council leader, Peter Lamb. “But to some extent it’s a bit unnerving because it is so quiet. We all have friends and relatives who work in aviation.”While the area has been somewhat insulated from the airport’s struggles by the government’s furlough scheme, Lamb fears that many people are yet to understand the extent of the impact that lies ahead.\u0026nbsp“The big problem is that the public don’t think it’s going to happen,” he said. “I don’t think they’ve woken up to the reality that what’s been the most significant part of local industry isn’t going to be viable for a decade.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/821d7b535c6f8eb3ad718ef3b286522af2bc87f9/0_140_3104_1863/master/3104.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6e9c44a068756fb5c6cb5ccf5169408","title":"valencia criticise atalanta coach who attended match with covid 19","story":"Gian Piero Gasperini admits he had symptoms prior to Champions League match in Spain The Spanish football club Valencia has criticised\u0026nbspthe coach of Italian team Atalanta for “putting the health of numerous people at risk’’ after confessing he had symptoms of Covid-19 prior to the Champions League match between the two sides in March.In an interview with the Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport, Gian Piero Gasperini admitted he was very sick the day before the second leg match in Valencia on 10 March, which took place behind closed doors, but that he was afraid to go to a hospital as they were overflowing with Covid-19 patients at the time.Atalanta is based in Bergamo, one of the cities in Italy hardest hit by Covid-19. The first leg Champions League match between the two clubs, on 19 February, in Milan,\u0026nbspis thought to be among the main factors that contributed to an escalation of cases in Italy’s worst-affected province\u0026nbspand has been described as the\u0026nbsp“biological bomb”\u0026nbspthat turned the north of the country into the centre of the country’s outbreak.That day, about 40,000 football fans from Bergamo travelled the 30 miles (50km) to Milan’s San Siro stadium to watch Atalanta beat Valencia 4-1.“I was afraid,” Gaperini said. “The day before the match in Valencia I wasn’t well the afternoon of the match I felt even worse. The following two nights after the match, I didn’t sleep much. I didn’t have a fever, but I felt miserable, as if I had a fever of 40 degrees. Ambulances went by every two minutes. The hospital was nearby. I was as if we were at war. At night, I thought: ‘If I end up there, who knows what will happen to me?’ I can’t leave now, with so much to do …”“If you look at the pictures, I did not look good on the bench,” he added.An antibodies test carried out 10 days ago confirmed Gasperini had contracted the virus.In a statement on Monday, the Spanish club said: “Following the statements made by the Atalanta coach, Gian Piero Gasperini, Valencia FC wishes to publicly express its surprise over the fact that the coach of the rival team has admitted that he knew he apparently had symptoms compatible with the coronavirus on both the day of the match played in Mestalla – which Atalanta won 4-3 – and the day before. And yet he took no preventive measures, thereby potentially putting the health of numerous people at risk during both his journey to, and stay in, Valencia.”“It should be remembered,” it added, “that this game was played behind closed doors in accordance with the strict measures put in place by Spanish health authorities to prevent the risk of Covid-19 transmission, especially in the case of people coming from an area that had already been declared a public risk zone.”Italy has the third highest coronavirus death toll in the world, with more than 33,000 deaths.Gasperini said he self-isolated for three weeks at Atalanta’s training ground after the trip to Valencia and respected social distancing with his family.Like Italy, Spain has been particularly hard hit by the virus. To date, there have been 239,638 cases and 21,127 deaths.However, the country’s strict lockdown, which has been in force since 14 March, has succeeded in containing the virus. On Monday, Spain reported no Covid-19 deaths over the previous 24 hours for the first time since the beginning of March. The prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has said he will seek congress’s approval for a sixth and final extension of the state of emergency, which will expire on 21 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/252be9290a905b64ea94097b10aba896e598eb2e/0_307_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4077b3364c0db4753b45249af67c7265","title":"beijing draws up plans to outlaw criticism of traditional chinese medicine","story":"Draft legislation could lead to criminal prosecution for smearing medicinal approach backed by Xi JinpingAuthorities in Beijing are drafting legislation to outlaw criticism of traditional medicine in the Chinese capital.A notice published by health authorities called for public submissions on the draft, which would ban any inidual or organisation from making false or exaggerated claims about traditional Chinese medicine, or using it for illegitimate interests or to damage public interest.It would potentially lead to the criminal prosecution of people who criticise traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) or “cause trouble or disturb public order” by breaching the law.The move comes amid a broader campaign by China to promote TCM at home and abroad. In March state media said TCM therapies had been playing a “critical role” in the prevention and treatment of Covid-19, and some were sent to other nations as part of China’s international aid.China’s president Xi Jinping is a fervent supporter of TCM as a pillar of industry, and its potential to grow and develop.The draft and explanatory notes for the move in Beijing did not give details on what would constitute a smear against TCM. Submissions for public feedback are open until 28 June.The medical approach has evolved over thousands of years, and encompasses a broad range of treatments, including acupuncture, eating habits, and a range of drugs.According to a white paper by China’s state council published four years ago, the total value of the nation’s TCM industry was expected to reach $420bn by the end of this year.TCM has been the subject of several controversies, including the use of endangered animals by some practitioners.Last month the  reported the continued use of endangered animal parts, including from pangolins, tigers, leopards and rhinos, was endangering the reputation of the practice and industry.In November, European doctors called for tighter regulation after the World Health Organization (WHO) added a chapter on TCM to the International Classification of Diseases, which lists globally available medical treatments and influences government health budgets. The WHO said the addition was not an endorsement, but European scientists expressed concern it would be used for promotion of TCM.Additional reporting by Lillian Yang"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5655eaedb689bbd6c88b5466e921fa3e7771a23b/0_359_5411_3248/master/5411.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b5084f8f0c00ce647d660bb4ba0df0d","title":"britain could change immigration rules for hong kong citizens","story":"UK prime minister says all eligible for BNO passport can apply if China cuts freedomsBoris Johnson has opened the path to what he called one of the “biggest changes” to the British visa system, stating he was ready to offer a right to live and work in the UK to any of the nearly 3 million Hong Kong citizens eligible for a British National Overseas passport.Ministers have been ambivalent since last Thursday on whether the UK government’s offer of an extendable 12-month visa would be available only to the 350,000 current BNO passport holders in Hong Kong, or would also include the more than 2.5 million eligible to apply for the passport.In the Commons on Tuesday, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, implied the offer was  available only to the narrower group, stressing the government needed to be realistic about what it could offer. However, writing in the Times on Wednesday,, Johnson appeared to make a far wider offer to all those eligible to hold a BNO passport.The prime minister’s offer would come into play only if China presses ahead with new security laws that strip Hong Kong of its traditional freedoms.Johnson wrote in the Times that if the security laws were pursued, “Britain would have no choice but to uphold our profound ties of history and friendship with the people of Hong Kong”.He said: “Today about 350,000 people hold British Nationals (Overseas) passports and another 2.5 million people would be eligible to apply for them. At present these passports allow for visa free access for up to six months.“If China imposes its national security law, the British government will change its immigration rules and allow any holder of these passports from Hong Kong to come to the UK for a renewable period of 12 months and be given further immigration rights including the right to work which would place them on the route to citizenship.”He added: “This would amount to one of the biggest changes to our visa system in history. If it proves necessary Britain will take this step and take it willingly.”In the Commons, Raab seemed more circumspect, saying: “We have said that we will allow the 300,000-plus passport holders, along with their dependants, to come to the UK in the way I described.”It is not known how many of these eligible for a BNO passport would apply, but Raab said in the event of a mass exodus he would hope the burden would be shared internationally.The ambiguity in the UK government position about the precise extent of its offer to Hong Kong citizens, and the pathway to citizenship, may reflect differences within the cabinet.\u0026nbspIt could also reflect a British desire to leave China guessing about the potential scale of a British-enabled brain drain from Hong Kong, if Beijing seeks to suppress human rights in the territory.Johnson also used his article to make a final appeal to China to reconsider its actions, urging the leaders in Beijing to realise that with power came the need for magnanimity.He wrote: “Britain does not seek to prevent China’s rise on the contrary we will work side by side on all the issues where our interests converge, from trade to climate change. We want a modern and mature relationship, based on mutual respect and recognising China’s place in the world.“And it is precisely because we welcome China as a leading member of the world community that we expect it to abide by international agreements.”Martin Lee, a barrister, former legislator and co-drafter of the basic law, said the offers by foreign governments to help people from Hong Kong people were generous, but not enough.“Because no matter how generous you are in the provision of passports and so on, there are still large numbers of people who are not eligible for one reason or another,” Lee told the .This included young people who protested over the past year, more than 8,000 of whom were arrested and feared further charges under the national security laws.“So I want more, and I want the international community to put their heads together and come up with a multinational sustainable solution for Hong Kong.”He said Beijing had clearly breached its treaty obligations. The then Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping had made great efforts in 1997 to have the declaration supported by the international community and registered in the United Nations, Lee said, precisely to ensure Hong Kong’s elite residents and businesses did not flee. “When I say I want them to do more I mean hold China to the original policy.” Johnson’s article was welcomed as a “remarkable intervention” by Johnny Patterson, director of the human rights NGO Hong Kong Watch. He said: “It is a watershed moment in Sino-British relations.\u0026nbspNo sitting PM has made a statement as bold as this on Hong Kong since the handover.“It reflects two things, first the severity of the situation on the ground, and second the fact that the British government genuinely, and rightly, feel a sense of duty to citizens of Hong Kong and are going to do all they can to stop them becoming the collateral\u0026nbspdamage of escalating geopolitical tensions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c289b5915476567fe00fb9fcff95cc57818457a2/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=3975118e47b36622b46c12fb6456f569","title":"coronavirus lockdown rules what is allowed in england scotland wales and northern ireland","story":"From socialising to sports, everything you need to know about the latest lockdown dos and don’tsThe latest coronavirus rules, from Monday 1 June, are plentiful and complicated. This is your ultimate guide.Q. Can I visit other people’s homes?You can spend time in private gardens or other outdoor spaces in groups of six from different households if you live in England or Northern Ireland – but you must adhere to 2-metre distancing. Those considered clinically extremely vulnerable can meet one person from outside their household if they live alone.Bring your own chairs and wipe them down carefully with household cleaner before and after use. You can go inside the property only for the purpose of accessing the garden or outdoor space.In Scotland, two households can meet outdoors, in groups no larger than eight, or visit close family in their gardens,\u0026nbspwith people urged to stay local and distance at all times. In Wales, two households can meet but should avoid travelling more than five miles.Q. Can I use the lavatory?Yes, but avoid touching surfaces, wash your hands thoroughly, wipe down surfaces and use separate towels, or paper ones.Q. Can I stay away from home?You cannot stay overnight away from your home except for in a limited set of circumstances, such as for work.Q. Should I wear a mask or visor and when?The UK government advises people to wear a face covering in enclosed spaces, such as on public transport and in shops, or anywhere that physical distancing is not always possible. The Scottish government has urged people to wear face coverings in all shops.While evidence suggests that wearing a face covering does not entirely protect you, it is likely to prevent others from becoming infected – especially important if you have not yet developed symptoms and are not self-isolating.Conversely, scientists say it is possible that visors protect the wearer but not those around them. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200601-73293-20200602_tif_DavidHunterRnumber.mp3 Q. Who should not wear a face covering?Face coverings should not be used by under-twos or those who may find it difficult to manage them correctly, such as unassisted primary-age children or those with respiratory conditions.Q. Does it matter what type of mask I wear?Different types of face covering offer different levels of protection, with surgical grade N95 respirators offering the highest, followed by surgical grade masks. However, these are costly, in limited supply and contribute to landfill waste. Even countries that have required the public to wear face masks have generally suggested surgical masks be reserved for health workers and those at high risk. You can make your own face covering, or use a scarf, shawl, or old T-shirt.Q. What shops can I visit?Essential outlets, which range from supermarkets to homeware shops, have remained open and car showrooms and outdoor markets opened on Monday in England.High street shops in the non-essential category will reopen in England from 15 June if the government’s five tests for coping with the virus are met, and provided that the shops are “Covid-secure”. Shops that expect to open from 15 June include those selling clothes, shoes, toys, furniture, books and electronics, plus tailors, auction houses, photography studios and indoor markets. Welsh high streets may open later than in England, while Scottish retailers will open on a phased basis, based on monitoring of the virus.Hairdressers, nail bars and beauty salons, cafes, pubs and other hospitality venues. While no dates have been given, the UK government has said they will reopen on a phased basis.Q. When can I get my hair cut and go to a pub?Ministers have an “ambition” to\u0026nbspopen at least some remaining businesses such as hairdressers and beauty salons, restaurants and pubs, but it will be no earlier than 4 July in England, and subject to the government’s five tests.Q. Who can go to work?Employers should make “every effort” to support working from home, according to the government in advice for England, but anyone who cannot do so is expected to return to work if it is safe.Q. What provisions are in place in workplaces?Government guidance emphasises that the risk of transmission can be lowered by reducing the number of people workers come into contact with and avoiding face-to-face meetings.Employers can support this by changing shift patterns and rotas, and splitting people into smaller, contained teams. Workers should avoid sharing equipment.Primary schools in England have been asked to bring back reception, year 1 and year 6 classes, as well as nursery children, from 1 June. In secondary schools, year 10 and 12 pupils are due to have some face-to-face time with teachers before the end of the summer term.The government’s “hope” is that all other primary children in England will return to school before the summer break. Secondary school pupils will not return before September.In Scotland,\u0026nbspteachers can return to prepare for\u0026nbspthe start of the new school year on 11 August,\u0026nbspwhen pupils will begin a “blended” model of at-home and in-school learning. Childminding services and fully outdoor nurseries are reopening while some councils are allowing older primary school pupils to begin the transition to secondary school.In Wales, education authorities are to announce plans on Wednesday. Some pupils in Northern Ireland will return to school in late August, with a phased return for the remainder.Amid concerns from unions and some parents, the UK government’s\u0026nbspguidance on reopening schools\u0026nbspstates that constant physical distancing of 2-metres is, in effect, impossible in schools.Its recommendations emphasise the importance of regular handwashing and cleaning of surfaces, and maintaining distance as much as possible, for example with different classroom layouts and staggered break times.\u0026nbspQ. How far can I travel?While people in England and Northern Ireland can travel as far as they want to take exercise and spend time outside, those in Wales are being asked to stay about 5 miles from their homes. Guidelines in Scotland require people to stay within 5 miles except when visiting close family.Q. When, where and how can I travel?Reduce demand on the public transport network by walking or cycling wherever possible, or driving, and by reducing trips. Use less busy routes where possible.Q. Can I share a car with someone else?Taxi services are operating, subject to advice such as passengers sitting in the back left-hand seat if travelling alone. Those who have to share private cars with people outside of their household group have been advised to keep to the same small groups.Q. Can I travel within the UK and go abroad?The UK government advises against all but essential travel abroad. People in England can now go as far as they want for exercise.Despite an easing of lockdowns around the UK, people are advised not to travel between Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland.Q. What sports can I do and where?Basketball and tennis courts, bowling greens and golf courses are open in England. Physical distancing must apply, with no more than five other people from outside one’s household allowed to take part.In Scotland, outdoor activities such as golf, bowls, tennis and fishing have restarted, with distancing caveats, while in Northern Ireland outdoor activities and sports including golf, water sports, tennis and those that don’t involve shared contact with hard surfaces are permitted.Outdoor gyms, playgrounds and outdoor and indoor swimming pools remain closed, though there are plans for pools to reopen, possibly without changing rooms.Q. Are professional sports people treated differently?Yes. Elite athletes, as defined by specific\u0026nbspguidance, can train and compete using specified gyms, pools and sports facilities. In Wales, only golfers and professional footballers have been allowed to play again.* Key workers and those needing access to childcare have not been subject to the same lockdown rules as others."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb74dc9466f05f06cc65ec010314864589cfdf97/0_194_3402_2042/master/3402.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac49751db60efac4011b093d0ccf5821","title":"cyclone nisarga india evacuates 100000 as mumbai braces for historic storm","story":"First cyclone in 70 years for financial capital sparks rush to transfer Covid-19 patients and sanitise temporary sheltersAt least 100,000 people including coronavirus patients were being moved to safety as India’s west coast braced for a cyclone – the first such storm to threaten Mumbai in more than 70 years.Authorities in India’s financial capital, which is struggling to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, evacuated nearly 150 virus patients from a recently built field hospital to a facility with a concrete roof as a precautionary measure, officials said on Tuesday.The chief minister of Maharashtra state, Uddhav Thackeray, of which Mumbai is the capital, said people living in flimsy homes near the shore were being moved to safer places before Cyclone Nisarga made its scheduled landfall later on Wednesday.“Slum-dwellers … in low-lying areas have been instructed to evacuate,” Thackeray’s office wrote on social media.The temporary Covid-19 hospitalwas erected in a few weeks and is said to be able to withstand speeds of up to 80kph but not the expected wind speeds of over 100kph.  Extra generators have been delivered to hospitals in the past few days. “Everything we didn’t want to happen right now is happening,” one city official told a TV channel.While the poor and homeless are watching cyclone’s approach with dread, so are the city’s rich and famous who have holiday homes in the neighbourhood of Alibaug, where it is expected to make landfall. Alibaug is Mumbai’s answer to Martha’s Vineyard – a weekend getaway that is only a 15 minute speedboat ride away from the city and offers quiet beaches and solitude. Luxurious villas, set amid coconut groves right on the beach, lie directly in the path of the cyclone. In Maharashtra’s Palghar district more than 21,000 villagers were being evacuated, local media reported, citing officials.Mumbai has rarely faced the brunt of cyclones. The last severe storm to hit the city struck in 1948, killing 12 people and injuring more than 100.Indian meteorologists have warned of heavy rainfall, with winds of 100-110kmh (60-70mph) and gusts of up to 120kmh capable of damaging thatched huts and power lines. Storm surges of one to two metres (3-6ft) could inundate low-lying areas of Maharashtra.Nisarga was also expected to hit the neighbouring state of Gujarat with nearly 79,000 people to be evacuated from coastal regions by Wednesday morning, the Gujarat relief commissioner Harshad Patel said.Patel said 18 districts across the state would experience heavy rainfall and strong winds of up to 110kmh.“In wake of the coronavirus outbreak all standard operating procedures are being followed at the temporary shelters which have been sanitised and instructions have been issued on following safe distancing,” said Arpit Sagar, an official in Valsad.Nisarga comes on the heels of Cyclone Amphan which killed more than 100 people when it hit eastern India and Bangladesh in May, flattening villages, destroying farms and leaving millions without electricity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/470a767b160feadf996109b56b33dec88b2a61ed/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=190b7200659088eefc346dbf1631c754","title":"global report asian markets at three month high on hope of covid 19 recovery","story":"Australia in recession record deaths in Brazil Zoom makes $27m profit in one quarter South Korea announces huge stimulusStock markets in Asia have risen to their highest level for almost three months on the back of renewed optimism that the global economy will recover strongly from the coronavirus crisis.

The situation also worsened elsewhere in Latin America.After shares on Wall Street shrugged off another night of unrest on the streets of American cities to post a third straight day of gains, markets soared upwards from Seoul to Sydney and Tokyo to Hong Kong.

The objectives include the creation of 550,000 jobs and providing “emergency funds” to business owners.The virus has infected 6.37 million people globally and more than 380,000 have died, according to the latest figures from Johns Hopkins University.Brazil registered 28,936 additional cases of the novel coronavirus in the 24 hours to Tuesday evening, the ministry said, and 1,262 deaths. There are now 555,383 total confirmed coronavirus cases in Brazil and 31,199 coronavirus deaths.\u0026nbspIt is the second worst affected country behind the United States.The fresh record came as the rightwing president, Jair Bolsonaro, continued to belittle the threat of the virus, warning that the economic fallout from quarantine measures would be worse than the pandemic itself.\u0026nbsp“I regret each of the deaths but that’s everyone’s destiny,” Bolsonaro told supporters outside his palace in the capital, Brasília.Brazil’s most populous state, São Paulo, registered a record number of deaths on Tuesday taking the total number of fatalities there to nearly 8,000.

Police reinforcements would arrive soon, he added.Just hours after the governor left the town, 20km from Nigeria’s northern border with Niger, more than 70 people were killed in five villages in the district. The brutal details of the massacre, which took place on 26 May, mirror countless similar attacks by suspected “bandits”\u0026nbspacross north-western Nigeria and increasingly, southern Niger.A hoard of more than 100 heavily armed assailants on motorbikes, from camps in the nearby Isah forest, stormed towards the villages, gunning down residents and destroying property, eyewitnesses said.\u0026nbspDesperate villagers called the local police but, as is common when heavily armed attacks are imminent, no one arrived.“I am in shock seeing these bodies, we’ve recovered 74 corpses,” said Lawali Kakale Gobir, who lives in a nearby village.\u0026nbspIncessant killings by criminal groups – referred to locally as bandits – are rupturing rural life in one of the poorest parts of the world.\u0026nbspThe specific motives for the killings in Sabon Birni are unclear, but the underlying causes fuelling massacres across the region are glaring.For more than a decade, the area has suffered from incidents of armed robbery and cattle rustling, but as competition for land and resources between ethnic Fulani herders and local farmers has intensified, attacks have become more frequent and more violent. Although “banditry” encompasses a range of criminal activity conducted along various non-ethnic and ethnic factors, many of the recent large-scale armed attacks have been carried out by suspected Fulani assailants.\u0026nbspMany Fulanis – nomadic pastoralists who  west Africa – face the twin threat of climate change and rapid population growth, both of which have diminished available land.In Nigeria, herders are encroaching on private landmore frequently as grazing reserves disappear.\u0026nbspAs such, historically muted disputes between Fulani pastoralists and farmers of various ethnicities over land resources have rapidly intensified.“There is a long history of Fulbe (Fulani) and Hausa people living peacefully and having strong friendships and business ties,” said Chitra Nagarajan, a conflict researcher in Nigeria. “However, many Fulbe people, particularly in more rural areas, have felt not only completely marginalised from government interventions but that policies and programmes, for example the selling of grazing land, have reduced their livelihoods.”Hausas think Fulani grievances are unfounded and given disproportionate attention, she said.\u0026nbspWidespread poverty has heightened the appeal of armed criminality as a way of life. Kidnappings for ransom have become commonplace. Pastoralist life faces threats around the world, but in Nigeria the violence has been catalysed by poverty, a failure of local justice and ethnic isions.Almost 70,000 people have fled north-west Nigeria to Niger since April 2019, including 30,000 in the last two months. According to the International Crisis Group, 11,000 people have died since 2011. Many deaths, particularly in Fulani communities, go unreported.\u0026nbspSeveral army operations have been launched, but most have been largely ineffective.\u0026nbspState governments in the region have resorted to signing controversial and secretive peace agreements with bandits and vigilantes to stop the killings. But the deals soon unravel.According to Selim Meddeb Hamrouni, a reporting officer at the UNHCR refugee agency in Maradi in south-west Niger, the armed groups have grown more active there, spreading north from Nigeria.“This 20km band inside the Nigerien border is where we’re seeing attacks happening time and again,” Hamrouni\u0026nbspsaid.The UNHCR is moving refugees in Niger into towns further inside the country. Niger is already struggling to contain jihadist violence on its soil, and is overburdened with refugees from surrounding countries and internal displacement.Bandit attacks have forced a steady exodus from areas such as Sabon Birni, said Abdu Dan Ige, a 40-year-old health worker.\u0026nbspHis village had been peaceful for all his life but is now restless. “We cannot hold even wedding ceremonies without bribing the bandits for them to allow the social events to be held without violence,” he said. “Hardly a day passes without a village being attacked.”Nigeria’s response is compromised by the decade-long war with jihadists in the north-east. With security forces stretched, armed groups have been able to operate with little resistance in the north-west.Murtala Rufa’i, a politics and security researcher in Sokoto, said the vast, mineral-rich forests that stretch across northern Nigeria into Niger and the Sahel have become a haven for the groups.“The forests are vital,” said Rufa’i. “It is vast and not well understood except by the groups that use them, particularly Fulanis because of their pastoralist roots. They’ve used forest tracks to import caches of heavy weapons.”Nigeria’s north-west and its porous border with Niger is gradually reconfiguring into a nexus for armed groups, he said. In many cases the groups are becoming more heavily armed than local police forces.\u0026nbspA growing concern is that jihadists fleeing pressure in the north-east and coming south from Niger could establish roots in the north-west.“We’ve seen some jihadist elements try to establish connections with bandit groups,” Rufa’i said. “They’ve so far been unsuccessful but jihadists could see the region as ripe for gaining a foothold and exploiting local grievances.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Taoiseach tells FG parliamentary party it may be next week before deal is finalisedUnions call for Government to lay out \u0026lsquoclear roadmap\u0026rsquo of just transition from peat productionUnthinkable: Conceivable Future is fostering a personal but \u0026lsquodeeply political\u0026rsquo debate"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteriaAs top marine predators, dolphins accumulate the most man-made toxic pollutants"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Eight further deaths and 10 new cases of Covid-19 have been reported in the State.

Photograph: Colin Keegan Collins DublinA further eight deaths of people diagnosed with Covid-19 have been reported by the National Public Health Emergency team. This brings to 1,658 the number of deaths in the Republic.Some 10 new laboratory confirmed cases were reported by NPHET on Tuesday, bringing the total number of cases to 25,066.While this is the lowest daily figure since March 11th, Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan cautioned against “over-interpretation” of the figure due to the bank holiday weekend.Dr Holohan said the Black Lives Matter protest in Dublin attended by thousands of people at the weekend posed “a risk to life”.Now was “not the time” to organise or attend such mass gatherings due to the risk of transmitting Covid-19, he said.People should follow public health advice and exercise their judgement on “impromptu” mass gatherings, he said.“We have no public health advice on protest our advice is on gatherings,” he told the NPHET briefing on Tuesday.Mass gatherings were banned in March as part of the restrictions imposed by the Government to curb the spread of coronavirus.Community casesOf the approximately 500 new cases over the past week, about half occurred in that week, and about half of these were not linked to known clusters in care facilities, meat plants or other locations.This means about quarter of new cases are arising in the community with no known link to other cases.Dr Holohan said 54 per cent of last week’s cases involved people aged between 24-55 years, and were spread across 21 counties in Ireland.“While we are doing well, the potential for spread remains present across all regions of the country,” he said. “NPHET will meet on Thursday and submit further recommendations to Government for consideration.”Almost half of people tested are taking longer than four days from onset of symptoms to being swabbed, according to deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn, who urged people to know the symptoms of Covid-19 and get medical attention as soon as they appear.Asked whether the wearing of face-masks should be made mandatory, Dr Holohan said the evidence for this approach was not strong enough.Of those who have died, 1,493 had underlying conditions 819 were male and 866 were female.There were 36 patients with Covid-19 in intensive care on Tuesday morning, down from a high of 160 at the peak of the epidemic.The number of clusters of the disease in residential care facilities increased by four since Friday, to 472 of these, 258, an increase of one, were in nursing homes.A total of 1,049 people have died in residential care facilities, including 917 in nursing homes.To date, 348,416 tests have been carried out, including 22,621 in the past week - barely one-fifth of available capacity. Just 1.7 per cent were positive.Tough measuresEarlier the Government urged people to stick with ‘tough’ measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus so that some restrictions can be eased as planned on June 8th.At the Government’s morning Covid-19 briefing on Tuesday, assistant secretary general at the Department of Taoiseach Liz Canavan said people should continue adhering to travel and social distancing guidelines. She asked people to “keep it up for a few more days”.“We know it has been tough. However as we approach the end of phase one of the roadmap, we can see that the efforts everyone has made are continuing to benefit our communities. Hopefully that gives us a very good chance of moving to phase two as scheduled,” Ms Canavan said.In phase two, which is due begin next Monday, the 5km restriction on movement will be widened to 20km but unnecessary journeys should still be avoided.Visits to homes of over 70s and medically vulnerable will be allowed by no more than a small number of people for a short period of time.Up to four people may visit another household for a short period while maintaining strict social distancing.Ms Canavan said it was clear that many people did not travel outside their locality over the Bank Holiday weekend.Meanwhile, the number of people claiming the Government’s special weekly pandemic payment has dropped by 36,000 since last week as more people return to employment.Ms Canavan said there are now 543,000 unemployed recipients of the weekly €350 payment.The overall value of the weekly payments is now around €190 million.Ms Canavan also said Irish Water is urging the public to conserve water after an increase in water usage in the past week and over the Bank Holiday weekend.“First of all I must emphasise that we all have to prioritise hand-washing but Irish Water is today again appealing to the public and to businesses to make every effort to conserve water by discontinuing non-essential usage such as the operation of power-washers, by using a watering can rather than a hose in the garden, by taking showers over a bath and by fixing any dripping taps were it is possible to do so.”She said it was “very likely” that a hosepipe ban would be needed.“It is now very likely that a water conservation order, what we know as a hosepipe ban, will be necessary to conserve water supplies as demand for water continues to soar and the drought conditions continue.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Figure in international scout movement says Irish policies among best in world for decadesMove aims to pave way for planned \u0026euro15m renovation and extension of \u0026lsquoDead Zoo\u0026rsquoRapid serological tests could undermine public health response to crisis, report warnsHolohan says \u0026lsquowe\u0026rsquore in a good position\u0026rsquo for second phase of reopening to proceedTaoiseach tells FG parliamentary party it may be next week before deal is finalisedClimate expert urges Irish Water to fix decaying system to ease pressure on supplySince April, almost 200 online hearings have taken place as their style and form evolve\u0026lsquoI\u0026rsquom literally shaking,\u0026rsquo man tells judge, as he thanks himCases heard by judge sitting in physical courtroom while other parties use videolinkIrish Youth Foundation (IYF) survey show concerns about long-term impact on youthTaoiseach understood to have told TDs Fine Gael will not enter government \u0027at all costs\u0027Council maintenance crews investigate incident in south Dublin villageArlene Foster wants vote to send message to British government of Stormont\u0026rsquos rejection of abortion law enacted at Westminster\u0026lsquoAlmost two months I was stuck.

Photograph: Eric Luke Some Ministers and senior officials, as well as Opposition politicians involved in the process, privately warn that talks will have to be concluded by next week at the latest. They point to the need to pass votes in the Dáil and Seanad before June 30th or key sections of the Offences Against the State Act – the anti-terrorist and organised crime legislation that governs, among other things, the Special Criminal Court – will lapse. The Act must be reviewed every year and its extension approved by votes in the Oireachtas. Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan is expected to bring the annual review to the Oireachtas next week.Party insiders say it could take up to two weeks for the parties to gain approval from their memberships (which could, of course, decide to reject any deal). If an agreement on a programme for government were to be reached this day next week, that would leave one week at the end of June for the election of a new taoiseach by the Dáil, the nomination of ministers and the passing of the votes on the Offences Against the State Act. In other words, not much wriggle room.Separately, Green Party deputy leader Catherine Martin must decide by this weekend if she will let her name go forward to challenge Eamon Ryan for the leadership of the Green Party. Martin – who is heading the Green negotiating team at the talks – has been approached by some party activists who want her to stand against Ryan, and has said she will consider her options. A contest would not take place until after the conclusion of the government-formation process, one way or another.But what are the chances of agreeing a deal by next week? Insiders vary in their assessments of progress thus far, but while it is clear that significant progress has been made – and agreed documents on a range of policy issues were due to be signed off by the teams on Tuesday night – there are a number of areas where agreement has not yet been reached. STICKING POINTS: SEVEN KEY DIFFERENCES IN THE TALKS The 7 per cent targetThis is the key policy for the Greens, and insiders say the programme will contain a commitment to reduce Ireland’s emissions of greenhouses gases by an average of 7 per cent a year. The Greens have pressed on how exactly this would be achieved and measured, where sticking points remain.TransportplanningThis includes a contentious review of the National Development Plan. The Greens are sticking to the requirement to have 10 per cent of the transport budget set aside for cycling and 10 per cent for walking, though have conceded that the budget for roads maintenance should be preserved as a road safety measure.Housing There are major differences on the Land Development Agency, the State body with the remit to develop State lands for housing. The Greens believe such lands should be developed by the State for public housing and oppose lands being sold to private developers. AgricultureFine Gael and Fianna Fáil’s rural constituencies are wary of the Greens’ influence in this area, and some of the Green proposals have proved particularly problematic – including a requirement that targets be set for the number of hectares of bog to be “rewetted”.State pension age This is primarily a dispute between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. The State pension age is due to increase to 67 next year, and Fianna Fáil says the planned rise should not go ahead and has called for a review of pension policy. It is understood this would also take a wider look at the PRSI system. Fine Gael insists that deferring the eligibility age must go ahead, claiming it would not be prudent to abandon it. It believes transition welfare payments should apply until someone reaches 67. Legislation that would ban forcing people to retire at 65 is also being discussed. Budget and economic issuesA session on finance and economic issues over the weekend is said to have been difficult. Green finance spokeswoman Neasa Hourigan sought details on budgetary measures that could be introduced in next autumn’s budget, but both Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and Fianna Fáil finance spokesman Michael McGrath pushed back, insisting it was impossible to predict the economic conditions that far ahead given the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Underpinning the parties’ differences, however, are the fears of some Green TDs that the Government will be forced – or choose – to introduce cuts to public spending or tax increases, and that they will be pilloried by critics on the left, especially Sinn Féin, for supporting “austerity”. Fine Gael is also understood to be pushing for a broad commitment to income tax cuts at some point during the government’s term of office if circumstances allow, but Fianna Fáil and the Greens are not keen, with some arguing that such a pledge may never be delivered upon. Direct provision Ending the direct provision system is a key demand of the Greens and a cherished goal of the party membership. Green Party figures say they want an immediate overhaul of the system in advance of it being scrapped entirely, with responsibility for housing those waiting on asylum decisions being passed to Approved Housing Bodies. Green sources are impatient with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael arguments for a phasing out of the direct provision system over a number of years.Catherine Day, a former secretary general of the European Commission, is due to report back to the government later this year on the future of direct provision. Her report is cited by those in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael but the Greens are suspicious of claims that it would take years to abolish the current system.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4268752.1591111892!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"luke ming flanagan bares his bottom half to european parliament","story":" MEP Luke Ming Flanagan lived out a remote working nightmare by participating in a European Parliament committee meeting on agriculture in a state of undress.

Obviously at all times we should be trying to get the maximum bang for our buck, “ Mr Flanagan told the committee from the bed as he rubbed his bare legs, apparently unaware the camera was showing his bottom half.“In countries like Ireland where people are on smaller payments these farmers are even suffering further,” he continued, in reference to European Union CAP subsidies for farmers.The interpreters who were live translating his words into various European languages could be heard fighting back laughter as Mr Flanagan spoke.Following the contribution, committee chair MEP Norbert Lins grinned as he thanked Mr Flanagan for his words.The representative for Midlands-North-West laughed off the incident on social media, saying he had just returned from a run. “Was in a T-shirt two minutes before. Decided to put on shirt to look respectable! That worked really well,” Mr Flanagan wrote on Twitter. He told The  he was doing most of his meetings from the bedroom in his house in Roscommon as it is “the handiest place to work from” with his wife and children also at home.“I wasn’t that bothered to be quite honest,” Mr. Flanagan said of his appearance. “What’s in a pair of legs at the end of the day?”The European Parliament has set up a remote voting system to keep working throughout the pandemic, with MEPs able to cast ballots via email and participate in debates over video link.

If there were cheaper beds out there, we could have got them, but there weren’t.” Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill “Well, I wouldn’t start from here anyways.” That old joke about the farmer’s response to a tourist looking for directions came to mind when the Department of Health’s head honcho appeared at Tuesday’s meeting of the Covid Committee. Members wanted to hear all the details surrounding the “arrangement” between Jim Breslin’s department and the private hospitals which saw the temporary abandonment of our two-tier medical system as private beds were brought into the public hospital sector. But Breslin wasn’t laughing. With hindsight, he accepted there are aspects of the deal which his department might revisit when – nobody at the meeting was suggesting there might be an “if” – the second surge of the virus hits. But it’s easy after the event to take a more informed approach the next time and easier for politicians who weren’t confronted by the urgent necessity to secure critical hospital beds at short notice to ask searching questions about how this was achieved. There was a general view that the reason these private beds weren’t needed in the end was down to good luck, he said. They had been acquired “if Covid-19 took us to the place none of us wanted to go”. That journey didn’t happen, despite the woefully inadequate number of intensive care beds in the public system before anybody even knew of the existence of coronavirus. “But we are all a bit Irish, because we got through this and we look back and say ‘Oh, we must have been lucky’. We weren’t lucky with the amount of capacity we have. We knew on ICU that we had less than the international norms. We knew in other things that we were short, but yet we got through it and I think it’s worth asking the question: how come we have managed?” The secretary general pointed to the quality of staff here, the performance of people at the front line and the commitment from people in the health service. “I might even mention the department, I might mention the Oireachtas. We did manage to do something right.” He needed to get that off his chest. Bed shamblesBut we have entered strange territory when the man in charge of the Department of Health relies on the hospital beds shambles it presided over before the pandemic stuck to demonstrate just how well it responded to this particular crisis. All the witnesses appeared via video-link. But it was uneventful. All were wearing their full complement of clothes and there wasn’t as much as a bare ankle or hairy knee on show. The appearance of MEP Ming the Trouserless at a different committee meeting on Tuesday was far more entertaining. He made Roscommon the newest European fleshpot when contributing remotely to a meeting while unaware that the camera shot showed him sitting in his underwear. There’s an idea to liven things up in Leinster House, where video-links are now a thing. The two Sinn Féin TDs, David Cullinane and Louise O’Reilly, took the toughest line of the committee members present in the chamber. They were very concerned about the high cost of covering all the private beds in the country for the three-month emergency. Cullinane was like a terrier, snapping at the civil servant, hurrying him along, interrupting replies. The Waterford TD said less than half of the private beds were used. How much capacity did they think they needed? At the start, looking at what was happening in countries like Italy, “we considered we would probably need it all, and more besides”. So they negotiated a deal on the basis they would be using the full capacity in private hospitals?Used-car salesmanThe senior civil servant gave a classic senior civil servant’s answer: “We anticipated we potentially might.” Cullinane was not happy with the deal. “There were no other beds on the island that we could get access to . . . If there were cheaper beds out there, we could have got them, but there weren’t,” said Breslin. The Sinn Féin deputy then drew on his own expertise in the private sector. It seems he was once a used-car salesman. “I worked in the car sales industry at one point and I can tell you I would love to see people like you coming through the door if I was selling a used car.” Having heard the details, a cost of €300 million didn’t strike him as a good outcome, given there was no costbenefit analysis and less than half of the beds were used. Breslin bit back. “I’ll tell you what that sounds like to me: that sounds like a fire alarm went off and we sent four fire tenders to put out the fire and people are now saying we only should have sent three. I am very happy that we sent four fire tenders because what if it needed more than three?” Those four fire engines zig-zagged in and out of the exchanges for the rest of the session. “We were delighted that four fire engines were sent to deal with the crisis rather than three,” said Labour’s Duncan Smith. Róisín Shortall of the Social Democrat’s agreed with his comments. Fine Gael’s Colm Brophy thought some questions sounded like a case of “classic Monday morning quarterbacking”, a term used to describe people who criticise and offer alternative solutions after the event. As for the fire engines? “They were well-needed and well-wanted. I wouldn’t send any of them away early, that risk should never be taken.” Waterford Independent Matt Shanahan had a different take. He agreed it was right to dispatch four fire tenders “but I would also say that pretty soon we discovered that two fire tenders had the fire under control. We could have sent those other tenders off to treat fires elsewhere.” Sinn Féin’s Louise O’Reilly had the last word: “If we wanted a complete picture of that we could say that the conditions were created in advance for the fire to get out of control.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4269096.1591131880!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"programme for government must include fiscal responsibility varadkar","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVaradkar raised the prospect of a cross-party effort to appoint senators to pass legislation if government formation talks had not concluded. File photograph: Crispin RodwellThe Fine Gael will not enter government “at all costs” and must see fiscal responsibility at the centre of any deal, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has told his TDs. A meeting of the Fine Gael parliamentary party, held remotely, also heard Mr Varadkar raise the prospect of cross-party efforts to appoint senators to pass legislation if government-formation talks had not concluded.Sections of emergency anti-terrorist and anti-crime gang legislation are set to lapse if a new government is not formed by the end of June because the Seanad is not in session.The provisions of the Offences against the State Act and the Criminal Justice Amendment Act 2009 are renewed each year by the end of June through a motion of both the Dáil and the Seanad.If the laws are not renewed by June 30th, then non-jury trials for certain offences will not be allowed. These include offences relating both to paramilitary and gang crimes, such as directing the activities of a criminal organisation or training in firearms.A number of provisions on evidence will also lapse including the extra powers given to gardaí to allow them to make inferences from an accused person’s silence.The measures will not be renewed because the Seanad is in abeyance until a new government is formed. Only 49 members of the 60-seat Seanad have been elected. The remaining 11 are chosen by the incoming taoiseach. Mr Varadkar is not empowered to nominate them.Senator Sean Kyne asked Mr Varadkar about this, and said it would be a shame if this was allowed lapse under Fine Gael. Mr Varadkar is understood to have responded that efforts would still be made to ensure that did not happen, such seeking “cross-party” approval to appoint 11 senators, even if such efforts are unsuccessful.Other parties immediately poured cold water on the idea, with one well-placed source arguing that a taoiseach has to be elected by the Dáil first. Both Mr Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney said that any programme for government must reflect Fine Gael values, citing fiscal responsibility and the deficit.

A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"have starved supermarkets behaved like schools","story":"A temperature check on the way in, and another one somewhere between the fish and cheese counter. Staff in full protective gear. Hand sanitisers and wipes on the corner of every aisle, and a system for shipping every packet of crisps off to the lab to make sure the packaging doesn’t have traces of the virus. Oh, and a pay rise for anyone coming into work, along with consultations on targets for gender and racial equality.If the supermarkets had imposed the same sort of restrictions on staying open through this epidemic as local authorities, Whitehall mandarins, and the teaching unions have imposed on schools we would all have starved by the middle of April.True, schools are not quite the same as grocery shops. Different rules and standards sometimes apply. And yet in truth, education is every bit as essential as food, and the logistical challenges are no more complex. Both teachers and the educational bureaucracy should learn some lessons in flexibility and adaptability from the private sector. At the risk of sounding like an especially platitudinous headmaster on speech day, challenges can be overcome, and difficulties surmounted, but only if everyone works together – and there sure isn’t much sign of that in the education system right now.Anyone who has been to a supermarket in the last month will have noticed how the big chains have adapted to a virus which, while infectious, is not completely deadly. One-way systems have been introduced, along with limits on the numbers of customers in the store at any one time, masks for staff, and cashless payment. It’s not just the supermarkets either: my local farm shop operated on a list system: tell them at the door what you wanted, and they packed a box for you. It is different. And it costs money. But the important point is this. Both the big chains and the local shops have adapted, and come up with something that works. The shelves are full. We can eat.The schools are very different. From Monday, primary schools were meant to finally reopen their doors to limited year groups. The aspiration was for all primary schools pupils to be able to spend a month in class before the summer holidays. But so far, things have been chaotic. Some areas have hardly any classes operating at all. In others, teachers are refusing to go back. Anxious parents and still more anxious five-year olds are confronted with a bewildering set of restrictions that threaten to rip out the soul of what a school should be.Many of the rules vary between the deranged and the slightly sinister. Do small children really need to be temperature-checked on the way in when there is so little evidence they carry Covid-19? Has whoever came up with the idea they shouldn’t be able to touch each other ever seen a bunch of five-year old boys in a playground? On what scientific grounds will class sizes be restricted? Is it really too dangerous for teachers to mark homework (and does it make a difference if the dog ate it? Does the library really need to be sanitised, or soft furnishings and toys removed? The list goes on and on.It would be easy to blame the teaching unions, and they are certainly using the crisis to push for a better deal – which usually means less work for more money – for their members. But the guidance from the Department for Education runs to dozens of pages. Schools are instructed to ensure “that toilets do not become too crowded by limiting the number of children or young people who use the toilet facilities at one time.”Local authorities are adding their own restrictions, and the more Left-wing they are, the more obstacles they are finding. No matter how hard inidual schools may be striving to make things work, behind the scenes, teams of bureaucrats and union officials are working overtime to make re-opening as hard as possible – while the parents and children suffer.The grocery chains, along with the rest of the private sector, have adapted to the crisis, and found a way to keep going. In truth, we over-regulate our schools, in the same way we over-regulate every nook and corner of the public sector. With some of the flexibility of the private sector, they could have re-opened a lot earlier. Sure, schools would be different, just as the supermarkets are different. But they would be open and operating – and that would be a big improvement on the chaos we are seeing right now.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy snails left coiling development accident scientists say","story":"It has been a story of love, loneliness and heartbreak which caused scientists across the globe to find the perfect mate for Jeremy, the unusual snail with the left-curling shell.Four years ago, the gastropod rose to fame after researchers at the University of Nottinghamasked the public to try to find a mate for Jeremy, whose mirror-image shell with genitals on the opposite side made it difficult for him to mate with normal snails.Scientists wanted to discover whether they could breed left-curling snails and find whether the quality is inherited.Now, after years of study, they have found that the genetic quirk is probably a fluke, rather than passed down from parents.Evolutionary geneticist Dr Angus Davison, from the University of Nottingham, explained: We have learned that two lefties usually make a right, at least if you are a garden snail.In other snails, being a lefty is an inherited condition, but we still don\u0027t really know how they do it.If we are able to find out, then this may help us understand how the right and left side of other animal bodies are defined, including ourselves.You could say that we tried to recreate what made Jeremy different, but this was not possible. Jeremy was special.Citizen scientists managed to find 40 lefty snails in the wild and on snail farms, and some were sent to be possible mates for Jeremy.Initially, two potential mates left the gastropod in the cold, preferring to mate with either other rather than with him.Then, shortly before Jeremy\u0027s death, one mate produced a batch of 56 babies, about one-third of which were likely to be \u0027fathered\u0027 by Jeremy.Over three years, nearly fifteen thousand eggs were hatched from four generations of snails including Jeremy.The new evidence shows that rare lefty garden snails are not usually produced due to an inherited condition. Instead, they are mainly produced by a developmental accident.This finding has relevance to understanding the common factors that define animal asymmetry, including humans, and the origin of rare reversed iniduals in other animal groups.Dr Davison said: Our findings showed that it is usually a developmental accident, rather than an inherited condition, that makes a lefty garden snail.We helped solve one of nature\u0027s puzzles, which was very satisfying. There was also a happy ending for Jeremy, the snail, in finding love and producing offspring, albeit just before dying. None of this would have been possible without the public\u0027s help.Findings were published in the journal Biology Letters.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"urban foxes have evolved shorter snouts crunch rubbish study","story":"Urban foxes have evolved smaller brains and shorter, more powerful snouts that could help them scavenge through rubbish, a study has found. Researchers at the University of Glasgow found urban foxes are developing in a similar way to domesticated dogs.They compared the skull shapes of hundreds of foxes from London and its surrounding countryside, and found the city-dwelling animals had developed shorter snouts that would give them more leverage to crunch through rubbish such as tins or pizza boxes. The shorter jaws are slower moving, making it more difficult for the foxes to catch moving prey - not a problem when most of their food is human leftovers. But they also have larger nasal cavities, which is likely to reflect their reliance on their sense of smell to navigate the city. Researchers also found that urban foxes had less brain space and are therefore likely to be less wiley than their rural counterparts, which may be because they need less spatial memory to move around in a smaller area. The changes to the animals are similar to the effects during the domestication of dogs, and may shed light on how we came to keep them as pets, tens of thousands of years ago, said lead author Dr Kevin Parsons. “It might be that wolves, like these foxes, started hanging around people and maybe these changes in skull shape started to happen, that actually shrunk their brains and made them more amenable to domestication,” he said. There are an estimated 150,000 urban red foxes in England, a nearly fivefold increase since the 1990s. Dr Parsons said he was keen to find out whether the UK’s brazen urban foxes, who have been known to enter homes and can regularly be seen walking the streets in daylight, really were fundamentally different to their rural counterparts. “I come from Canada and the foxes there are terrified of people, while I’ve had them walk right past me here,” he said. Dr Parsons said the study could reflect the fact that urban foxes find it easier to survive if they are more docile.“There’s a phenomenon called urban tameness - animals actually get used to being around people, and that seems to be what’s going on with foxes in the UK,” he said. “There could be a selection for foxes that are more docile, or calm.”The study also found that males and females become more alike in size, another common feature of domestication. In urban foxes that may reflect the fact that female foxes tend to do more of the work, or because there is less competition between males. The findings reflect those in a 50-year experiment in Russia, where researchers have been breeding foxes in the hopes of domesticating them. The friendlier foxes tended to also have shorter snouts and smaller brains. Keeping a fox as a pet is legal in the UK, but despite all this, we’re unlikely to see foxes being walked around the dog park in the future.While the Russian experiment has led to foxes being put up for sale, “they’re not good in the house”, said Dr Parsons.While dogs are naturally social animals, which might have been the crucial factor in transforming them into pets, foxes remain solitary. “They’re more friendly, but house training is just something you can’t do with them. So they’re not really domesticated, they’re just tolerant of people.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"italy welcomes back european travellers attempt revive key tourism","story":"Italy reopens to travellers from Europe today, three months after the country went into coronavirus lockdown, with all hopes pinned on reviving the key tourism industry as the summer season begins.Gondolas are ready to punt along Venice\u0027s canals, lovers will be able to act out Romeo and Juliet on Verona\u0027s famed balcony, and gladiator fans can pose for selfies at Rome\u0027s Colosseum.But there are fears many foreign tourists will be put off visiting a country still shaking off a vicious pandemic.Come to Calabria. There\u0027s only one risk: that you\u0027ll get fat, the southern region\u0027s governor, Jole Santelli, said on Sunday as the race began to lure big spenders - or any spenders - back to Italy\u0027s sandy shores.Italy was the first European country to be hit hard by coronavirus and has officially reported more than 33,500 deaths.It imposed an economically crippling lockdown in early March and has since seen its contagion numbers drop off dramatically.With the country facing its deepest recession since World War II, it needs foreigners to return - and quickly.But it is still reporting dozens of new cases a day, particularly in the northern Lombardy region, and experts warn the government may be being hasty in permitting travel between regions and abroad.International flights are only expected to resume in three main cities: Milan, Rome and Naples.And there are concerns that those who usually go in by car, train or ferry from neighbouring countries will go elsewhere on their holidays.Switzerland has warned its citizens that if they go to Italy they will be subject to health measures on their return. The country will open its borders with Germany, France and Austria on June 15, but not with Italy.Austria is lifting restrictions in mid-June with Germany, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary - but again, not Italy, described last week by Vienna\u0027s health minister as still a hot spot.Other countries, such as Belgium and Britain, are still advising against, or forbidding, all non-essential travel abroad.In response to perceived anti-Italian sentiment, Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio has warned countries not to treat Italy like a leper.He said on Saturday he would be travelling to Germany, Slovenia and Greece to persuade them Italy is safe for foreign tourists.Arrivals in Italy from Europe will not be required to self-isolate unless they have recently travelled from another continent.Italy\u0027s lockdown has had a particularly devastating effect on the tourism sector, which amounts to some 13 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).Historic sites were shut, restaurants closed, and hotels were used to care for coronavirus sick.Restaurants, cafes and beach establishments have slowly reopened over the past two weeks - although the government has said it reserves the right to impose localised lockdowns if it sees contagion numbers rise.But only 40 of Rome\u0027s 1,200 hotels have reopened, the Corriere della Sera newspaper said, and just a dozen in Milan. It costs too much to open them if they will just stand empty.My hoteliers all want to reopen, but as long as the borders remain closed, it\u0027s not possible, Marco Michielli, deputy head of hoteliers\u0027 association Federalberghi, said.Italy\u0027s national tourism agency, ENIT, said about 40 per cent of Italians traditionally travelled abroad for their holidays, but could be forced this year to vacation at home, helping local businesses.That may be little comfort to those running the country\u0027s costly historic sites, because most of the tens of thousands of visitors who usually flock daily to the Tower of Pisa, Pantheon or Pompeii are from abroad.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel updates britons welcome portugal italy reopens borders","story":"Portugal\u0026#39s beaches will reopen on June 6When can we go on holiday again?Can I take a UK holiday yet? Will holidays be cheaper after coronavirus?For when should I reschedule my holiday?British holidaymakers will be most welcome in Portugal this summer, the country\u0027s foreign minister has said. Augusto Santos Silva told the BBC he hoped an \u0027air bridge\u0027 agreement of mutual quarantine exemption would be in place with the UK by the end of June.Mr Santos Silva described travel quarantines as an enemy of tourism.

Meanwhile, others were teaching their classmates how to wash their hands.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“They are overjoyed to be back,” says Allen – who runs Oaklea Montessori, a group of three nurseries in Essex. “They were rushing in.”Nurseries have been shut for more than two months to limit the spread of coronavirus, although some – like two of Allen’s settings – have stayed open for children of key workers.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?From Monday this week, the government gave the green light for nurseries to reopen to all children, as well as for primary schools to bring back certain classes. According to Allen, having stayed partially open throughout the pandemic has helped ease parents’ anxieties about sending their children back.“We haven’t had any cases and nobody has been ill,” she says. “I think it helps to reassure parents it is going to be ok.”Hannah Tranah, the childcare development manager at the nursery group Storal Learning, said many children were happy to be back after spending ten weeks at home.“A lot have been running through the doors excited to get back in,” she tells The Independent.“So many have been excited to be back at nursery with their friends in an environment they know well, and with staff they know well.”However, things have not gone exactly back to normal just yet. Nurseries have had to adapt for children and staff safety during the pandemic, especially due to the difficulty of getting young children to keep their distance from one another.“To a certain degree, it’s near impossible to get young children to social distance,” adds Tranah. “We are doing a lot to educate the older children about what social distancing is and why we’re doing it.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailStaff at Storal Learning, which has more than 20 nurseries in England, have been using stories to explain distancing.Allen says her Essex nurseries are not enforcing social distancing between the children.  “Particularly with under-twos, I think that would be absolutely impossible,” she added.They have capped their numbers to around half of what they would usually have, with between 10 to 12 children coming in at each setting. “We’re trying to combine groups of children so siblings are together and they remain with the practitioner throughout the day, ideally throughout the week,” Allen says. “That is a different way of working because normally there is an awful lot of flow.”They have also stepped up cleaning – for example, wiping down inidual books - and carrying out lots of risk assessments, the Essex nursery owner and practitioner says. Children can still play with soft toys – which are regularly cleaned – although there are less on offer than before.  “It is really important to keep comfort and to keep it a homely place,” Allen says. “That is very important. We didn’t want it to become completely sterile.”Storal Learning nurseries have also found ways to adapt to protect children and employees during the Covid-19 outbreak. Staff are assigned to a bubble, or a group of children who has limited contact with other bubbles, Varun Chanrai, the managing director, said. “Some smaller nurseries may have had to put a cap on occupancy but we haven’t had to do that because of the size of the buildings,” he tells The Independent.Teachers can stay away when schools reopen if they have ‘safety fears’Even at half term, families queue for food in school playgroundNot safe to reopen all schools next week, Independent Sage warnsHands and toys are washed regularly, and parents asked to drop children off at staggered times, Tranah explains. As nurseries make the first step to getting back to normal, challenges still remain for those operating with reduced numbers.   Experts have even warned some childcare providers could go out of business as they struggle to cope during the coronavirus crisis. Nearly three in four nursery leaders expect to operate at a loss over the next three months amid reduced demand and increased costs associated with operating safely, a survey by the National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA) has suggested. “It’s a real threat to the sector,” warns Chanrai​, although he is not worried about his company due to its large size.“There are challenges at the best of times, and when you’re operating at such low capacity, the challenges are exacerbated for sure.”“We need to have a reasonable consistency throughout the summer,” says Allen.“I wouldn’t be at all surprised if there are a number of settings that will close as a consequence.”Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But the Department for Health and Social Care has repeatedly failed to provide a daily testing figure in May, an omission which No 10 has been unable to explain.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile the number of people tested remains unclear, the highest known daily total was 80,297 on 21 May. The health secretary revealed on Monday that capacity is now at 206,000, however this includes at least 40,000 antibody tests, which were counted towards the target after hospitals were instructed to start using them on Friday.The largest number of tests given on a single day was 164,757 on 19 May, with the most recent total at the time of writing on 31 May being less than 130,000.The government has acknowledged that large-scale testing and contact tracing will be vital to ending the lockdown, having promised in the earlier stages of the pandemic to eventually deliver 250,000 tests a day.After the government declared it had met its initial goal of providing 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of April – a claim contested amid accusations of data manipulation – a new target for May was set.​This pledge was then watered down, with Downing Street stressing that the 200,000 target set by the PM related only to testing capacity and not to the number of tests actually carried out.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These are some of the stories behind the statistics:Sharing the full story, not just the headlines‘I work so hard yet I can’t afford the basics’: The NHS worker with no support from the stateTheo Manugerwa was struggling before the coronavirus crisis began. The 47-year-old, who lives with her two daughters aged 12 and 10 in Leicester, has been working in the NHS for 11 years, but her immigration status means she has no recourse to public funds (NRPF) – meaning she cannot claim any form of state support. As a result, the single mother has always had to work overtime in order to afford rent and provide for her children.Since lockdown started, Theo has been unable to work the extra hours.Her children are still going to school as she is a key worker, but after-school clubs are no longer operating and the friends who used to look after them while she was at work are no longer able to, due to the lockdown.She says: “It has become very hard. Once I take off my rent, I’m left with nothing at all. It has always been difficult, from the day they gave me that NRPF condition, but at least I could get extra shifts here and there to put food on the table for my children.How to support our campaign“The money I’m making now is not enough to cater for the three of us. We are depending on charity. I’ve always been very proud. I didn’t want to give in and ask for help. The feeling when you walk into a food bank is very painful. I work so hard yet I can’t afford the basics.”Theo, a Ugandan national who moved to the UK 20 years ago, is due to apply for her next visa extension next month, at a cost of more than £2,000, and she says the thought of it makes her feel sick. The Home Office told The Independent it would help Theo apply to get access to benefits under measures introduced to tackle the pandemic. But for now, she has also fallen into rent arrears, and fears she is going to generate serious debt. “I just need some support. I have no support at all. You get tired of depending on people. You don’t want to keep telling people your problems. I feel undervalued as a health worker during this time.“I feel abandoned. I’ve always worked hard to provide for my children, but it makes me feel like I’ve let them down.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Both financially and mentally,” says Sian Abbott. The 28-year-old’s family of seven started using food banks about a year ago when her husband lost his job as a poultry farmer – and she says things have become even more difficult during the Covid-19 crisis.Sian, who lives in Pembrokeshire and has five children, aged between 10 and three, says: “Three weeks into the pandemic I had a breakdown. We ran out of food because the food bank people couldn’t get to us. I ended up reaching out to my church and they sent us an emergency supply package.“It’s stressful, especially with the school closures. At least when the kids were in school they were able to get a meal. My husband and I go without meals sometimes so the children can eat.”Sian, who previously worked as a taxi controller and a carer but had to stop working to look after her autistic son, says she has noticed a lot more people who didn’t previously use food banks are now turning to them, but worries that the supply isn’t there.“In the supermarkets there used to be trolleys full of donations, but now there’s barely one. Prices are higher. The cost of nappies have nearly doubled, which is really difficult for us,” she adds.“It’s funny because when we first heard about food banks six years ago we were donating to them – usually around £50 or £60 a week – but now we’re having to rely on them ourselves.”Zoe Green and her husband David are “really struggling financially” for the very first time. The couple and their four children – aged from two to 11 – now depend on a weekly parcel from a food bank based at their local school in north London, a project supplied with fresh produce by The Felix Project charity.Ms Green, a 36-year-old freelancer who worked in TV and documentary production, hasn’t been able to find any work over the past few months. She received less than £1,000 pounds for a three-month period after applying for the government’s self-employment income support scheme.Although 39-year-old Mr Green still gets around £400 a month while on furlough from his part-time retail job, the couple have found they have a shortfall of around £300 a month for household bills. This is being met by The Film and TV Charity, but the couple do not know how long the emergency stipend will last.“It’s not been an easy time – we’ve never known food poverty until the coronavirus hit,” she said. “When we got the first food package from The Felix Project, I was literally crying as I took out all the fresh food. The work they and the other charities are doing right now is really, really appreciated. I never thought we’d need it.”“I’m really hoping the government will extend the self-employment scheme. I’m also hoping they might factor out the periods I was on maternity leave and wasn’t able to earn as much, so I can get a higher average amount.”‘Food banks have been a godsend’: Self-employed mother who isn’t eligible for government support Susan*, 45, said she found herself in financial difficulty in the months before the pandemic after her fledging health drink business collapsed.The children going hungry during the coronavirus pandemicFood bank demand soars as newly unemployed wait weeks for benefitsAlthough she set herself up as a private education tutor in February 2020, she found she wasn’t eligible to apply for the government’s self-employment income support scheme after lockdown began.“I struggled to be able to buy food during the lockdown, as I’d lost income and also fell through the government net,” said the west Londoner. “It made a difficult situation even more difficult.”She and her two children, aged 10 and 12, are now relying on a weekly food bank set up at the Bollo Brook Youth Centre on her south Acton estate. “The children being at home is tough to manage. It’s stressful trying to keep up with it all and help with their school work whilst worrying about bills,” she said.“We’ve been fortunate and receive help with food that we would not have been able to buy. It’s been godsend to get us through this time until we can rebuild our lives back to normal.”‘It’s a battle to keep people going’: Food bank manager whose demand is up tenfoldOriginally set up to provide support for single fathers, the Dads House charity now runs food banks for anyone in financial need at two sites in west and south London.Founder Billy McGranaghan said he and his volunteers saw between 30 and 50 people looking for help each day before the pandemic, but in the past couple of months demand for food parcels has shot up tenfold to between 300 and 500 people a day.“It’s heartbreaking to see the long queues,” he said. “The volume is something we’ve never seen before. It’s poverty like you’ve never seen. People tell us they’ve got £20 or £30 to get through the week. Some are telling us they’re having to sell possessions or borrow money from loan sharks.”Mr McGranaghan added: “Some people had been in very casual work before the crisis – bar staff, nannies, cleaners. So there’s no furloughing going on to help them. But in many cases they’re not necessarily self-employed either – they were dependant on that weekly wage. So they’re not eligible for the government self-employed scheme.”The food bank founder said many people were applying for universal credit, but they are forced to face at least five weeks before any money appears in their bank account.“I’m just hoping some people are able to get back into work when the shops re-open in a couple of weeks,” he said. “But at the moment it’s a battle for people to keep going.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis.

The Felix Project has supplied 1,376 tons of produce since 23 March, the equivalent of 3,276,190 meals. This support has ameliorated the deep distress of those unable to afford or access food – in particular, families struggling below the breadline, NHS workers and the elderly.The sum raised from sales of Hirst’s rainbow butterfly hearts means that we are more than halfway to our goal of securing £10m for The Felix Project to help food-poor Londoners over the next three years. It is a pledge given added urgency by the latest jobless claims, which have surged to more than two million.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMore than 4,400 people backed our campaign by purchasing the Hirst limited edition prints – 3,109 bought the small size, costing £300 each, and 1,299 bought the large size, costing £1,000. The net proceeds amounted to £1.55m. Mr Hirst said: “It’s amazing to see how people have pulled together and helped each other during this crisis. I am so grateful to everyone who has helped me do my little bit and bought a butterfly heart edition – it’s turned out to be a brilliant communal way to help raise money for The Felix Project and support their important work across London.”How to support our campaignEvgeny Lebedev, shareholder in The Independent, said: “I have long believed in the power of art and this is a wonderful affirmation of that. With the support of Damien Hirst we have passed the halfway point in our mission to ensure no Londoner in any corner of the city goes hungry because of Covid.”Other substantial new donors to our campaign include management consultants McKinsey \u0026amp Company, whose employees voted to make our appeal partner their charity of choice.Olga Nefedova, associate partner, said: “We are making a donation to organisations helping our most vulnerable communities. The Felix Project is very much one of these organisations.”So far, more than six million meals have been delivered by the London Food Alliance – established in response to the coronavirus pandemic and made up of Felix, FareShare and City Harvest – of which over half have been supplied by The Felix Project.Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, paid tribute to the extraordinary all-round effort. “London was hit hard and fast – but oh, how it has stepped up and fought back,” he said. “We are inspired by the mobilisation of businesses, donors and supporters who have joined forces with our staff and volunteers.” The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe latest figures from The Trussell Trust show April was the busiest month ever for the network of food banks, with an 89 per cent increase in emergency parcels compared with the same month in 2019.And the number of parcels provided for children has more than doubled, while almost twice as many families with children are receiving them (a 95 per cent rise).Colman visits The Felix ProjectDr Rachel Loopstra, lecturer in nutrition at King’s College London, said: “It’s clear from the data, as well as from trends in foodbank use, that families with children are really struggling right now. Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

I feel so angry, isolated, desperate to talk to someone. I have been contacting people I lost touch with a long time ago, just to have someone to talk to.”Ms Olley, who is 73 and has no television and only last week bought a computer, said staying in her London home of 40 years was having an impact on her physically.“I am beginning to feel old,” she said. “I sit on the sofa and don’t move much, so you feel like an old lady. You see people out and about and you’re stuck inside. You want to go out but I have been feeling fearful about coronavirus because of my age. You see people outside and think, ‘How come they get to go out? Why can’t I?’”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFor many people over 70 who have been told to self-isolate, the pandemic has been a mental and physical challenge. For some, it has also meant extra anxiety of being unable to access food easily.Ms Olley has come to rely for her daily meals on a doughty little charity called Made in Hackney, a cookery school delivering food supplied by our appeal partner, The Felix Project. The charity supplies 500 nutritious meals a day to the borough’s most vulnerable and nearly half its beneficiaries are over 70. Although the service was due to stop on 17 June, it is fundraising so the team can continue.How to support our campaignShe added: “Knowing that someone would come to my house and see if I was dead or alive every day – it sounds bad, but it is reassuring. The volunteers have been wonderful. They ring you occasionally to check in as well.”Another Made in Hackney beneficiary is Nigel Howat, 79, a former sightseeing bus company boss who has lived in his Hackney housing association accommodation for more than 20 years.Due to his age, he sometimes struggles to breathe. He also has a gluten intolerance, with wheat products making him violently ill. While he has neighbours to chat to from a safe distance, he has been missing his family. His stepson, Darren, was recently diagnosed with lymphoid cancer.“He lives in Merton and I haven’t seen him since his diagnosis,” said Mr Howat. “Normally I would be there to support him, but that is impossible at the moment, so it’s been hard.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The charity suggests up to 2.4 million people aged 70 and over have difficulty with at least one element of daily living.Angus Wyllie, 72, from Barnet, has struggled with cooking and operating his iPad to keep in touch with his relatives.“I am more of a ‘put a ready meal in the oven’ kind of person,” he admitted. “My iPad packed up early into lockdown which meant I couldn’t contact people, or get deliveries.”He has benefited from the largesse of Katie-Louise Barber who has been cooking hundreds of meals from Felix-supplied produce out of her home in Barnet since the start of the pandemic. She delivers her food parcels across London every week and about half are to the elderly.Top chefs ‘rhyme for restaurants’ in support of our appealIt’s a laugh cooking with kids, says actor David MorrisseyHelp the Hungry tops £5.5m following successful Hirst heart sale“Katie has been a lifesaver,” Mr Wyllie said. “She has been delivering to a few neighbours including a family of three nearby who have been struggling.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

Alex Stamos, a Zoom security consultant, said that “Zoom does not proactively monitor content in meetings and will not in the future. Zoom doesn\u0027t record meetings silently. Neither of these will change.”It is unclear how that claim matches Zoom’s CEO stating that it would like to work with the FBI, which would presumably monitor content in Zoom conversations, or whether that is even possible. We have reached out to Zoom for clarification.Full encryption for every meeting would leave Zoom’s trust and safety team unable to add itself as a participant in gatherings to tackle abuse in real time, Mr Stamos also said.End-to-end encryption, which is used on many popular apps including Facebook-owned WhatsApp and private messaging app Signal, has been a controversial matter because it would allow law enforcement to access the messages of iniduals without their consent.While some argue that it would be safer for the government to monitor their conversations in order to stop criminal activity, others argue that such an action is a serious infringement of civil liberties.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

Limiting security at a platform level for one user to stop one crime necessarily weakens protections to all users.Gennie Gebhart, a researcher with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said she hoped Zoom would change course and offer protected video more widely.Yet with the Justice Department and some members of Congress condemning strong encryption, Zoom could draw unwanted new attention through a major expansion in that area, privacy experts said.Zoom has previously been criticised for incorrectly suggesting on its website that it used end-to-end encryption and for an infamous vulnerability last year which could have allowed hackers to spy on people through their webcams.Additional reporting by ReutersBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Children who have lost a term’s schooling are effectively immune and don’t spread the virus.We know thousands are missing le-saving early diagnosis and treatment for non-Covid diseases.We know depression, drugs and domestic abuse are costing lives.Yet there are virtually no new cases of Covid outside hospitals and care homes.Scientists think the virus was already petering out as the world pulled down the shutters.They can find no evidence that ending lockdown leads to a deadly second wave.How did we end up in this state of paralysed confusion The question must be put as soon as possible to a public inquiry led by a figure of impeccable authority.It will inevitably focus on “the Blob” — the well-meaning but short-sighted officials who think they run the country.If the inquiry does its job, it will shake up the vast NHS bureaucracy, bungling Public Health England and the poorly named Sage committee of scientic experts.It will find outthe so-called Care Quality Commission let down care homes and why the Cabinet Office Civil Contingencies Secretariat was caught with its pants down.It will swtly provide the basis for a shake-up of the entire civil service, whose mandarin class desperately needs reform as Britain takes on the world after Brexit.Their foam-flecked four-letter fury is matched only by their hypocrisy.Alastair Campbell is a sad relic of his former self.

The entire show was given over to Dominic Cummings.None of it was funny, obviously. Have I Got News For You hasn’t been funny in years.What still slightly surprised me, however, was that they chose to believe every single negative story the Press had written about him, last week, including some of the stuff which, like the police hauling him in for questioning, was clearly a load of cobblers.Quite a contrast to the previous week when, based on one Mail on Sunday story, host Charlie Brooker asked: “Why do you think the Press has got it in for Keir Starmer ”Apart from the fact the entire Press hasn’t got it in for him , it’s the question’s assumption that gives the game away here.The BBC and HIGNFY have already decided Keir Starmer is great and will not tolerate any dissent.I’m grateful for it anyway, as it shines a light on the dumb equation that’s come to govern this show: Have I Got News For You believes every bad word written about the Government and disbelieves every bad word written of the Opposition.If a satirical show is stupid enough to put every politician it agrees withoff limits, it’s guaranteed to fail, which is why HIGNFY’s time has come and long gone and it deserves to be jettisoned as quickly as possible.For that to happen, though, the BBC would need to dismount its high horse, admit errors and bias and change its political culture entirely.So expect it to keep coming back.

Conventional wisdom about sound money and financial prudence has disappeared.Until recently the enemies of socialism, the Conservatives have now become converts to government action.Mrs Thatcher famously talked about “rolling back the frontiers of the state.”Now, in the wake of the Covid crisis, they have come sweeping forward once more.In the process, the public finances have taken a battering.In April the Government borrowed over £billion, a larger sum than for the whole of .The fiscal deficit is now projected to reach no less than £billion, perhaps even £billion in the worst case scenario.At the same time, more than million people — more than half the entire national workforce — are effectively on the state payroll.Even as lockdown eases, much of the economy has now been taken into the custody of the state.All this has to be paid for — and the bills cannot be met simply by printing more money.That is the route to a debased currency, soaring interest rates and hyperinflation.The reality is that massive state intervention is simply not sustainable except in an emergency.If printing money were the recipe for prosperity, then Zimbabwe would be the richest country on earth rather than mired in poverty.That is the lesson of history.If the Government carries on spending and intervening on a level that would have even made Jeremy Corbyn blush, then our country will be in real danger of sliding back to the dark days of the s.Gripped by industrial unrest and economic decline, Britain then was known as the “sick man of Europe”.Because of extravagant spending, the public finances were in a desperate state. In  inflation reached  per cent.The following year, Britain’s deficit was so enormous that the Government humiliatingly had to ask for a £.billion handout from the IMF.With the economy limping from one crisis to another, taxes soared, with the top rate on “unearned income” reaching  per cent.Some of the revenue was swallowed up in bailouts of troubled companies.In  the engine and car maker Rolls-Royce was rescued, followed by the Upper Clyde shipbuilders in  and volume motor manufacturer British Leyland in .Indeed, this was an era of institutionalised bullying by the strike-happy trade unions, who held the Government and the nation to ransom by flexing their industrial muscle.When Sir Horace Cutler, the Tory leader of the Greater London Council in the late s, was asked how many people work for London Transport, he replied, “about half of them.”In , which saw the Winter of Discontent, no fewer than million working days were lost to stoppages.At the peak of the disruption, bodies were left unburied and rubbish piled high in the street.The very fabric of society appeared to be falling part.“There is madness in the air,” recorded Bernard Donoghue, an aide to the Prime Minister Jim Callaghan.It was precisely the public’s revulsion at failed socialism and trade union irresponsibility that brought Margaret Thatcher to power in  on a  of reviving the economy.She achieved it by taming the unions, reinvigorating enterprise, restoring the work ethic and shrinking the Government.We need the same again today. All the good work of the last four decades will be undonewe slide back into the dependency culture, headed by a sprawling, sclerotic state machine.The only sure foundation on which to build a lasting recovery is by the wealth creation of the private sector.In practice that means the Government’s priority must be to encourage commerce and competition, not to dish out subsidies.So businesses should be urged to re-open as soon as possible, backed up by reductions in corporation tax and rates.Barriers to growth, like the strict social distancing limits, should be lted.At the same time, the Government should drop its plans to impose heavy-handed rules on quarantine for all travellers to Britain.It is a policy that will do nothing to protect public health but will cause huge damage to the economy, especially the travel industry.Similarly, Britain’s highly flexible labour market — the engine of the job creation miracle since  — must be maintained in the face of demands for more regulations.The best support that the Government can provide is not bailouts and bureaucracy, but a dynamic business environment along with a strong civic infrastructure, including modernised transport links and improved broadband.Soon after he became Prime Minister in , Jim Callaghan said: “We used to think we could spend our way out of recession. I tell you in all candour, that option no longer exists.”Under siege from inflation and the unions, his government was unable to abide by those sensible words.But as we come out of lockdown, their truth is more important than ever.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The NHS also removed ibuprofen as a suggested treatment for mild cases. But, a subsequent study suggested the drug did not worsen or improve patients conditions.Now, a team of scientists in London are starting a new clinical trial to seethe anti-inflammatory could in fact help speed up the recovery in some patients by reducing serious side effects.Its hoped the drug could lead to shorter hospital stays and fewer people ending up in intensive care units .Animal studies have shown that the treatment can increase survival rates by  per cent.Prof Mitul Mehta, whos leading the trial at KCL, told PA: This is very promising, but of course it is an animal study, so we want to translate that really compelling result into humans.Its a trial for patients with Covid- disease to seegiving them an anti-inflammatory drug - a specic form of ibuprofen - will reduce the respiratory problems they have.Prof Mehta stressed that the trial was for patients already in hospital, not those with mild or suspected Covid-.Volunteers will be selected from patients who are in hospital, but that are not so ill they need intensive care.Prof Mehta said: If we can reduce their symptoms at that stage we have a number of benefits. We could reduce the amount of time someone spends in hospital - they might recover quicker and go home, thats obviously a fantastic outcome.We also might be reduce the degree of respiratory distress so that it can be managed in the hospital setting, without needing to go to ICU, and thats a fantastic outcome as well.Theoretically, this treatment, given at this time, should be beneficial.But, of course, this is based on animal studies. Its based on case reports, we need to do a trial to show that the evidence actually matches what we expect to happen.The Liberate trial is being carried out at KCL as well as Guys and St Thomass NHS Foundation Trust, along with the pharmaceutical organisation, the SEEK Group.Half of the patients taking part will be given standard care, while the other half will receive standard care as well as the special ibuprofen formulation.Prof Matthew Hotopf, director of the NIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre, said: This highly innovative therapeutic approach seeks to rapidly advance a potentially important new treatment.If successful, the global public health value of this trial would be immense given the low cost and availability of this medicine.Earlier this year, at the start of the pandemic, there was some controversy over the use of ibuprofen after a French health minister advised against using it.Scientists in the UK launched a review and the NHS removed the drug as a recommended treatment for mild cases. But the findings showed ibuprofen does not make Covid infections better or worse.The Commission on Human Medicines expert working group concluded: There is currently insufficient evidence to establish a link between use of ibuprofen and susceptibility to contracting Covid- or the worsening of symptoms. To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And Britain has been very good at it.But as we slowly move out of lockdown with thoughts of shopping, seeing our friends and family, and a cool drink in a pub garden, how effective this two-metre rule actually is has become a new national obsession.Many are starting to ask: Do we really need to keep a two-metre gap  Could it in fact be ONE metre  It may sound trivial, a metre is still too far to hug, kiss, even to shake hands with friends and loved ones.But for many businesses which rely on allowing people to gather more closely — theatres, restaurants, pubs, to name but a few — cutting the official social distance in half could be the dference between keeping afloat or going under.The official advice of the World Health Organization is that one metre is sufficient, a belief shared by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.The Danes changed their position three weeks ago to one metre and most of the European countries’ public health officials advise one metre in certain circumstances.Now a new study by the WHO has found that while a two-metre distance reduced the risk of the virus being passed on to . per cent, a one-metre gap only increased the chance of transmission to . per cent.So a small risk either way, but enough to justy potentially endangering some of the industries we both enjoy and, for many thousands, rely upon for work. I have been asking for a couple of months how that distance was established, yet its origins are very obscure.It seems to go back to research on the distance between beds in the old-fashioned Nightingale wards in the s. It has become a folklore of infection control and public health, until people have started asking questions about it today.Experiments about the distance droplets travel have been conducted under such articial conditions that they are not applicable to everyday lives.Laboratory air is articially still, whereas air is not still, even when you are sitting in a room with all the windows and doors closed. Air flow breaks up the particles from a sneeze or a cough and they tend to fall pretty quickly on to your clothes or face.The serious risk of infection is when you get up to half a metre away from somebody with Covid- who sneezes or coughs.But the dference between one metre and two metres is the dference between a very small risk and a very tiny risk.To the economy, the dference is a radical one. Shting from two metres to one metre would allow us to get back to something close to business as usual. If you imagine a two-metre circle drawn around any inidual, that takes up  and a half square metres.When you come down to a one-metre safe zone, it is only . square metres. So you could get four times as many people into any given space. With the two-metre rule,  per cent of pubs and bars say it wouldn’t be economically viable to reopen. With four times as many customers, only small pubs would face dficulties.The current approach doesn’t grasp that town centres are leisure destinations and that people won’t go outit is an unpleasant experience. Shoppers want to have a coffee, lunch, try on clothes, it is a social activity with their friends.I believe that cinemas are safe to reopen and that perhaps we might be able to allow some fans back into football stadiums to cheer on their teams again.In a typical cinema, where seating is tiered and there is air conditioning,you do happen to be coughing out, the thermal heat from the bodies should rise it up out into the air conditioning system.Allowing fans to attend football matches again would be a challenge, because of the congestion going into the stadium.They would have to carefully plan entrance and exit times and leave every other seat vacant unless there is a family group, so you would probably be playing in front of a stadium which is  per cent full.I may be part of a faction that favours one metre, but the consensus is that the risk of transmission outside is very low.So joggers don’t have to go into the road to avoid getting too close to someone  on the pavement — because their slipstream will mean the droplets will probably stick to them anyway.The best way to reduce the risk of the virus spreading is a good standard of hygiene, sanitising your hands at the end of a journey and after eating.If you are involved in a lot of customer interactions, such as supermarket checkouts, Perspex barriers are helpful.The Government has taken so much flak on easing lockdown restrictions that they seem to be reluctant to get into a fight on this one. But we need to remember that interrupting the transmission of the virus is not about rules and their enforcement.It is about assessing the risk at each inidual venue, because sticking to two metres in all cases poses a risk to our economic health.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But now there’s light at the end of the tunnel, as some children begin toto school from this week. Schools have remained open to support vulnerable children and key workers’ kids, but now nursery and reception plus years  and  are getting ready to go back too. Secondary schools will also offer some face-to-face support to pupils in years  and  as they prepare for their exams next year. As any parent knows, telling younger children to stay two metres apart will be a challenge, so it’s recommended that they only mix in the same small groups each day.  Andrea Parker is lead head teacher of three London primary schools, Bonneville, Jessop and Stockwell. She explains how a “bubbles” system will work: “There will be a maximum of  children in class. In our reception classes, we’ve got around eight children in each bubble. And it’s not just about the size of the bubble, it’s about the dynamics of the bubble as well. Children are people. “We’re going to really use more of our outdoor space for reception in particular, where they will be working in smaller groups. We’ll be removing all soft furnishings, and with things like the climbing frames only one bubble can use it at any one time and then it will be cleaned down before another bubble can use it.”  Staggering the drop-off and pick-up times is important to keep children and their carers safe – and schools are putting a new system into place. “We’ve got lines painted at the entrance a two-metre distance from the boundary of the school for drop-off,” says Ms Parker. “The bubble lead will be there for  minutes, and will then take her group through a marked route to their room. And then there’ll be  minutes after that for parents to leave the streets and to wait for any late children that might come here afterwards.

Edward Argar refused to guarantee youaposll have a summer getaway - despite the government hoping to install air bridges as soon as this month. An air bridge is an agreement between the UK and one other country, which will let people travel freely between the two nations without going into quarantine when they arrive. It would spare tourists and ing Brits from having to isolate for  days when they enter the UK - a policy that takes force on Monday. Portugalaposs foreign minister today confirmed air bridge talks are under way and said people from the UK would be most welcome this summer. But for an air bridge to work, both countries will need to have a similar low infection rate to reduce the risk of a new Covid- outbreak. And Britain has one of the worst death rates in the world, with thousands of new infections still spreading per day - and the alert level still at . Another  deaths of people with Covid- were confirmed yesterday - as the overall official death toll in the UK topped ,. Despite hopes of an air bridge system, Boris Johnson reportedly told his Cabinet yesterday that Brits may have to take holidays at home rather than abroad.  Mr Argar said he hoped people would be able to go on holiday this year.But quizzed repeatedly by the BBC he was unable to name a single country that had a worse infection rate than Britain. And he told BBC Breakfast: “I’m not going to say a particular date on when that might happen.  Because we will have to be guided by how the disease behaves, controlling any risk of a second wave and controlling the disease. “I hope that people will be able to go on holiday at some point this year. But I can’t make that promise because I have to be cautious and go with the science. “And I don’t have that forward view yet of how a second wave or otherwise might behave.” It comes despite Health Secretary Matt Hancock saying the Government was considering relaxing border quarantine rules - before they had even come into force. Home Secretary Priti Patel will present full rules on the -day quarantine plan to parliament today, with spot checks and £, fines for those who refuse to isolate. There will be exceptions for jobs like lorry drivers and scientists - while people will be able to leave their homes for food, medicine or funerals.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the Government was considering relaxing border quarantine rules before they had even come into force. As travel bosses warned forcing UK arrivals into quarantine for two weeks would be a “disaster”, airlines pressed for “air bridges” with  countries where the virus is under control, including Spain, Portugal and Greece. Travellers ing from those nations would not have to isolate. PM Boris Johnson is pressing ahead with border quarantine plans as of Monday, despite a growing backlash. But No confirmed the rules will be reviewed after three weeks, which could lead to exemptions for some popular holiday destinations. And it would be in time for school holidays. At tonight’s No briefing, Mr Hancock said he was growing “more optimistic” about the prospect of Brits taking holidays abroad this year. But he said: “Clearly the number one priority is keeping the public safe. “That is the overriding principle and it has been throughout this.” Later Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: “These measures will be reviewed every few weeks, and we are working to see how we can introduce agreements with other countries when safe to do so, so we can go abroad and tourists can come here.” George Morgan-Grenville, CEO of tour firm Red Savannah, accused the Government of “ignoring the devastation” the quarantine plan would cause.  He said: “By pursuing its quarantine plans without due regard for the economic consequences, the Government is choosing to ignore the devastation it will cause to companies, to employment and to the lives of all those whose jobs will be lost. “The quarantine measures are a blunt weapon which will bring only economic disaster.” EasyJet today revealed it plans to resume flights on as many as half of its routes by the end of July, and almost a quarter of Majorca’s , hotels expect to reopen next month, something local tourism chiefs said was an “unthinkable turnaround” from a month ago.  At the end of June, , German tourists will be invited to the island to test new safety protocols. And many Brits are still planning a  getaway, a poll suggests. More than half said they still intended to go on holiday later this year, despite Foreign Office guidelines advising against all-but-essential travel overseas.

Now Tommy Collins is a symbol of hope for the Mirror-backed scheme, in which everyone in England is a potential donor after they die unless they opt out. Among the first to praise the new legislation were Tommy’s parents Alfie Collins and Maisie Davies. Dad Alfie,  – who donated a slice of liver for his son’s op – said: “We’d waited so long for a donor and in the end it felt right that I underwent the transplant for my boy. Actually I was a perfect match. The liver will grow in Tommy like a normal one and my own will regenerate inside me. It’s the body’s only organ that can do so.” He said the transplant has “transformed” le for Tommy, whose rare liver disease made him produce too much ammonia. That affected his brain, leaving him subject to fits.The transplant was conducted at King’s College Hospital in London on April  after being postponed because staff there were so busy battling the coronavirus crisis. There was a late drama when another donor was found as Alfie lay unconscious ready for the operation but surgeons opted to proceed after two earlier ones had proved to be unsuitable.Mum Maisie, , said she will never forget seeing “my two boys” head off for the operating theatre. “I prayed they would be safe,” added Maisie, who gave birth to Tommy at St Thomas’ Hospital where she is a receptionist. “This has given Tommy a new lease of le.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brits urged take knee today","story":"NewsBrits urged to take a knee today in solidarity with US George Floyd protestersStand Up to Racism has organised a protest in the UK at pm on Wednesday, June , amid widespread outrage at the killing of unarmed black man George Floyd while in police custodyShareCommentsByTess de la Mare:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsPeople in Hemel Hempstead hold up signs as they kneel during a protest against the death of George Floyd \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Stand Up to Racismhas organised the protest for pm on Wednesday as part of a day of action against discrimination in response to the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. The -year-old African American died last week after a police officer held him down by pressing a knee into his neck, provoking riots in many US cities and demonstrations across the world. SUTR said the campaign was inspired by the kneeling protest staged by American football star Colin Kaepernick in  that has become synonymous with the Black Lives Matter movement. A separate protest has been planned in Londonaposs Hyde Park at pm on Wednesday, while a further demonstration is scheduled for pm on Saturday in Parliament Square. On Tuesday, hundreds of people gathered outside St Georgeaposs Hall in Liverpool as part of a separate Black Lives Matter protest. Merseyside Police said in a tweet that while it recognised peopleaposs right to demonstrate peacefully they should still adhere to social distancing guidelines. It comes as a review by Public Health England found black, Asian and minority ethnicpeople are at signicantly higher risk of dying from Covid-.  Campaigners are now calling for a public inquiry into the disproportionate impact of Covid- on BAME communities. Weyman Bennett of SUTR said: Racism is the underlying condition that continues to kill black and BAME communities. Take the knee at pm because there is a boot on the neck of millions of people in the BAME community. Part of the cure for the virus of racism is to embrace anti-racism and anti-fascism. SUTRaposs Sabby Dhalu said: BAME communities are suffering disproportionately from Covid-, economic decline and police brutality. We call on people to apostake the kneeapos on their doorstep in solidarity with George Floyd, at pm, Wednesday  June. We stand for justice for George Floyd and say Black Lives Matter. Large gatherings are still banned under shutdown rules, and on Tuesday Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon asked protesters to find an alternative to physical demonstrations.  Speaking at her daily briefing in Edinburgh, she said: Right now, it is the case, unfortunately and regrettably, that large gatherings of people could pose a risk to health and indeed to le. We need to find ways of allowing people to make their voices heard and to make the points that many of us want to be made and to be heard right now, but to do so in a way that is safe and is not putting people protesting or wider communities at risk. The Met Police said its approach was to engage with protesters and encourage them to follow social distancing rules.

Christopher Woolard, interim chief executive at the FCA, said: #xCThe measures we have confirmed today will mean anyone who needs to can get help from their lenderthey are still struggling to pay their mortgage due to coronavirus. #xCIt is important thata consumer can afford to restart mortgage payments, it is in their best interests to do so.

The new guidance only applies to mortgages - not other consumer credit products which are covered separately. The FCA said the consumer credit product guidance will be updated in due course. Generally, mortgage interest still builds up during a payment holiday, unless the lender says otherwise, and the outstanding debt will still be owed by the borrower.

Musician and artist James Tottle set up Gted Organs two years ago to “spread the word and save more lives”. The -year-old, from Bath, Somerset, said: “Every day since I got my new heart in , I wanted to celebrate the second chance I’d been given.” So with help from friend and award-winning songwriter Julian Kay, he got together a dozen other organ recipients and in  they recorded their first song, Tomorrow. Word spread and by last September there were  members –  of whom came to Rockfield Studios, Monmouth, South Wales, to record new tracks Love of Mine and Heart and Soul. Choirmaster Julian, , said: “The opt-out system is coming in. But it’s still vital to have that conversation with loved ones before anything happens.” Visit the groupaposs Facebook page  Dylan Williams, , from Carmarthen In , Dylan had a pancreas and kidney transplant after battling Type  diabetes. He gives talks to schools and community groups on donation, saying “every day feels like I’ve won the lottery thanks to the kindness of strangers”. He said: “I’ve always loved singing, so I jumped at the chance to join Gted Organs. There can’t be a better motivation than to celebrate being alive!”  Stephen Heavyside, , from Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria In , Stephen was put on the transplant list with kidney failure. We Tricia, also in the choir, stepped up and despite not being a blood match, a revolutionary “blood-wash” treatment meant he got her organ in April .  He said: “Tricia and I joined in , shortly after our transplant. We hadn’t been in a choir before but thoughtever there was a reason to sing, it was this. I know how lucky I am for Tricia to have saved my le but also how many aren’t so lucky. Hopefully our singing can give them some hope.”  Mark Smith, , of Harrogate, North Yorks Mark spent over  years trying to control his Type  diabetes but by his mid-s it was starting taking its toll. Put on the transplant list, in July  he had a kidney and pancreas swap. Since then, he and his we have managed to have two children and he gives talks to promote donation. He said: “It’s a brilliant thing, bringing together people from dferent parts of the country, all with our own stories but one theme – transplants save lives. I hope the songs reach out to lots of people and encourage them to have the conversation with friends and family.”  John Mould, , of Loughborough, Leicestershire In , John, the partner of choir member Jane Lynch, was diagnosed with blood cancer myelofibrosis. He needed a bone marrow transplant and sister Ruth was a match. The op happened in .  He said: “I feel blessed with this second chance. “There’s a real energy to the choir and that weekend recording those tracks was unforgettable.”  Lee Gibson, , from Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria Lee joined with we Rachel in . She might not be here without her dad stepping up. He said: “I know how lucky we are to have had Rachel’s dad as a match. “My le would be so dferentthat hadn’t happened and getting with the choir and singing seems like the best way to express how grateful I am.”  Julian Kay, , from Chippenham, Wiltshire He said: “Since being involved with the Gted Organs I’ve come to know so many transplant patients and hear their stories.  As a result, I’ve made my family aware of my wish for my organs to be donated and hope these tracks will inspire thousands to follow suit.”  Mark Allen, , from Widnes, Cheshire Mark had a double lung transplant  years ago and is now waiting for a new kidney. He joined the original Gted Organs, a band project, in  as a keyboard player after meeting James Tottle at the Transplant Games. He said: “Being in the original band and now the choir has been a privilege to spread the word on organ donation. “The fact that we’re creating great songs shows what can be doneeveryone loves what they’re doing.”  Jane Lynch, , of Loughborough, Leicestershire Jane and John have been together  years and were in local choirs before joining Gted Organs last September. She said: “I thought I might lose John when he was diagnosed. Every day since then feels like a blessing. I jump at any chance to sing but the choir is special because everyone there is a survivor.”  Helen Presdee-Jones , from Cardf Helen was hit by renal failure aged , having a kidney transplant in  and then again in October last year when the first kidney failed.She said: “I’m so thankful to my donors and theirfamilies.Singing in this choir is a way I can celebrate my second – and third – chance at le.”  Tricia Heavyside, , from Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria Two years ago, Tricia saved hubby Stephen by donating a kidney. She said she had to step up after watching his health deteriorate so rapidly. She said: “I saved Stephen’s le in what was our ruby wedding year. We’re so grateful to those amazing doctors when we really did think it was game over. Singing with Stephen after  years of marriage is bliss!”  Rachel Gibson, , from Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria In , Rachel got a kidney from her dad after years of renal issues. The next year she wed and he walked her down the aisle.  She marked her op’s seventh anniversary by singing with Gted Organs. She said: “I heard about the choir from Steve and Tricia and love it more than I can describe. We share our transplant stories and celebrate le together in a way nobody  could really understand.”  Lewis Macmillan, , of Brydekirk, Dumfries and Galloway Lewis was born with a rare kidney condition and took  tablets a day. At , he got a kidney from his mum after a revolutionary procedure to change his blood type. Six years later this failed and he changed blood type again to get a kidney from his father. He said: “I met Kirsty last August at a kidney awareness weekend, who told me about the choir. The next weekend I did the -hour round-trip to Swansea to take part and loved it. “I always loved singing and can’t think of a better way to raise awareness of the human impact of donation.”  James Tottle, , of Bath, Somerset James had a heart transplant  years ago after suffering cardiomyopathy. He said: “I don’t know anything about my donor, so this is a big thank you to him or her. The Gted Organs motto is ‘Celebrate the gt of le through music’.

Footage shows a massive crowd of mostly young people dancing to music played by a DJ, drinking, smoking or just hanging out at the rave about  yards from a police station in Harlesden, north-west London. Police helicopters circled overhead for hours, fireworks were shot into the sky and the party went on until am, according to neighbours who were kept awake by the noise. The scenes sparked outrage on social media, where one local councillor said he was embarrassed and many people feared it would lead to a surge in Covid- cases in Brent, the borough with the highest number of coronavirus deaths in London. Were you at the block party  Do you live nearby  Email webnews@mirror. There was a huge police presence at the event, with video showing about a dozen officers being jeered as they try to make their way through the crowd at one point. Neighbours said the party went on for hours and finally wrapped up around am. Police stayed on scene until about am and helicopters were still circling overhead at that time. Councillor Joshua Murray, a member of Brent Council, tweeted: As Harlesden councillor Iaposm embarrassed of whataposs happen tonight. I will be working with community leaders to find solutions because at the end of the day my residents are suffering because few people want to have a dance during a week day when people have work the next day. He added: In area where kids who are not back at school canapost go outside tomorrow cause there is broken glass everywhere. We need to do better.  A woman named Lisa tweeted video of the party and tagged police, Brent Council and local MP Dawn Butler. She wrote: Seriously  This is happening on Church rd Harlesden right now!! Can hear helis above. Guess no gets any sleep night. Selfish idiots. As residents called on the party to be shut down a Twitter user named Bianca wrote: Fireworks   Really    This Harlesden party is the biggest joke. What you celebrating   A woman named Dee urged the revellers to go home, adding: Media outlets will just spin this and make it look like it is our fault that we are more likely to die from Covid because of our irresponsible behaviour and not because of racial inequality in this country. Another user tweeted: Not getting an early night with the helicopters hovering over Harlesden. Who decides to have a block party during a pandemic  A third wrote: I’ve been put in the high risk category for covid so I have to self isolate and I feel trapped. Not because I can’t go out, but because I live in Church Road, Harlesden, an area where many people are ignoring the lockdown. Tonight’s block party hasn’t helped at all.He later added: am and the last of the police vans are gradually leaving Church Road. Helicopters are still doing the rounds and I think some of the locals are more p***ed off with the helicopters than they are of the block party, which I think finished about am. Another resident, named Miki, wrote: F***ing hell, helicopters finally stopped after like  hours! Apparently a huge rave in Harlesden  Brent about to soar to the top of the covid charts again. A police spokesperson said: Police are currently in the area of Gford Road, NW, following reports of an unlicensed music event.  Officers are engaging and dispersing a large group of people gathered in the area. There has been one arrest. The National Police Air Serviceis providing assistance. It is the latest incident to fuel fears of a second wave of infections as Covid- cases and deaths currently trend downwards.

A former Invictus Games soldier, who asked not to be named, said: “We spoke about the Games, I was very respectful and did not ask him anything about his new le or anything. “He simply said he misses his role with the Marines and would like one day toto the appointment.” The chat is understood to have happened shortly after lockdown began.

He with we Meghan, , the Duchess of Sussex, and their son Archie, one, are living in Los Angeles. The Queen is yet to appoint his replacement but it is believed Princess Anne may land the prized Marines role.

The Sun reports having seen a apossecret blueprintapos to kick start Britainaposs pub trade which has been drawn up by ministers in the Department for Business. Breweries, meanwhile, have ramped up production on kegs of beer - which were stopped at the start of the pandemic to focus on cans and bottles - the newspaper said. The aim is reportedly to deliver  million pints-worth of booze by June  as hopes continue to rise that UK pubs may open sooner than expected. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.    The Governmentaposs guidelines reportedly include Wetherspoon-style app ordering systems to avoid people queuing at the bar, while tables will be placed two metres apart. And while other European countries are urging their pubs to use screens between tables this is said to not have been included in guidelines for Britain - though screens will be available for staff at the bar. It is also understood pubs with outdoor beer gardens could open first as part of a two-stage process.  Under current plans, pubs, hotels and restaurants will remain closed until at least July , but this could soon change. Last week, Boris Johnson told MPs the scientic advisory group for emergencieshad been told to review the guidance about social distancing. Pub trade bodies are currently pleading with the Government to minimise the two metre distancing rule to just one, with many boozers too small to make re-opening worthwhile under current guidelines.  This still remains a sticking point, Mr Johnson has admitted, but said work was being done to try and reduce the recommended distance. The boss of British Beer and Pub Associationhas said more than three-quarters of pubs could reopensocial distancing rules were relaxed to one metre. Chief executive Emma McClarkin warnedthe two-metre guidance remains, just one-third could reopen their doors and many would face further financial misery and ruin.  The internationally recognised social distancing standard, used in the likes of Italy, Denmark and France, is to remain at least one metre away, as advised by the World Health Organisation . However, a study published in medical journal The Lancet this week suggests cutting social distancing to within m could increase the likelihood of coronavirustransmission by more than four. Many pubs have been taking advantage of recent hot weather and a loosening of the lockdown restrictions to offer takeaway drinks.  However, Ms McClarkin said polling of BBPA members showed about % could not survive until Septemberthey remained closed, and the pub sector was burning through roughly £ million in cash every month during lockdown. In a letter to Chancellor Rishi Sunak last week, BBPA, British Institute of Innkeepingand UKHospitalitycalled for furlough salary for pub and hospitality staff to be maintained at % until October. Last month, Wetherspoonaposs said it will spend an initial £ million making its  pubs Covid- secure, ahead of reopening, including screens at bars and tables. The chain said each pub will hire two full-time workers to regularly clean surfaces and touch-points throughout, with more employed in larger pubs.

In footage that has since gone viral, the Canadian leader is seen pausing for an agonising  seconds, appearing to choose his words carefully before he stares down the camera and speaks. Footage of his silence gripped viewers, as many speculated the Prime Minister was holding his tongue so he could deliver a measured answer. The two leadersapos styles contrast heavily, but Mr Trudeau has followed diplomatic convention of avoiding direct criticism of his counterpart in America, upon which Canada relies heavily for exports. However the leader appeared to struggle to remain neutral as Mr Trumpaposs handling of the protests erupting across the United States draws widespread criticism. The leader has been accused of egging on the use of force against peaceful protests - as well as violent demonstrations -  in his tweets and speeches. The Park Police and Trump administration denies using tear gas, in what has become a contentious issue as observers have pointed out seeing police wearing gas masks at the scene, while some reporters found what appeared to be aposOCapos cannisters, a type of pepper spray.The incident, moments before Mr Trump read a bible for a photo opportunity, drew particularly sharp condemnation amid a chaotic week in a United States dually grappling with the coronavirus pandemic and civil unrest over racial discrimination tensions. Police broke up a peaceful and legal protest in Lafayette Park across from the White House ahead of a speech in the Rose Garden by the president on Monday. Afterward, Mr Trump walked across the cleared park to make a surprise visit to a church, where he raised a Bible, without making mention of Floyd.  The protesters are demanding justice over the death of the unarmed black man who died after a policeman pinned him by his neck to the ground for nearly nine minutes in the Minnesota city of Minneapolis.  Sympathy protests have since been launched across the States and around the world, including in Canada.Asked about the incident at a news conference, Mr Trudeau was captured taking a long pause before answering, in a silence described iously as aposepicapos and aposawkwardapos on Twitter.When the Canadian PM finally and haltingly replies, he does so without mentioning Mr Trump directly.

Mike Ryan, the executive director of the World Health Organisationaposs emergencies programme, said: Clearly the situation in many South American countries is far from stable. There is a rapid increase in cases, and those systems are coming under increasing pressure.

Mexican senator Martha Lucia Micher was on a the video call with members of the National Regeneration Movement political party, the Bank of Mexico and journalists on May .As they discussed the impact the coronavirus was having on the country, the -year-old politician began to remove her clothes, The Daily Star reported. Ms Micher did not realise that her webcam was still running, prompting screenshots of the mishap to circulate on social media. The senator apologised for the mishap but was clear that she had nothing to be ashamed of. She said: “I am Malu Micher, and I am not ashamed to have shown part of my intimacy by accident, because it is exactly the notion that a woman is ‘just her body’ that has allowed and fomented the objectication of women against which I have always fought. “I am a woman of  years of age who has breastfed four children, three of whom are today professional and responsible men, and I feel proud of my body for having nourished them. “I am a woman who has fought for the left for almost  years and who has occupied ious public roles in my fervent commitment for the defence of human rights, I am a woman who is not ashamed of her body, I love it and I take care of it.” Many other colleagues and politicians also retweeted her letter and posted on social media to show their support for the senator. Fellow senator Ricardo Monreal Avila wrote: “In view of the attacks against her, a product of a mishap during a virtual meeting, we endorse our fellowship.  Morals and integrity will always be stronger than infamy and assaults.” Another senator, Maria Elena Morena posted: “The rubbish stinks in the senate and on social media. Our political and party dferences should have limits.” It is not yet known who took the screenshots.

testing figures as misleading","story":"A north-east MSP has claimed the UK Government#s coronavirus testing figures are #misleading#, following criticism from Britain#s statistics watchdog.Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been rebuked by the UK Statistics Authority over figures which are #still far from complete and comprehensible#.The chairman of the organisation, Sir David Norgrove, criticised the way the figures are presented at the daily Downing Street briefings, with the headline total including both tests carried out and those which have been posted to recipients but not yet conducted.North-east Labour MSP Lewis Macdonald said adding the two figures together was #misleading# and not the #right way to use the statistics#.He added: #It might tick a box in terms of what the government has to do but it doesn#t actually tell us how many tests are being carried out.There needs to be public trust in what they#re told and the way the numbers have been approached really doesn#t achieve that.#Lewis Macdonald, North-east Labour MSP.#I think it#s right to say statistics have to be consistent and clear and provide information that people can understand and trust and that#s absolutely critical to containing this virus.#There needs to be public trust in what they#re told and the way the numbers have been approached really doesn#t achieve that.#The UK Government has hit targets aimed at carrying out , tests a day by the end of April and having the capacity for , tests of ious kinds by the end of May.However, Sir David said the testing statistics still fall #well short# of its expectations.He added: “The data should tell the public how effectively the testing programme is being managed.“The way the data are analysed and presented currently gives them limited value for the first purpose.“The aim seems to be to show the largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding.“It is also hard to believe the statistics work to support the testing programme itself. The statistics and analysis serve neither purpose well.”The aim seems to be to show the largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding.#Sir David Norgrove, chairman of the UK Statistics Authority.Sir David said there is a lack of data on how many of the tests posted out are, in fact, then successfully completed and the date when tests are carried out.He also called for test results to include information on what kind of employment people were in #

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

These allow vets to make the best diagnosis possible and give advice or treatment whichever is required.Medications and prescriptions can be collected from the Tranent surgery or posted or delivered via courier to clients.Reception staff are extremely busy as they have to determine which category the phone call falls into. There is no such thing as making a basic appointment now. Everything takes much longer to discuss and consequently sometimes the telephone system is overwhelmed.You can, of course, leave a message or send an email, contact websites or Facebook pages. Someone will respond to your question as soon as possible. The reception team are doing a wonderful job, as of course they are at all veterinary practices. They are our frontline heroes who deserve special applause.At Dunedin Vets, we are now seeing more emergency cases after triage.Dogs and cats who are now almost three months overdue their boosters can now have them. This will prevent them having to restart their vaccine course and means their owners only having to visit the practice once.All pups and kittens who had first vaccines before lockdown should have had their second vaccines now. Pups can start vaccine courses as long as they have been in their new home for at least one week, are over ten weeks old and their owners are not self- isolating.We are trying to delay kittensrsquo vaccinations as long as possible ndash especiallythey are not going out.We will try to do one vaccine at neutering time, to reduce the number of visits. If your rabbit is due boosters just now, as many rabbits are, prior to going outdoors, both vaccines can be given at the same time rather than two weeks apart ndash again reducing the number of outings to the surgery. Clients are not allowed in the surgery, having smaller animals in cages and dogs on leads helps in the handover of pets.I am sure all veterinary practices have been thinking about when we can have clients back in the surgery.At Dunedin Vets, we will have safety shields on reception desks and distancing stickers as well as hazard tape on the floor. Staff will be wearing masks and visors and there will be a limit to the numbers of clients allowed in the surgery at any one time.Hopefully we can open our other branches and have all our staff back at work soon. Until then we continue doing as we are doing and keeping everyone safe.During this period of lockdown there have been some ongoing cases which have required regular treatment, examinations and blood tests. These include diabetics, dogs with Addisonrsquos or Cushingrsquos conditions and cats with blood pressure and thyroid problems as well as those with heart conditions.One patient who had to be seen throughout this time is Buri.Buri is a four-year-old German Shepherd dog belonging to Mrs Sarah McHale and family who visit our Dunbar surgery.In November , Buri was seen at Dunbar with an apparent urinary tract infection. He had been drinking more and going to the toilet lots. When examined, he was a fit, lively dog, but had several large lymph nodes under his neck.Rhiannon the vet took a sample from the glands which I examined under the microscope. I found some large, unusual cells. Buri came for a biopsy under anaesthetic.The samples were sent to a laboratory for testing and unfortunately the results were not good. Buri had lymphoma, a cancer of blood cells which results in enlargement of lymph nodes. This is a form of cancer which we can treat in practice with chemotherapy.The particular type of lymphoma Buri had would respond better to a drug he needed to have at Edinburgh Vet School. So for the next five months, every week Buri attended either our Tranent branch for one type of chemotherapy and sometimes to the Vet School at Penicuik for the other.He had to take tablets every day as well. He had numerous blood tests to check his blood count and to check all his organs were ing well. He also had urine samples checked to make sure no problem was developing.He was such a good lad. He had to be away from his family when the chemotherapy was being administered.Vet Jonny and nurse Fiona, dressed in their chemotherapy PPE, became his best friends. He seemed to love coming to the surgery bouncing about and wanting to play with everyone.He responded very well to his treatment. His lymph nodes reduced rapidly. He remained happy and healthy, eating well and had very few side effects from the chemotherapy. The weeks wore on and Buri became a regular at the surgery, usually on a Tuesday afternoon, when all the staff looked out for him.When lockdown came, we received a message from the Vet School that they were unable to carry out further chemotherapy treatments.Buri was at the end of his treatment there.We continued to give him his chemotherapy for three more weeks, when on April , he received his very last dose.He was still the happy boy we adored. We decided to ring that final chemo bell and give him a round of applause which he justly deserved.His mum had to stay at home self- isolating but we shared a video and photos with her, which she loved.She was happy for us to spread the good news and our Facebook video post went viral.No doubt Buri will have ups and downs and may require further treatment but we wish Buri and his family every good wish for the future.Stay safe everyone."},{"url":null,"title":"column-qmus-important-research-role","story":"NICOLA Sturgeon has now released the Scottish Governmentrsquos lsquoroute maprsquo for leading us through the Covid- crisis, which is available for everyone to read on the Scottish Governmentrsquos website.As of today , we will begin to work through the phases of our gradual emergence out of lockdown.Whilst we all want to get back to normality, it is important that we strike a balance between protecting the publicrsquos health but also in allowing people to have inidual freedoms.In phase one, you will be able to meet with one other household at a two-metre distance, as long as it is outside, and many outdoor sports such as golf and tennis will be permitted.The overall message remains: stay as home as much as we can, to avoid a second wave.I would like to congratulate Queen Margaret University on being awarded pound, from the Scottish Government to support it in rapid coronavirus research.This will be sure to play a signicant role across Scotland in understanding the effect that the virus will have.Research such as this is fundamentally important in developing policies and treatment for Covid- and this will undoubtedly contribute to saving lives.To commend this good news, I have submitted a congratulatory motion to my colleagues in the Scottish Parliament and I hope this will be well supported by them.I would like to thank QMU for undertaking this work, and wish the researchers working in this area all the best.I would like to thank community councils for all their work in supporting the local area through this challenging time.I know that many have been making efforts to ensure people have access to food, prescriptions and also emotional support.Our community councils often make huge dferences in our community but receive little recognition for their hard work."},{"url":null,"title":"community-resilience-communities-aberlady-gifford-haddington-athelstaneford-longniddry-macmerry-gladsmuir-ormiston","story":"From collecting shopping and vital prescriptions to dog walking and simply being there for people, the volunteers are there for residents throughout the coronavirus crisis.Here, we look at six of the groups who are giving up their own time to help out.Aberlady.

But it will remain for some time I suspect.My thoughts on the beach the other day drted to my older kids, who I have been unable to see because they are on the other side of that invisible fence.Then I remembered a scene in a novel I read when I was at high school.The novel was Lord of the Flies by William Golding.It left a deep impression on me at the time.The story is about a group of boys who are stranded on an uninhabited island after an airplane crash.They are without any adults, and so they must organise and govern themselves in order to survive.At first they do this by having rules and symbols of authority that everyone respects.One of the boys finds a conchand itrsquos used to give democratic order to discussions.A boy called Ralph tries to maintain this semblance of order and fairness, but it all starts to break down.Gradually, the modes of behaviour they learnt in society before the crash erode, as some of the boys realise they can now do what they want.The scene from the novel which I remembered describes how one of the older boys, called Roger, throws stones close to a younger boy named Henry, who is playing on the beach.He wants to hit him, but he doesnrsquot.Golding explains why: ldquoRoger gathered a handful of stones and began to throw them.ldquoYet there was a space round Henry, perhaps six yards in diameter, into which he dare not throw.ldquoHere, invisible yet strong, was the taboo of the old le. Round the squatting child was the protection of parents and school and policemen and the law.Later of course, Roger finally rejects these taboos of the old le, and actually kills another boy with a rock.By this time, the new society created by the boys on the island has become cruel and despotic.The conch has been smashed and a boy called Jack has become a power crazed leader, ruling with terror.At its core, the novelrsquos message is a very pessimistic one that when the constraints imposed by commonly agreed standards of behaviour and humanitarian respect are removed, people will descend into uncaring and savage norms of behaviour, led by power crazed rulers.The novel was criticised for this pessimism, but of course there are many examples in history, and in current times, of despotic cruel regimes and societies.But my thoughts on this, as I played with my younger kids on the beach, were that there are more good folk in this world whose collective will has made those boundaries and keep them in place.I see it all around me people in communities creating norms of kindness, consideration and care.Yes, therersquos rudeness, selfishness and aggression too, but every smile, every kind act, every respectful exchange dilutes them and helps shore up the norms of a caring society.That protective invisible fence we currently have around ourselves is a product of our care for others as well as for ourselves.What gives it strength is not so much enforcement, but the understanding that for the benefit of others we sometimes canrsquot, or shouldnrsquot, just do what we want.Integrity and honesty are the cornerstones of this.We can disagree on objectives and priorities, but without these values our conch is broken.I have had some discussions with my youngest daughter recently about the importance of owning your actions and taking responsibility. Shersquos six and she gets it.These were my thoughts as I walked the Pans shore with my youngest kids.But I was thankfully taken out of them by my wee boy, who is currently obsessed with King Kong.He asked me: ldquoIs that island over there where King Kong lives "},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-open-take-place-renaissance-club-october","story":"The impact of the coronavirus saw the Aberdeen Standard Investments Scottish Open postponed last month.However, the European Tour has now confirmed that the tournament, which will be played at The Renaissance Club, near Archerfield, will take place from October -.Keith Pelley, European Tour Chief Executive, said: ldquoSince the suspension of our  season in early March, we have taken a measured approach in reassessing our schedule, informed every step of the way by our medical advisers and government guidance.ldquoWe have consistently said that safety is our absolute priority and that is why today we are announcing our resumption in two monthsrsquo time supported by a comprehensive health strategy which has been led by our medical team.ldquoWithout question we have had to think dferently about the remainder of our  season which is reflected in todayrsquos announcement.ldquoAs golfrsquos global Tour, ersity is ordinarily one of our biggest strengths, but in this instance it has become one of our biggest challenges.ldquoInitially, therefore, based on the expert guidance we received, playing in clusters, in one territory, is the best option in terms of testing, travel and accommodation.It is the second year in a row that the competition has been played at the East Lothian course.Last yearrsquos event was won by Bernd Wiesberger after a play-off with Benjamin Hebert.Currently, the Aberdeen Standard Investments Ladies Scottish Open is pencilled in for August - at the same venue.Last yearrsquos event was won by Mi Jung Hur."},{"url":null,"title":"community-resilience-communities-cockenzie-port-seton-humbie-east-west-saltoun-bolton-musselburgh-prestonpans-tranent-elphinstone","story":"From collecting shopping and vital prescriptions to dog walking and simply being there for people, the volunteers are there for residents throughout the coronavirus crisis.Here, we look at five of the groups who are giving up their own time to help out.Cockenzie and Port Seton.

The firrst houses are due to be built later this year.He said: ldquoWe have a unique opportunity here with a blank canvas for a new town at a time when climate change is central to policies.ldquoI also think the Covid- pandemic has driven forward the idea that people can work from home and find alternative ways to work with the support of digital technology.Central to the vision is alternative ways to travel with an emphasis on walkways and cycle routes.A new train station at a central hub within an area the council has dubbed Greater Blindwells will provide additional access to public transport.To the north of the central hub between Cockenzie and Port Seton and Longniddry there are proposals for a water park or outdoor leisure area with the potential to create a lido, space for kayaking and other water sports.At the former Cockenzie Power Station site, less than half-a-mile away, a new centre of excellence is proposed described as a training school and ldquoexemplar development in modular manufacture and construction.The council is launching an eight-week consultation on their vision for the area from tomorrow and people will be able to go in and give their views.They are also hoping that as lockdown restrictions ease they may be able to have outdoor exhibitions for people who cannot access the proposals online and will be advertising the consultation locally so people can get in touch through the post.The Scottish Government is currently looking at revising its framework and the council has made its case for the wider area to be classed as a National Development, which will give their proposals support at a national level.The consultation will open at https:eastlothianconsultations  from Monday, June ."},{"url":null,"title":"aldi-launch-cooling-mats-stop-cats-dogs-overheating","story":"The month of May has served as a pleasant reminder to the nation of how glorious the weather can sometimes be in the UK.Last week saw the hottest temperatures of the year so far and many people took to sunbathing in their gardens, as well as in parks and on beaches, after the government eased some lockdown measures on Sunday,May .To help keep your pet by your side, and feeling cool while you soak up the sun, the discount retailer is selling cooling mats priced from pound., as part of a iety of new pet accessories being launched in stores and online as part of its Specialbuys range.When did the pet mats go on sale The supermarket began selling the mats, along with other items in the pets Specialbuys range on Thursday, May .Proving extremely popular, all of the rangersquos cooling mats have now sold out online at aldi and it is not known when they will be back in stock.However, you can still purchase the mats in store.What mat designs are there The range features ious designs, such as a circular watermelon printed mat as well as a lemon printed option.The mats can be easily cleaned with wipes and stay dont require any freezing to keep them cool, as they are specically designed to remain at a cool temperature.What  is in the range As part of the pet range, Aldi is also selling a set of three cooling dog toys for pound. which includes a ball, shark and bone.Other items in the range include cooling pet bowls priced at pound. each and a luxury pet bed bundle for pound..Itrsquos worth noting thatyou choose to purchase any items in the range online, you will have to pay a delivery fee of pound.your order is under pound."},{"url":null,"title":"council-says-soon-open-car-parks-playparks","story":"East Lothian Councilsaid its coastal and country car parks wouldremain shut during the early stages of lockdown easing as the Scottish Government urged people to stay local.However, the decision did not deter sunseekersfrom driving to the beacheswith somecars parked irresponsibly and some on yellow lines on the roads outside the beauty spots, as our pictures show.A council spokesperson urged people to respect the advicefor people to still stay at home as much as possible and warned fines would be issuednecessary.Parking attendants were being sentto the busiest spots to start ticketing motorists who had ignored the parking restrictions.The council spokesperson said: \"Itrsquos important that we all continue to follow the really important national advice, including physical distancing and staying close to home.\"The First Minister has advised that car parks which have been closed should stay closed at this time.\"Our decision was taken to protect local communities living by these destinations and with full support of Police Scotland.

This can lead to problems starting your car when it comes time to get back to work. Better keep those jump leads handy.Rustybrake discsA rusty brake disc can be a real problem.When your car is being usedregularly, your brake discs can take care of themselves - but when left standing for too long, they can rust.This happens when rain falls on your brake discs and is left to dry out.Normally any surface rust comes off through using your brakes the next time you drive, but when the cars off the road this doesnt happen and repeated soaking and drying can cause the rust to build up and badly damage the brake discs.Fortunately most of the country has enjoyed mostly dry weather during this lockdown so - butyou think your brakes arent working as they should, you need to get them checked out urgently.Flat tyresIm sure it wasnt like this when I parked it.If youve got a slow puncture, it can take quite a while before your tyre deflates enough to be noticeable. If you had one before you stopped driving, by now it could well be completely flat. Before setting out on your journey, check your tyre pressures to make sure theyre all still safe.Low oilOver a long period of a car not moving, oil can start draining down through the system into the sump.

They have done it for much less in the past.While the Political Declaration as part of the Brexit deal points to both sides using their ldquobest endeavours to get an agreement on fishing rights by July , securing a deal by that date is not a legal requirement.Mr Deas stressed fishing rights should be separate from the wider trade talks but there was a political reason for Brussels to link them.:Nicola Sturgeon: Covid- resources will be erted to no-deal Brexit plansno talks extensionNoting how the EU fleet fished six times as much in UK waters as British vessels did in EU waters, he explained: ldquoThere is a big dferential there that gives the UK quite a lot of leverage. On the EU side, the leverage is the threat to withhold a trade agreement unless the UK concedes on fisheries.

The industry has already had four years of uncertainty since the referendumhellipIn relation to fishing, we feel strongly there are no reasons why we cannot leave the CFP by the end of this year and be going into these [quota]negotiations at the end of this year for the fishing opportunities in  as an independent coastal state."},{"url":null,"title":"any-offence-strictly-intentional","story":"In a new interview for the BBC Scotland series Billy and Us, the retired stand-up recalls his mid-s gigs being picketed by Pastor Jack Glass.Glass had demanded an apology for Connollyrsquos Last Supper and Crucixion routine, in which the comedian imagined the final days of Jesus beginning with a drinking session in a pub on Glasgowrsquos Gallowgate.ldquoTherersquos something appalling about being asked to apologise for having a point of view, Connolly tells the programme. ldquoSomething quite fascist about it. I refused to apologise and I refuse to this day to apologise.In a career noted for busting taboos on everything from sex to sectarianism, few of Connollyrsquos routines have caused more controversy. Connolly says the row led to his name being ldquoremoved from the books at his primary school, St Petersrsquo Girls and Infants, in Glasgow.

Jesus came in and said lsquoWhere did you get that rsquo One said, lsquoOh, Judas bought them, he seems to have come into some money.rsquo That was the joke. I thought it was hysterical. That night I told it on stage and I expanded on it.The routine featured in Connollyrsquos best-selling album, Billy Connolly Live. The resulting furore put his name in the papers, which led to his first booking on the BBC chat show, Parkinson, in .

I didnrsquot set out to do that but they take offence so easily. All yoursquove got to do is talk about them, what they do, and theyrsquoll find offence in it.Introducing religion into his routines was another way Connolly broke the mould. Once voted ldquothe comediansrsquo comedian in a poll of his peers, Connolly says the dference between him and traditional comics of the time was that they were happy to do racist, sexist, homophobic material, and he was not.ldquoYou didnrsquot speak about religion or politics.

Pastor Glass and protesters are seen handing out a newsletter, Scottish Protestant View, denouncing Connolly. One banner calls the comedian a ldquoblasphemous buffoon. Another takes him to task for calling the crown of thorns ldquoa jaggy bunnet and describing Jesus in ldquoa drunken state.ldquoIf he makes a public apology we would be happy to end our campaign, says Glass.The preacher died in . According to Connolly, he could be menacing at times.ldquoHe became kind of evil, Jack. He would come up beside me and say, what would you doChrist was to judge you now  Crucy Christ again, he would say, and hand me three nails.Connolly, who was diagnosed with Parkinsonrsquos in , now lives in Florida. Just as his persona has shted from scourge of the church to beloved Sir Billy, so the film reveals his attitude towards religion softening.ldquoTherersquos a side of religion I really like. The side that comforts the lonely, that encourages art. It explained the world to a lot of people for a long time.

While many species canrsquot cope, some types of animal are especially good at living within cities.Red foxes are prevalent within several UK cities, including in Scotland, where they have become well-established.Dr Kevin Parsons, of the Institute of Bioersity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, said: ldquoWe wondered whether this change in lestyle was related to adaptive dferences between urban and rural populations of red foxes.ldquoWe assessed skulls from hundreds of foxes found within London and the surrounding countryside and saw that urban foxes had a smaller brain size capacity but also a dferent snout shape that would help them forage within urban habitats.ldquoThere was also less of a dference between males and females in urban foxes.The researchers - from the Universities of Glasgow, Bristol, Edinburgh and Massachusetts and National Museums Scotland , tested whether dferences found between urban and rural red foxes had any similarity to what is found across dferent species of foxes.Dr Parsons added: ldquoThis could tell us whether the evolution of urban rural dferences was completely unique or something that has potentially happened previously.ldquoIt turned out that the way urban and rural foxes dfered matched up with a pattern of fox evolution that has occurred over millions of years between species.ldquoWhile the amount of change isnrsquot as big, this showed that this recent evolutionary change in foxes is dependent upon deep-seated tendencies for how foxes can change.ldquoIn other words, these changes were not caused by random mutations having random effects the way many might think evolution occurs.The findings suggest that, while urban foxes are not domesticated, they are changing in ways that move them closer to what is seen in many domesticated animals.Dr. Andrew Kitchener from NMS, co-author of the study, said: ldquoThis is important because human-animal interactions are continuous and some of the basic environmental aspects that may have occurred during the initial phases of domestication for our current pets, like dogs and cats, were probably similar to the conditions in which our urban foxes and other urban animals are living today.\"So, adapting to le around humans actually primes some animals for domestication.The teamrsquos research paper, ldquoSkull morphology erges between urban and rural populations of red foxes mirroring patterns of domestication and macroevolution, is published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society Series B."},{"url":null,"title":"evidence-5-000-year-old-neolithic-fabric-found-orkney","story":"Evidence of woven Neolithic textile has been confirmed at the University of the Highlands and Islands Archaeology Institute research excavation at the Ness of Brodgar.Only one other such example has been found in Scotland.The archaeologists at the site do not physically have a piece of ,-year-old fabric, but the impression it leaves when pressed against the wet clay of a pot.Organic material from prehistory does not survive often unless in very specic oxygen-free conditions in the archaeological record, so the study of Neolithic textiles has to rely on secondary evidence.To date, there is only one other piece of evidence suggesting the use of woven textiles in Neolithic Scotland - another clay imprint discovered in  in Dumfries and Galloway.These exciting new discoveries have come to light during a project started in  at the Archaeology Institute of the University of the Highlands and Islands by Jan Blatchford and Roy Towers to closely examine impressions left on the surfaces of sherds of Grooved Ware pottery unearthed at the Ness.The project uses Reflectance Transformation Imaging- a technique that uses a photographic rig to take multiple photos of a subject, each with a dferently angled light source.These pictures are combined, using computer software, to create a highly detailed digital image of the surface of an object that can be examined from all angles and enlargements and examined on screen. The results reveal surface details not visible during normal examination.In this case, two co-joining sherds carry the imprint of a woven cloth. The impressions appear on the inner face of the vessel, suggesting they were made by the potterrsquos clothing during the potrsquos creation.These were first discovered by one of the Ness post-excavation volunteers, Lorraine Clay, who noted a clear impressed cord.She showed the sherds initially to Jan Blatchford and then Emma Smith, a regular at the Ness and a textile analysist and conservation specialist.Dr Susanna Harris, an expert in European prehistoric textiles, was able to give a second opinion on the RTI confirming the identication.This impression of a piece of Z-ply cord, around cm long and mm in diameter, is so clear it is possible to see the inidual fibres. Although the possibility of an additional textile impression was noted by Emma on initial viewing of the sherd, the ability to view the sherd under RTI has allowed this to be confirmed.The imprint appears to show finely woven cloth, but the impression is less defined than the cord, meaning details of the weaving technique used is dficult to ascertain - although the yarn used was probably plant-based, possibly flax.Within Neolithic Scotland textile finds are incredibly rare, and no other examples on Orkney. The one other documented example from Mainland Scotland was found at Flint Howe, Dumfries and Galloway. It consisted of a small impression of a plain-weave textile on the exterior of a Late Neolithic Early Bronze Age vessel.Ness of Brodgar Site Director Nick Card said, There is no evidence of textile tools available in Neolithic Orkney, suggesting textiles were made by hand, or using tools made with organic materials that have not survived in the archaeological record.ldquoThis lack of material culture around textile production can help us to infer what techniques they may have been using. The project is also revealing rare basketry and other cord impressions.ldquoA growing number of base sherds from the Ness have impressions of coiled mats used in the construction of clay vessels. These match examples found at Barnhouse and Rinyo in Orkney and also at Forest Road in Aberdeenshire. All specimens suggest fibre mats of spiral construction that may have eased the turning of the pot as it was formed and even facilitated its transportation whilst it was dried and then fired.Some body sherds have plied cord impressions on their exterior surfaces. Short s of plied cord impressions, known as lsquomaggotsrsquo, are often used as a decoration on some Neolithic pots but the irregular and unevenly impressed nature of the markings on the Ness examples may indicate that the marks are accidental.It may be that the pot was held in some form of basket whilst the clay was still wet. Further examination of the lsquomaggotsrsquo is ongoing. Cordage and textiles would have been essential in prehistory, facilitating essential survival activities such as hunting, fishing, foraging, storage, cooking and providing warm clothing, matting and bedding. The incredible survival of organic remains at the Bronze Age site of Must Farm, Cambridgeshire, highlights the prevalence and complexity of fibre technology in British prehistory.Work continues to document and interpret these impressions, which, it is hoped, will provide an invaluable insight into the fibre technology of the Neolithic.The Neolithic British Isles refers to the period of British, Irish and Manx history that spanned from circa  to circa , BC."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-cant-snp-treat-us-like-adults","story":"The SNP-led Scottish Government has lectured us for more than a decade about our eating, smoking and drinking habits, all to no avail for the most part.

It has been out of step with other countries who have had public health measures in place at their airports and ports for months.ldquoDespite repeated calls from opposition politicians including myself and public health experts for measures to be taken, the UK has had no such protections in place. The Home Secretary has abjectly failed to take charge of this policy, implementing quarantining so late that it may have missed the point of its effectiveness, watering down her plans further undermines the basis of the policy change she has announced.ldquoWhen the Home Secretary comes before Parliament she must outline the scientic advice behind her decisions, and why the UK Government has moved so slowly and out of step with the international community.:Ian McConnell: Is it Tory instinct that is risking the ship for a haprsquoorth of tar on furlough scheme From Monday anyone arriving in the UK will have to quarantine in one place, and provide contact details of relatives in case they fall ill.

And don’t use public transport unless it is absolutely necessary.”The first steps out of lockdown could only involve “careful and cautious” changes, she said.In Orkney, this means that travel on public bus and inter-island ferry and air services will continue to be for essential reasons only during Phase One, with passenger numbers severely restricted as a result of and in line with social distancing requirements.Across Scotland it is assessed that social distancing will reduce transport capacity by  per cent –  per cent and this figure is very much in line with the assessment in Orkney for our ferries and local bus services.During Phase One, there will be no changes to the current timetables for local bus, ferry and inter-island air services.For Orkney Ferries, the aim is to help protect residents in the isles from the risk of infection – along with the crews who operate the service – and to ensure that the ferries can continue to run and deliver freight and other essential supplies.The Scottish Government’s new guidance, published on Tuesday , will help public transport operators and passengers prepare for the further lting of lockdown restrictions at a future date.Detailed information from the government on the newly announced Public Transport Guidance has been sent to the council. Careful consideration is being given to how this might apply locally when the move to Phase Two begins.The guidance does state that people should wear face coverings when using public transport and further information on the council’s expectations on this will be provided in due course.The government has acknowledged that there will be geographic challenges in implementing the guidance and that there can be no ‘one size fits all’ to the approach taken across Scotland.The government’s latest travel advice is available here: https:www.transport.gov.scot coronavirus-covid- transport-transition-plan advice-on-how-to-travel-safely copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Orcadian has made continued appeals to for the figures to be made public, along with other key figures relating to the outbreak in Orkney, and members of the wider community have called for transparency when it comes to way the crisis is being managed in the county.As it stands, Orkney has recorded eight test-positive cases of coronavirus, but no figure is available for the number of tests which have actually been conducted within the county.Now, it appears that regular updates on the number of folk being tested in each health board area in Scotland will soon be made available.Responding to a question put forward by Mr McArthur on the matter at today#s Topical Questions at Holyrood, health secretary Jeane Freeman indicated that information on tests conducted through NHS controlled facilities will be available shortly, subject to quality assurance. She explained: “We’re working to make sure that we give as clear and as robust data as we can possibly can and, as soon as we’re ready to publish that, and with what frequency we will update it, I’ll make sure Mr McArthur knows that.”Responding to this confirmation from Ms Freeman, the Orkney MSP said: “With test and protect already up and running and some restrictions now being eased, it is even more critical that the public are equipped with accurate, reliable and timely information so that they can make informed decisions going forward. “The number of confirmed COVID cases and COVID-related deaths are already published daily, but the public are still being left in the dark about the level of testing taking place.  Without these figures, it is impossible for anyone to make sense of what is happening on the ground.  “Being open and transparent about testing numbers is crucial to building public trust and confidence which, ultimately, is a key component in keeping our communities safe as we begin to ease restrictions over time.  “The First Minister not only agreed with me this point but also gave an assurance that ministers would now consider how to make this data available. “The Health Secretary has now provided her own assurance that the information will be available shortly. This needs to happen now, however, as the continued delays are doing nothing to help build public confidence at a time when people are desperately looking for clarity.” copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If successful, the global public health value of this trial result would be immense given the low cost and availability of this medicine.Early on in the pandemic, there was controversy over the use of ibuprofen after a French health minister advised against the use of it.Scientists in Britain launched a review to assess ties to the drug and Covid-.The Commission on Human Medicinesrsquo expert working group concluded: ldquoThere is currently insufficient evidence to establish a link between use of ibuprofen and susceptibility to contracting Covid- or the worsening of its symptoms.copy -.

Now, why does not Nicola change the dictate for Shetland  We would love to sunbath also, between the snow showers!!!!!😂😂😂😂How fortunate that the Scottish, Welsh and Irish leaders are maintaining their more sensible , balanced and wary approaches .Enlighten us Haydn, why is the infection rate lowerin England than in Wales and Scotland  I for one am not the least confused by the messages, just what is confusing you She niver agrees wIth what the rest off the UK IS DOINGBruce, you make it look asNicola, is acting like a Tory##..The Tory policy being##..me, me, me and melolSince you appear to not know, there has been confusion in Britain today about the actual meaning of BoJo’s statement yesterdayand , as I write, he is trying to explain himself away on TV. THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters. It is understood that Miss Sturgeon has been learning Madrin while Scotlandis locked upOwen Jones has denied that he supports Identity politics, woke culture and he is not a social justice warrior.CNNhires Greta Thunberg to appear on a  as an expert on Covid .Best not to bother with why UK has biggest obesity problem in Europe. Such inquiry requires social science, some sociological imagination and a grain of empathy.Much easier to blame those poor plebs who haven#t got a grip.No need to invest on ending intergenerational deprivation and increasing opportunity too.Playgrounds for schools in poorer parts of our cities Why bother.Simples Peter, integrate #Care# for young and old into the NHS. That would include a voucher towards joining a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Those who chose not to use it, be it on their heads, it is their own health and wellbeing which will suffer. Covid  is ruthless with the obese and unfit,blame and empathy are not part le and death struggle of potentially fatal illness.Ian#s suggestion does nothing to end intergenerational deprivation, aka poverty. Poverty, and other social ills, can result in obesity in ious ways.Obesity simply is not automatically a #lestyle choice#.To suggest so is to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming.Not all single parents on benefits, depending also on whatever the Foodbank might provide, can easily promote healthy lestyles for all of their children.Many are struggling with issues beyond Ian#s limited appreciation.Seven year olds don#t generally make lestyle choices. Fat cells, once over produced in response to whatever unwelcome stimulus, don#t simply disappear. They hang around calling to be filled.Not all parents have time or money to afford Shetland Recreational Trust#s offerings.They dont all have the ability to get their children to the leisure facilities.It is only #simples#you take an uncaring and simplistic approach. Ian knows this intellectually as it has been pointed out more than once. Yet he persists. Odd. A little more fellow feeling might stem his approach.All I am suggesting Peter is an attempt to control excessive eating of Junk foodswith integrating our NHH with free access to all to a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Just how can that be #to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming. #Where are you getting your figures on childhood obesity in Shetland from Ian  Surely not from the newspaper article you’ve linked below, which is from  and quotes figures for adults from  If Ian imagines free education and access to the NHS has equalled le chances this is going to be a walk in the park.If Ian imagines the Welfare State to be thriving why so many Foodbanks  On another planet does not just describe Boris and Dodgy Dom today.There are also undernourished children in Shetland and across the UK, and parents going without in order that their children can eat. Ian might be interested to research the number of food banks before the era of Conservstive austerity and see how well the number has grown since. Quite an achievement for his #thriving welfare state#. Soon unemployment numbers will be thriving too thanks to the ghastly response to Covid  fromBoris and chumsThirty thousand deaths a year is a pre-covid figure we now have obesity as a % factor in covid  deaths!!If we were talking drug deaths running a food bank would be an offence. Perhaps that is a little tongue-in-cheek but this year obesity will be a factor in about , people dying prematurely. Surely about time for gyms, fitness and participant sports organisationsto be granted by integrated into the NHS with a free or subsidised entry for all.Sorry Peter, Boris and his chums were working with Nicola and her chums on Covid  . All in harmony which must be a first!Covid  was away with the fairies, another socialist ideal.!It is mildly reassuring that Ian Tinkler has #no faith in politicians# presumably including BoJo the Clown. This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.Ray try and understand the dference between political comment and malicious point-scoring.ian seems to be using dferent measurement criteria between scotland and england and even dferent data within scottish figures. on  may he has scottish figure  but on  may it has gone up to .the lower figure is the one for deaths from positive test cases, the higher one is all deaths where covid is mentioned on death certicate.in his original calculation for england he uses positive test figuresthus for accurate comparison he should use the lower scottish figure also. this is what alan leask has done and produced an accurate comparison.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved.I did read it Ian # that’s how I know it’s completely irrelevant. Now you’ve produced aarticle from ! So, just to be straight, your reasoning for easing the Coronavirus lockdown in  is a  year old newspaper article about obesity  I don’t think that’s the real reason is it now  Could it be that you’re putting your political prejudices first again  Not that it matters of course. Now even the FMs most recent slight adjustments to lockdown only allow five-mile car run to a place to exercise. That does not get a Glaswegian far from the centre of Glasgow. It just does exactly the worst thing, concentrates people together in highly populated areas. The counterargument regards spreading the virus into new areas is fallacious. Just in case our FM had not noticed, the virus has already disseminated widely and in the great outdoors of Scotland Social Distancing is a lot easier than in Glasgow or any other city.So, the death ratio in Scotland from Covid , according to the self-proclaimed STE expert is .. That, I believe, is patently incorrect, not to mention entirely absurd, and would mean that . people from  person had died from the disease. As an analogy, based on a notional teeth count,someone had, let’s say, ten teeth and subsequently had one removed then the ratio of teeth removed to those not having been removed would be  , or %. The “survival ratio”, as someone referred to, ie the teeth remaining, is the remainder as a proportion of the whole, in other words  out of , or %, assuming that the dentist extracts within remit. The two equations are not inter-changeable. This, however, from the statistical and other real experts acknowledged in their fields is very interesting: A good point and as always I appreciate a good dental analogy to illustrate the dference between death and survival rates. I know here we like to fight tooth and nail about such things, but it is good to see someone #filling in# the gaps here. And as for Mr. Tinkler, he certainly puts the effort in and even though we may disagree, it keeps things on here lively. He deserves a plaque.Michael Inkster, Try .Decimal point one, not  to  . Actually maths was wrong recalculation above. Simples absurdly so, evenmental arithmetic was a little rusty first time round!!Since it appears to be much more virulent and deadly than flu the future would seem to be less than rosy.In fact, depressingly gloomy and all the statistical information so diligently presented will be consignedto no more than being purely academic and capable of making not a scrap of dference.I am more intrigued into the sources of  major viruses having a global impact from China, and what is the Chinese Government doing about the health and safety of food products and the, apparent, lack of any proper procedures in which to prevent further outbreaks  What is the WHO doing in regards to monitoring potential infections from China and or limiting the movements of live animals in poorly developed hygiene conditions, allegedly We hear the origins of such viruses, but no information regarding preventative measures taking place to restrict and confine such health hazards within an area and to stop this from spreading further afield  Why has there been no ban on the sale and transport of certain foods from China Is the whole process of live animal meat production having to be totally reviewed by the Chinese government or is it a case of waiting until something even greater forces them to act Should we enforce our own standards of Health and Safety onto other countries in terms of a trade agreement or should market forces have a free for all without any restrictions, including Health and Safety  Should this be reviewed JOSEPH NIVEN has hit the nail squarely on the head. The statistics are not clearly put and blaming one UK politician, BoJo or Sturgeon is wrong. The SNP and Torie parties pretty much followed identical policies until last week.If Ian imagines free education has eliminated inequalities of opportunity he is mistaken.inequalities of opportunity frequently come down to ambition. The opportunities are there for all, not everybody wishes to take them.Sure good sound parentage and background help promote ambition, but the old adage you can take a horse to water but!!! If you wish to destroy ambition, try extreme socialism. The good old USSR and present-day Venezuela give good examples.I don#t know where to start with this statement Ian, and I#m not sure it will make any dference to youI do.There are multiple stories on just this very subject, but since you are not a big fan of the arts, you might not have read them, seen them or heard them.You can have ambition, and even a great education, but still be knocked back by the old boy network, or because you are not white or not male. These inequalities still exist.There are statistics to show that Eton boys get the top jobs still, and the only way to get a better leader for this country will be to do away with privilege and try to level the playing field. New Zealand for example have a great leader and it is refreshing to see someone lead who has her role on merit.I know nothing of the countries you mention but I am sure they still have ambitious and educated people despite your partisan viewpoint.Well it’s a surprise to see that the Scottish government aren’t being blamed for poverty and suffering this time # turns out it was the underprivileged’s own fault all along. I’m sure a sharp word will snap them out of it and everyone will be a CEO or a government advisor in no time. Just need to put the effort in old boy what what! I’d always thought the morally bereft who profit from misery and desperation who have a lot to do with keeping the poor poor have a lot to answer for though you know payday lenders, gambling companies, private dentists with a monopoly#Ian might as well say the poor are frequently to blame for their lot. Oil rich Norway does not tolerate UK levels of inequality.Neither do many other poprer countries.Quite what the USSR and Venesuala have got to do with it is likely apparent to Ian.Others will see their inclusion within what passes for his argument as a clear attempt at distraction. The possible impacts of being brought up in poverty by others who have had the same dficulties are many.The opportunities for such children are not easily compared to, say, those enjoyed by the young Boris Johnson.Ian is again indulging himself in victim blaming.UK policy has not set out to create level playing fields for socio-econmic participation. It should, but won#t for as long as #One Nation# English Conservatives like Boris Johnson continue to serve the interests of those of Ian Tinkler#s outlook over those of all. On th of May Ian described intergenerational deprivation as #relevant to Victorian times#.NY pretending ambition alone can help all children born into poverty to escape it Ian is demonstrating Victorian attitudes of his own. Seven year olds brought up in bedsits should choose better parental lestyles.I was unaware Thatcher, Blair, Cummings, Callahan, Wilson et all went to Eton. Mind you, Tony Ben, Sir Antony no less went to Westminster college!!!! Quite what that has to do #With the price of tea in China # rather like your former comments, escapes me!The one with us, young Dominic, no Eton education, the poor wa. Privately educated, Oxford University. Married to Mary Wakefield, daughter of Sir Humphry, raised at Chillingham Castle, Northumberland. Descended from a former colonial governor of Kenya. Good point Ian # definitely not part of the old boy#s network # Cummings never went to Eton and only went to his father#s small estate in the North rather than his we#s family castle. Oh the deprivation they suffered! Glad to see social mobility bringing such paupers to the upper echelons of society.Johan, Ian#s not just a contrarian, compelled to rile others, but does so to share his quite unpleasant world-view. He talks of intergenerational deprivation as being a #very trendy left-wing academic hypothesis, relevant to Victorian times# but it#s a known fact that many a bairn raised in poverty, enjoying few opportinities will go on to live in poverty and have few opportunities. If they become parents, the likelihood of their bairns being able to do better lessens generation by generation without purposeful government action designed to level the playing field.The concept used here is social mobility and many governments globally take pains to increase it. Where those with disadvantageous starts in le go on, on average, to do better than their parents,social mobility is high. Where their lot is likely to be fixed at birth social mobility is low. Scotland has a long running research project to monitor it. In addition to the factors you cite, cards can also firmly stacked against children raised by semi-literate, or drug dependent parents, or in situations of domestic violence or sexual violence as well as other non-lestyle factors. Ian knows obesity can have complex causes, but doesn#t care. Its quite tragic.Poor parenting is really not a class thing whatever are trendy humanist academics may say.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

Some teachers engage well, others not. Just like traditional schooling.The talk and plan is that schools will reopen physically after summer, possibly and probably in a very dferent manner.It seems however, that there is a rush to adapt an old norm to a new unknown reality.This is understandable, as change is always uncertain, and it is safe to stick with what you know, but perhaps we will be missing an opportunity to create a new reality.Begin afresh with a blank piece of paper.If our best creative thinkers were asked to make a framework for educating young people, starting with that blank sheet of paper, with today’s technologies would they build the institutions we have today Would they build a school Perhaps it would be unfair on the classes of  or  and further, to experiment with them and their futures, so undoubtedly things will be kept as normal as possible. But with curriculum change and continual development flux is nothing unusual.There have been plenty experiments in the past.It is already quite radical to have suggested staggered start times, blended learning and a concentration on screen contact.Perhaps national exam level provision could develop into a drop-in style of tutorial seminar-based provision, where a school is a resource to be used as required, and not attended per se.Perhaps the new normal could have place-centred outdoor learning as its core.I heard one teacher complain on the radio, “we are educationalists, not child minders”.There seems to be a blurring between parenting, social work and education, and schools appear to be being used as a solution to all societies’ ills, becoming all things to all people.The role that schools have played over and above teaching has become evident during Covid and lockdown as parents have had to look after their children continuously.Situations are all unique, and there will have been a whole spectrum from embraced appropriate enjoyable home learning, to dysal chaos.Most families have probably been somewhere in the middle, but sadly in some cases schools have had to continue providing a haven for vulnerable children.Most importantly there is “NoWrongPath” even more so today when destinations may be more uncertain.Resilience, empathy, creativity and integrity will be what our children need in the future.I think the class of  will be fine, they have had a unique experience which will help make them who they will become.Travel is likely to be harder in the near future, how easy it would be to take a family around the world or ride a motorbike a long distance for a gap year is debatable, but there will always be opportunity for experiential adventure.Routes back into traditional education are always available, perhaps even more so now.I suspect universities will be desperate for students, and will be creating access courses to enable those with uncertain schooling certicates.When I was caught ‘skiving’ PEI had no idea I would end up running an outdoor activity centre.When I was failing physics A Level at school, I had no idea I would end up with a Masters degree from Edinburgh University.While the First Law of Thermodynamicsis a crucial and fabulous bit of knowledge, it probably isn’t what helped me when my motorbike gearbox broke in Jericho.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Clear-Your-Head-5-1.jpg","title":"scottish government make time to clear your","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe coronavirus pandemic has changed le for everyone in Scotland and had a real impact on how many of us are feeling.Some people will have felt low whilst coping with the necessary restrictions, maybe struggling with their emotions for the first time and finding themselves angry or upset for no reason.As the nation moves into the first phase of easing lockdown restrictions, the coming weeks may bring a mixture of dferent feelings and emotions as people start to think about going outside again – but there are things that can be done to make it easier, with help and support available.Supported by SAMH, Breathing Space and the Samaritans, the campaign website – clearyourhead.scot # also provides sources of help for those who need to talk to someone about how they’re feeling.Whether it’s dealing with the pressure of juggling childcare with work commitments, facing continued isolation at home, or feeling anxious about ing to work, there are things you can do every day that will help you through it.Keeping to a routine as much as possible, by sleeping and waking at the same time and eating at regular times can give your day structure and help you feel more in control.Now we’re able to go outside more than once a day, making time to go for a walk, jog and cycle can help boost self-esteem, energy levels, and importantly help us sleep better.Staying connected has never been more important, particularlyyou’ve had a bad day or are feeling stressed.

Having grown up in the era when the river was dominated by the huge red brick edice of the Braidwater Mill, Rodney points out that its path is more exposed to public view than ever. “When you look back, it was pretty much enclosed space from McNinch Footbridge to Harryville Bridge.  “People had no reason to be in that area unless they were mill workers.“Nowadays we have great views right along this section and I personally feel that there has to be a joined up approach to making full use of this fantastic potential.“With the opening of the retail park it has now opened the area up to everyone and the nature and beauty around the river with wildle such as swans, ducks, otters, kingfishers and other wildle regularly seen on the stretch from Sainsbury’s down to Harryville bridge,” he said. But he acknowledges that not not everyone will see the beauty associated with the area. “There will always be some who will still treat it as a dumping ground and continue to put the wildle and the environment at risk by dumping their refuse into the river. “These people need to be told in no uncertain terms that this will not be lolerated by the local community - we have the ability to impose fines on those who continually flaunt regulations and I would call for such monetary penalties to be used more frequently.”But Rodney beleives the real driving force behind the naural rejuvenation of the area must comes as a united push.“ I feel that the authorities responsible for this area and the retail park owner have to take seriously the issues associated with this stretch of water and listen to the concerns of the community groups and members of the public who regularly use the pathways around the river for daily exercise.“My opinion is that things weren’t thought through properly at the outset and the environmental issues weren’t taken into account when the retail park was being planned. “The aim now should be to preserve the beauty of this stretch of the river Braid and that means taking steps to make sure this happens.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3138062.jpg--.jpg?1590480532000\n","title":"slemish is part of three peaks fund raising event for air ambulance","story":"AIR Ambulance Northern Ireland, supported by Boost Drinks, has launched the annual ‘Three Peaks Challenge’ - which includes Slemish Mountain on September !

In this time it has seen two World Wars, the NI Troubles and now, of course, is facing our latest war against the Coronavirus. Just footsteps away from the church, it is a school with strong links to the local farming community. Pupils benefit from a child centred education, which is enhanced by the schools countryside setting, providing regular outdoor learning.Despite this and the schools recent achievement, the school is currently proposed for closure in Summer . This comes as a signicant blow, as the school has been a constant champion of community values in past and recent times. The school has proved an epicentre for numerous local events and community activities from car washes to last years K Run which have brought all sections of the community together for time together in fun and friendship. Strong community opposition has been voiced and it is hoped that NI Education Minister, Mr Peter Weir rules in favour of keeping the school open.

One MLA suggested a travel restriction should be imposedthe problem continues. It came as Health Minister Robin Swann warned the battle against Covid- is finely balanced.Images showed crowds of mainly young people gathered at Helen#s Bay and Crawfordsburn on Monday and not observing the two-metre social distancing guideline.At the weekend parts of the north coast were packed, too, with reports that some people resorted to defecating in public as toilet facilities are currently closed.Last Friday at Ballyholme beach in Bangor a police officer was injured while trying to disperse a large crowd of young people.In a separate incident in north Belfast on Monday a -year-old girl required hospital treatment for a cut to her chest after being subjected to what the PSNI described as a vicious assault by a male gang after young people gathered at the Invest NI site near Springfield Road. A -year-old boy was also injured.Northern Ireland#s chief scientic adviser Ian Young said he fears the events of recent days could push the R-rate, the virus#s reproductive number, above . Keeping it below  - it is currently between . and  - is crucial to avoid exponential growth in cases.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAndrew Muir MLA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappAndrew Muir MLAAlliance MLA Andrew Muir said that Stormont should consider toughening the restrictions, which currently permit travel to beauty spots.If this situation continues we#re going to have to look at the regulations because we can#t allow a repeat of that, he told the Belfast .I know people have asked can police or Translink not turn people away, but the way the regulations are drafted there is unlimited travel, and also these locations are open.So whether we have to, unfortunately, close some of these beauty spots and beaches, which is disadvantaging the majority of people who are law-abiding, we have to dothere#s a repeat of what happened.Mr Swann, speaking at Tuesday#s Covid- briefing, admitted that while the public#s adherence to the lockdown was fraying he was not calling for police to be given additional powers to enforce the coronavirus regulations.I don#t think we#re in a place yet where we need further legislation to actually bring in further penalties on those young people who are gathering, he said.What I#m asking them to do is act responsibly, to think about their actions and the effect their actions have on their loved ones should Covid be found in their group of friends and the onward transmission that would have. In regards to empowering police to enforce a two-metre distance, I think that would put an enormous pressure on an already under-pressure police force at this minute in time.At present the two-metre social distancing measure is a guideline, not a rule.Mr Swann referred to images in the media in recent days showing long queues and crowds of young people at parks and beaches. He said that while he did not want to lecture young people, he urged them to show restraint.It does appear that for some people the compliance with restrictions and social distancing measures is starting to fray, he added.Our battle against Covid- is finely balanced. Yes, we have made important progress against it, we have flattened the curve and saved many lives. As a result of that immense effort we have started the process of cautiously and gradually edging out of lockdown.But we are still at a very early and tentative stage of that process. It wouldn#t take that much to tip the reproductive spread of the virus over the all important ## figure.He reminded the public that this is not an extended public holiday, adding: People are staying or working from home for good medical and scientic reasons.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseInfrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappInfrastructure Minister Nichola MallonHis comments were echoed by Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon and Justice Minister Naomi Long.

The public health message is clear: social distancing must be practised by all iniduals and each of us have a personal responsibility, said Ms Mallon.Mrs Long said: While there is no law against travelling to beauty spots to exercise and enjoy our magnicent scenery, I would urge anyone who does so to act responsibly when they get there.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseChief social worker Sean Holland FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappChief social worker Sean HollandChief social worker Sean Holland said that while he backed Mr Swann#s message to young people, some teenagers had found themselves in dficult circumstances during the lockdown.It is also worth remembering that some of those young people seen out and about in the parks have been in lockdown in situations that are far from ideal... some of those young people may have found themselves contained in homes in situations which are neglectful or abusive, he said.Belfast Most ReadDerry twins Aoe and Adamsaw beloved dad die from a massive heart attack at  ... now their mum wants you to send them a birthday card to help heal their griefCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Swann warns lockdown #not a holiday# as he announces £.m support for care homes, NI workers may be exempt from UK#s -day air travel quarantine ruleMcDonald#s opens two NI restaurants for drive-thru and deliveryFive people including child in hospital after Co Antrim car and tractor crash,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I didn#t go out and I wasn#t in a good place mentally.It was Pete who got me online, without him I wouldn#t have access to the online exercise classes. He taught me how to get on this Zoom thing, so I could get the Friday chat with my friends. We all have a chat with Pete and his we Kathleen, we sit and talk about how we#re feeling. It all means a hell of a lot to us.He had the patience when others didn#t to make sure I was connected as I live alone.Ms Doherty said being able to log on for the classes has given her a reason to get out of bed.She continued: The classes make me get out of bed in the morning and it helps to have routine to my day. It starts the day on the right note.The exercise class can involve sitting on a chair and using tins of beans as weights and other things around the house. We would also do relaxation moments to help you relax and it is a gentle pace of exercise. Pete is one of the best andyou spoke to anyone out of our class they#d be saying the same thing.Before lockdown part of Mr Simm#s job with the Old Library Trust was community visits to carry out blood pressure checks.But when Covid- prevented him from doing this aspect of his job he was determined to ensure the physical and mental health of the people in his local community didn#t suffer. He said: When lockdown happened we couldn#t go out into the community to check people#s blood pressure but there were many people who were borderline high blood pressure or have hypertension or diabetes, who already took part in our exercise classes at the Old Library Trust to help manage their conditions.Keeping physically active is important in helping to manage such conditions as hypertension and diabetes as well as helping people#s mental health during this time. So although we couldn#t physically meet up we wanted to ensure people kept exercising so we increased the amount of exercise classes we offered and moved them online.Belfast Most ReadDerry twins Aoe and Adamsaw beloved dad die from a massive heart attack at  ... now their mum wants you to send them a birthday card to help heal their griefCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Swann warns lockdown #not a holiday# as he announces £.m support for care homes, NI workers may be exempt from UK#s -day air travel quarantine ruleMcDonald#s opens two NI restaurants for drive-thru and deliveryFive people including child in hospital after Co Antrim car and tractor crash,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

More shops at its retail park section will be open next week, such as Argos and Currys.However, in the short term only outlets with direct street access or direct access within a retail park are allowed to open - which rules out many non-essential outlets in shopping centres such as fashion retailers.Rushmere says it already has well-established social distancing practices, with one-way systems, live footfall cameras, floor stickers to mark two-metre gaps and heightened hygiene measures.It is in a category of shopping centres which have fared relatively well during lockdown because of its essential shops. But for other centres which are dominated by fashion and leisure offerings such as restaurants and coffee shops, it may be a dferent matter.Gone will be the pattern of shopping centre visits in the past - a leisurely dander through Primark or Next, followed by spontaneous visits to other shops, rounded off with a cappuccino and cupcake in a coffee shop.Instead, we are likely to face prolonged queues for the most popular stores - and once inside, there will be one-way systems restricting our way around. And the popularity of stores like Primark could mean that you will have to book a visit in advance.After all that queuing and bulk-buying, you might fancy a coffee and a sit-down - that could mean even more queuing outside the coffee shop, especiallyits capacity is cut from  tables to  in order to maintain social distancing.You might think, I#ll sit down on a mall seat for a rest instead. But as Peter Murray of Newry#s Buttercrane Shopping Centre has said, mall seats have been taken away, which means no lingering.The role of shopping as a family expedition might also change - stores which have to restrict numbers may not want a family group of five taking up space. The only customer who counts is the one with the buying power, rather than the bored kids.Many stores rely on impulse buys to bump up average spend - but there will be less scope for impulse.However, the hassle of queuing may mean that people do more planning ahead, therefore more bulk-buying could take place. There are just a small number of essential retailers open in CastleCourt Shopping Centre in Belfast, such as Halax, Holland  Barrett and Superdrug. It usually has around . million visitors a year. Across the city centre, Victoria Square is closed as it has no #essential# retailers. The big question, too, for both centres is whether office workersto the city centre in large numbers.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThey have been a destination for retail therapy for years - but one observer remarks that there may be more anxiety in shopping centre trips of the future FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThey have been a destination for retail therapy for years - but one observer remarks that there may be more anxiety in shopping centre trips of the futureOur observer says: Locations that have the most essential retailers and are more community centres are the ones that will do better long-term. Yes, footfall may be down % but at least they have maintained shoppers and their shopping habits.The big issue iseveryone stays at home and doesn#t go back to the big urban areas to work shops and shopping centres will all be affected. You might normally have , transient workers and students in a city centre, butthat goes down to ,, that has the biggest impact of all.The physical layout of stores may also be dferent. With fewer people allowed in at a time, retailers might adjust the space for actual shopping, and instead increase their storage space - especially since goods which have been ed will need to be quarantined to make sure they#re virus-free before theyto the shop floor. Changing rooms are already out of bounds.Of course, plenty of us are die-hard shoppers and nothing will put us off spending our money when we#re allowed to do so in brick-and-mortar stores rather than online. It might just take a bit more planning than before.

By Allan PrestonJune   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA shielding Belfast pensioner who cannot leave his home for fear of infection has said he feels ignored over government arrangements for food deliveries.James Hutchinsonlives with a serious lung condition, COPD, which means he and his we June have not crossed their front door in  weeks.He is among over , vulnerable people in Northern Ireland who have been told to stay at home by GPs. Last month, Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey announced a scheme for those who are shielding to register for priority home deliveries from supermarkets.Mr Hutchinson signed up straight away, but says a month later he has heard nothing and is still relying on his daughter Christine to drop off groceries at home.I just haven#t had any contact from anybody and it#s infuriating, he told the Belfast .We#ve been scared to go outside since the lockdown announcement was made. My family are happy to help but we don#t like asking them, because God forbidthey passed something on and had that on their conscience.Mr Hutchinson said his COPD means he is classied as highly vulnerable.My chances of surviving Covid- would be zilch. My we has asthma but isn#t shieldingshe went out, though, and got the virus and brought it home it would be just as bad.There#s been nobody across this door since March. They can sit in the front garden, but we would have to wipe down the garden gate with disinfectant.I would love to go out and have a coffee, but it#s the fear factor that keeps me inside.We both have a car but we can#t use it. My daughter will start the engine up sometimes and throw the keys back into the garden.Boredom#s a big issue for us as well, but we#re thankful for small mercies that we#re still here.He said recent scenes of people breaking lockdown restrictions with house parties and crowding at beaches were infuriating.Teenagers may be care-free once they#ve had a few beers, but they#re fighting with police on the beach in Ballyholme.There should be light at the end of the tunnel as the numbers are dropping. But the risk of a second spike would be because of these clampets that are running about boozing, partying and barbecuing.A spokesperson for the Department for Communities said that they have now contacted Mr Hutchinson directly about his case.Meanwhile, the Stormont Executive have agreed that those who are shielding will be able to go outdoors again by June the R number, used to estimate the spread of the virus, is still below one when ministers meet on Thursday.This will allow those affected to go outside with one member of their household while maintaining social distancing. The restriction has already been lted for vulnerable people in England and Wales.Belfast Most ReadDerry twins Aoe and Adamsaw beloved dad die from a massive heart attack at  ... now their mum wants you to send them a birthday card to help heal their griefCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Swann warns lockdown #not a holiday# as he announces £.m support for care homes, NI workers may be exempt from UK#s -day air travel quarantine ruleMcDonald#s opens two NI restaurants for drive-thru and deliveryFive people including child in hospital after Co Antrim car and tractor crash,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Minister Dodds said:“Covid- has presented an unprecedented challenge for our tourism industry, as it has for tourism markets around the world. “I believe the time is right to provide the tourist accommodation sector with clarity about opening dates. “I want to build upon the positive progress in managing the spread of the virus and begin to re-open our tourism industry in a safe and managed way.” The key dates agreed by the Executive today for re-opening tourist accommodation are:  July  – holiday andhome parks caravan sites self-catering properties. As they are self-contained and may require less advance notice before opening, the opening times for these types of accommodation may be advanced to earlier than  July depending on scientic advice July  – guesthouses guest accommodation BBs hotels hostels. The Tourism Steering Group will be asked to work with the sector to explore what facilities and amenities can safely be made available by hotels and recommendations will be brought to the Executive in due course.The Minister did stress, however, that progress on re-opening will depend on controlling the rate of transmission of the virus. googletag.cmd.push She said:“These dates are conditional on the continued containment of the spread of Covid-.” Further work is under way to assess the potential to re-open pubs and restaurants and all other parts of the tourism sector. The Minister continued:“Tourist accommodation will operate in a new, and challenging, world when it begins to emerge from Covid-. “We need to enable businesses to plan ahead to ensure social distancing and hygiene practices are in place and staff are trained. These practices will also be essential to reassure customers and employees that establishments are Covid- safe. “Enabling accommodation businesses to generate essential revenue will help to protect iniduals and livelihoods which support families and communities across Northern Ireland.” googletag.cmd.push The Tourism Recovery Steering Group, which the Minister chairs, and its supporting Working Group, will take relevant UK safe working guidance and make it specic to NI as overarching tourism sector guidance. A safety charter mark is also being considered. The proposals have been informed by engagement with the tourism industry through the Tourism Recovery Working Group.

If you were writing a letter to Santa, asking for something your community is craving for right now, this is it. An array of goodness, colour and atmosphere. A hub of activity depicted to the very last detail by Christine, a retired art teacher. The love of her craft hasnt diminished one iota. Even the stanchions on the goalposts have been added, at the request of her husband Paddy, the clubs chairman, after he scanned over it for one last time. googletag.cmd.push Like families across the world, lockdown changed the shape of Christines week. The school runs have disappeared, caring for their grandchildren put to an end by a need for social distancing, her golf and helping around Lavey club also halted. “The club gates were locked up and I missed calling in there every day,” Christine commented. “Paddy could always have found an excuse to call in and attend to something or other. I enjoyed helping with reception duties and keeping our amazing facilities clean and tidy.” Until now. Updating her family photo albums is part of the new routine. When it was her turn to add to Damians collection, an football action photo set her creative mind wandering. googletag.cmd.push “He featured in a photograph taken by Mary K Burke for the County Derry Post. The high catch in this photograph inspired me to paint the ‘Love Our Club, Love Lavey’ painting,” Christine reveals. “I was old-school and when we grew up, we enjoyed the high catch – I just thought that was a fabulous skill and I liked that picture. “I was going to do a painting of that, but then I thought Ill do the whole club because we are missing the club. I put in the pitch and I just kept adding to it, I put the supporters in and I kept putting more and more detail into it. I really enjoyed doing it.” She took photos of the clubhouse and the pitch to help her with the overall scaling. “I was trying to capture the colour, excitement and special atmosphere of match days,” Christine explains. “The only part of the painting that is from an actual game is the high catch at midfield. The rest of the players and supporters are imagined, although I did model two of the younger supporters on Eimear and Aodhan my grandchildren, who are underage players and keen fans.” Her love and interest in sport isnt something recent. Christine, originally from Swatragh, is from the Quinn family steeped in the GAA. Her sisters Bernie , Patsyand Sarahanneall had distinguished camogie careers. The family was also immersed in Scoacuter, football and hurling. “My younger brothers, Roddy A, Adrian and Iggy, hurled for club and county. My older brother, Dickie, played senior football and for many years continued as a dedicated member of the thirds,” Christine explains. “GAA was a constant topic of conversation in our house and it continues to be so, with many of my nieces and nephews starring on club and county. “Sundays were always match days in Ballynian where I grew up,” she adds. The field at the back of the house was flat, goalposts were put up and the pitch was marked out and all. “Jim B Bradley and lots of cousins came over over, two teams were picked and we had some great games of football, hurling and camogie. “All the boys and girls played all codes. Sarahanne turned out to be the best hurler and camogie player and was always a first pick. “A highlight was mammy bringing out the plate of orange segments at half time. The sun always seemed to shine then and we have some great memories.” Christines artistic passion also grew. When the Far East magazine arrived at home, the colouring in competitions were done and sent away. “And the very few times, you would win something from it.” she remembers. “I was always interested in it, right from primary school.” Like many schools, reading, writing and arithmetic were the order of the day at the local St Johns in Swatragh, but when Maura McKenna came in as a student teacher in Primary , Christines love for art deepened even more. “We did art competitions, it was brilliant and I can remember it to this day – I really enjoyed it,” Christine said, with total enthusiasm. “I went to Loreto in Coleraine and it was such a fabulous place for anybody to go to, for anybody who was interested in art. “The art department was down at the road, in a lodge and was separate to the rest of the school. There were so many opportunities.” She was lucky to have TP Flanagan, who painted pieces for Seamus Heaney, as a tutor in St Mary’s Teacher Training College in Belfast. In , Christine joined the Art and Design Department in St Mary’s Grammar School, Magherafelt, where she was popular with her pupils, one of whom remarked how she was always smiling, an example of someone revelling in their job. BBC Broadcaster Thomas Niblock is a past pupil and always remembers Christines first words when he stepped into the school in first year. “Someday you will all travel the globe, make your way in the world and decorate your own homes,” she would tell them. “My job is to provide you all with a true appreciation of art and the joy it can bring,” Thomas remembers. “To a -year-old, that felt like million miles from where I was, but I remember her saying it. It stuck,” states Thomas. “Her teaching  percent instilled that appreciation and education that will stay with me for le. More importantly, a lovely human-being and it was a privilege to be taught by her.” Christine spent her teaching le in the school - over  very happy years, something she labels as a privilege. “To work with so many exceptional staff and students, I couldnt explain how happy I was going to work every day, the children were so talented and such lovely children to work with.” In retirement, art has certainly not being left to one side and she has painted many local settings, such as Moyola Park Golf Club and the recently refurbished Lavey chapel. As we talk on the phone, Christina is heading for her first round of golf in eight weeks. Her husband Paddy has been a member there all his le. “They did lessons for ladies four years ago. We have had great fun and we were the first ladies team to win an Ulster medal for Moyola.” In recent years, the painting hasnt been as plentul, but now she is back in full flow. “I particularly enjoy painting with oils and have previously painted many scenes in my locality, including local homesteads, local bars and places of interest. “I knew I wanted to include our amazing clubhouse in the composition, Christine said of her most recent masterpiece. “I miss the excitement and camaraderie of match days and I tried to capture that by adding players and supporters. I took a few photographs of the pitch and the clubhouse. “The weather was kind and I set my easel outside the back of the house. It was really enjoyable getting the oil paints out and painting outside, while listening to my favourite album, Neil Diamond’s ‘OriginalHot August Night’ from .” It was a work of art and a labour of love, all rolled into one. Not one to be rushed. A glance at the images around this feature showcases the level of detail required to fully depict a scene. Doing it justice is the most important thing. “It seemed to take forever - the painstaking level of detail required me to use tiny, No , paintbrushes,” she explains. “I thought I had it perfect and was ready to pack up my paints when Paddy came along and said where are the stanchions, so I had a little more to do. “Painting is such an enjoyable experience, especially at a time like this when you have lots of time on your hands - to start with a blank canvas, draw and paint and create something.” Christine points to the other people in the locality and their creative side. Drawings, paintings, sketches, poems, songs and stories have all been produced depicting their Love for Lavey. “In Lavey, we are incredibly proud of that group in our community who got together  years ago and built our state-of-the-art facilities,” Christine adds. “Everyone in the parish benefits from the healthy lestyle that Erin’s Own Club and Termoneeny Community association has to offer and the friendships that develop there too.” She points to the minors winning the football and hurling double, a group that added an Ulster football title – giving great hope for the future. “We look forward to the day when our weekly activities all begin again, the walking, cycling and running groups,” Christine concludes. “Mary’s baby massage and yoga classes, Thomasina’s mindfulness sessions, Parish events, Mary’s Young at Heart groups, local PS events, local schools coaching and competitions, Anne’s yoga and spinning sessions, Darragh and Katrina’s circuits.” A litany of a le currently on hold. When Lavey parish s from the wilderness, the characters in Christines paintings will burst back into le, all in the perfect colour in which they have been depicted. Love your community. Love your club. Love Lavey. RELATED - Derry clubs leaving a legacy during lockdown. More...

However, concern has been raised about a group of young people who are harassing workers on the site. The construction of the new centre had to be stopped because of the lockdown restrictions. However, work has now recommenced following the easing of some aspects of the restrictions. A spokesperson for Shantallow Community Centre, however, said it was important that the contractors were allowed to get on with the project in peace. Unfortunately they are being harassed by a handful of local young people, the spokesperson said. googletag.cmd.push I am asking all parents and any adults to make a point of walking through the Donkey Field - community centre area when you can - out doing their daily exercise, walking the dog or just to check the site. This centre belongs to you. Don’t let a handful of people spoil it.

The Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, Rt RevAndrew Forster, joined scores of parishioners from the Parish of St Augustine’s and further afield for the service at Bishop Street car park in the city centre on Sunday morning to mark Pentecost Day. The service,which took place in glorious sunshine,was led by the Rector of St Augustines - ‘The Wee Church on the Walls’ -Rev Nigel Cairns. The car park adjoins St Augustine’s Parish Hall and is opposite the city’s courthouse. A team of volunteers, dressed in ‘high-vis’ vests and PPE gear, oversaw a one-way, ‘car ferry’ type system, that meant cars were directed in one entrance and out bya dferent route after the service. googletag.cmd.push Social-distancing guidelines required all those present to remain in their cars during worship, and parish volunteers ensured that none of the worshippers fell victim to the soaring temperature. Bishop Andrew, who preached the sermon,welcomed the congregation to what he called his ‘back garden’ . He said: St Augustine’s was known as ‘the Wee Church on the Walls’. Today, we’re the wee church without walls. I always think about St Augustine’s as the wee Church with a big heart and today we’re showing our big heart because we’re together, worshipping God on this Pentecost Sunday. googletag.cmd.push “This is definitely a first for me,” the Bishop said, “and I would imagine it’s a first for many of you as well, but God is here and we worship him in spirit and in truth.” Rev Cairns echoed Bishop Forster’s welcome to the first ‘Drive-through Church’ in the inner city, and thanked all those who had helped make the service possible. He said the St Augustine’s parishioners would be gathering for worship in the same location again next Sunday.

The ‘Day Today’ shop at the corner of Rathlin Gardens is known locally as Harry Doots, harking back to a previous owner of the shop. Now, a special mural has been created at the shop to mark this famous name. Patrick McCloskey, the current owner of the store, said he was delighted with the mural which celebrates the signicance of the shop to local residents over the decades. As well as Harry Doots shop, graffiti hotspots around Bishops Field, Central Drive, Cromore and Rathlin Gardens in Creggan have also been transformed into real works of art over the past week. googletag.cmd.push Karl Porter and Donal O’Doherty of the guerrilla street art group UV Arts teamed up with Creggan Enterprises and Creggan Neighbourhood Partnership , and with young people from the local area, to give the neighbourhood a facelt. CNP’s Tony O’Doherty said the clean-up of the lane behind the Creggan shops on Central Drive was very much appreciated by the local community. “Karl and Donal’s magnicent art-works have really given new le to the place,” he said. “These young artists are really to be commended. If we’re to frank about it, this work was long overdue, but it has transformed this area from a non-descript back lane into an outdoor urban gallery.” googletag.cmd.push The artists also worked with young people to create colourful new entrances for Bishop’s Field Paacuteirc an Easpaig. Conal McFeely of Creggan Enterprises said it was ‘entirely appropriate’ that one of the new murals at the facility would acknowledge and celebrate the potential of our young people. “It is very important that we pay tribute to the immense effort being done by young people - within families, the community and within the frontline services - during this Covid crisis. “There is an old Irish saying – ‘Mol an Oacuteige agus tiocfaidh siacute - Praise young people and they will flourish’, and this concept is now proudly emblazoned at the entrance to Bishop’s Field, thanks to Karl and Donal.” Local resident, Kitty McDaid, speaking on behalf of her neighbours, said: “We are over the moon with all the new artwork and the clean-up of the lane behind our homes, a massive thankyou to all involved.” Not far from Central Drive, at Cromore and Rathlin Gardens work was also carried out to clean up some of the most signicant areas. Using distinct themes, the artwork added a vibrant splash of colour to each area. Jim Brown, Creggan Community Collective, explained the signicance of the new artwork at Cromore. “People are pulling together at this time, the community are giving freely of their time and effort to help others. There is an understanding that what is required is “Solidarity… not Charity. “Creggan people are resilient, and have learned that we cannot simply rely on the state or anyone  to help us, we have the capacity to help ourselves.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The campaign, which is run by the Child Accident Prevention Trust, is taking place throughout this week – with advice, tips, guidance and interactive tools available from the CAPT website. Mayor Tierney said that he didnt hesitate in giving his backing to a cause that he knows is vitally important for families across the District. As a parent myself, I know that each and every mother, father andhas their childs safety as their number one priority at all times. googletag.cmd.push I also know that accidents can happen so easily and unexpectedly, and Child Safety Week is an initiative which offers us all useful advice on how we can take actions to prevent such incidents. Its fantastic to watch our children grow, and to see their curiosity and their desire to learn about everything around them, but sometimes that can lead to things like burns, scalds or even poisoning. Mayor Tierney continued: Of course, we all take steps to ensure that our child is never in danger, but its extremely dficult to foresee everything. The Child Accident Prevention Trust have done a fantastic job in putting together a host of tools and information that helps continue our education as parents and s about the dangers around us – particularly in this current period when, as families, we are spending a lot more time in our homes. googletag.cmd.push I would encourage everyone to avail on the resources available as we raise awareness during Child Safety Week.

Cathal Mallaghan of Sinn Feacutein was appointed as Chair at last night’s AGM and he told the County Derry Post how he hopes to get the local economy moving again. “Keeping people employed in work is going to be the number one issue. Without that you’ll see a lot of families struggling financially,” he said. “In one of the recent reports, its showed that Mid Ulster would be one of the hardest hit regions because we are heavily dependent on manufacturing, so there’s a big task there. googletag.cmd.push “It’s going to be an important time to support our local community groups and our businesses to try and get everybody back up and going and restarting the economy.” Cllr Mallaghan, a native of Pomeroy, Co Tyrone, is taking on the role for a third time. He previously acted as a presiding councillor in the council’s initial ‘shadow year’ and also assumed the role for a brief period following the co-opting of Linda Dillon to the NI Assembly. In what he describes as his first ‘proper’ year, he is hoping to continue the council’s reputation for building good working relationships. “There is a good relationship between the councillors and the senior management team,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “The senior management team, led by Anthony Tohill, have a good understanding of what the council wants and how they see things moving forward. “They have a good relationship with community groups and businesses on the ground, which is important when you’re trying to take projects forward. “The parties in Mid Ulster Council work well together too, although obviously there is going to be a dference of opinion on issues. “When it comes to supporting communities, or the likes of delivering the rural development programme, all the parties are on the same page and supportive of that kind of work.” Cllr Mallaghan praised the impact of community groups in the region and said he hoped to help Mid Ulster Women’s Group on an ambitious project. “Mid Ulster Women’s Aid want to build houses in Cookstown to further their work in protecting women who have been subject to domestic violence. “If I could do something in these  months to take that forward and get the council to work along with them, I think that would be a great achievement.” He also hopes to revisit the Maghera Public Realm Scheme and bring it to completion alongside similar projects in the region. He said: “We had three very successful schemes in Dungannon, Magherafelt and Cookstown which are completed, and Coalisland is almost finished. “Change is dficult for some people, particularly when you want to do what you can to improve our town centres, but I’m sure the Maghera scheme will be successful and people will be happy with it.” “It’s going to be a very unusual year as chair, because of the way things are with restrictions and everything . “Hopefully when the relaxations begin to take effect later in the year, we’ll start seeing a bit more normality again.” Other Sinn Feacutein councillors have also taken on key roles following the AGM. Brian McGuigan has become Chair of the Audit Committee, with Niall McAleer as Deputy Chair. Sean McPeake takes on the Chair of the Planning Committee, while John McNamee becomes Chair of the Development Committee, with Sean McGuigan and Catherine Elattar taking on Chair of the Environment Committee and Housing Council Representative respectively.

The meeting yesterday of the councils Governance and Strategic Planning Committee heard that the local authority is facing an estimated loss of pound.m for the   financial year because of the pandemic. This loss is a result of issues such as the closures of leisures facilities and museums, as well as money usually generated by the councils planning and building control departments. It was agreed at yesterdays meeting that the council should ask the government for more financial support. googletag.cmd.push The councils Lead Finance Officer, Alfie Dallas, presented a report to the meeting outlining the full extent of the financial problems facing the council. Mr Dallas said that the councils annual expenditure was poundm. He said that rates received from both business and domestic properties funded % of this expenditure. “This is obviously a very concerning and challenging position and one which, in the absence of signicant Government intervention, could have a signicant impact on Council services both during   and into subsequent financial years, with signicant challenges for the upcoming   rates process,” said Mr Dallas. “In line with the Local Government Finance Act, it is clear that as a result of COVID  and without signicant Government support, that reserves would be inadequate to fund Council services for the   financial year and place Council in an insolvent position.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Dallas outlined a number of steps the council had taken in a bid to mitigate the losses. This included securing an anticipated poundm from a fund set up by the government to help local governments through the coronavirus crisis. The council is also expected to save pound.m as a result of being able to temporarily lay off around  employees through the governments furlough scheme. Another pound.m has been secured to cover the costs of the council-owned City of Derry Airport until the end of this month. Mr Dallas said the proposed savings identied by the council came to almost poundm. However, he added that this would still leave the council with a remaining estimated deficit of pound.m for this financial year. Councillors at the meeting spoke about their concern that the current situation would have on the striking of rates in future years. Sinn Fein councillor Mickey Cooper said it was a very gloomy picture. He praised the councils financial management in recent years which had allowed it to build reserves which were helping the local authority through the current dficult period. Independent councillor Paul Gallagher described the situation as very scary and said he was really concerned at the rates outcome facing the council. He highlighted that many local businesses who pay rates to the council are not open and many of them will not have any income for a long period. Cllr Gallagher said any expected crash in terms of the rates income able to be generated by the council would have a serious impact on its operations. He proposed that the council write to the British Treasury asking it to subsidise the councils rates base for the next two years. He said this would allow businesses to build up their income to pre-coronavirus levels. DUP councillor Hilary McClintock said it was important to engage with government to look at ways of minimising the impact on local ratepayers. SDLP councillor Martin Reilly said it was likely that the full impact of the coronavirus on the councils finances would be seen in future years. Councillors agreed at the meeting to support Councillor Gallaghers proposal that the Treasury be asked to provide more financial support for the council.

The meeting yesterday of the councils Governance and Strategic Planning Committee heard that the local authority is facing an estimated loss of pound.m for the   financial year because of the pandemic. This loss is a result of issues such as the closures of leisures facilities and museums, as well as money usually generated by the councils planning and building control departments. It was agreed at yesterdays meeting that the council should ask the government for more financial support. googletag.cmd.push The councils Lead Finance Officer, Alfie Dallas, presented a report to the meeting outlining the full extent of the financial problems facing the council. Mr Dallas said that the councils annual expenditure was poundm. He said that rates received from both business and domestic properties funded % of this expenditure. “This is obviously a very concerning and challenging position and one which, in the absence of signicant Government intervention, could have a signicant impact on Council services both during   and into subsequent financial years, with signicant challenges for the upcoming   rates process,” said Mr Dallas. “In line with the Local Government Finance Act, it is clear that as a result of COVID  and without signicant Government support, that reserves would be inadequate to fund Council services for the   financial year and place Council in an insolvent position.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Dallas outlined a number of steps the council had taken in a bid to mitigate the losses. This included securing an anticipated poundm from a fund set up by the government to help local governments through the coronavirus crisis. The council is also expected to save pound.m as a result of being able to temporarily lay off around  employees through the governments furlough scheme. Another pound.m has been secured to cover the costs of the council-owned City of Derry Airport until the end of this month. Mr Dallas said the proposed savings identied by the council came to almost poundm. However, he added that this would still leave the council with a remaining estimated deficit of pound.m for this financial year. Councillors at the meeting spoke about their concern that the current situation would have on the striking of rates in future years. Sinn Fein councillor Mickey Cooper said it was a very gloomy picture. He praised the councils financial management in recent years which had allowed it to build reserves which were helping the local authority through the current dficult period. Independent councillor Paul Gallagher described the situation as very scary and said he was really concerned at the rates outcome facing the council. He highlighted that many local businesses who pay rates to the council are not open and many of them will not have any income for a long period. Cllr Gallagher said any expected crash in terms of the rates income able to be generated by the council would have a serious impact on its operations. He proposed that the council write to the British Treasury asking it to subsidise the councils rates base for the next two years. He said this would allow businesses to build up their income to pre-coronavirus levels. DUP councillor Hilary McClintock said it was important to engage with government to look at ways of minimising the impact on local ratepayers. SDLP councillor Martin Reilly said it was likely that the full impact of the coronavirus on the councils finances would be seen in future years. Councillors agreed at the meeting to support Councillor Gallaghers proposal that the Treasury be asked to provide more financial support for the council.

They are open from pm to pm, Monday to Friday.ldquoWhile we are open again we are operating under strict guidelines with one-ways systems in place, designated seating areas and a maximum of eight people in the church at any one time, he said.ldquoI had hoped to reintroduce a limited number of sacramentals such as confession and benediction in Kilcoo, as this parish have had very little in the way of services over the last few years due to a shortage of priests. However, diocesan officials have cautioned against it, just now.Fr McKinley, who has been parish priest at Kilmegan for ten years, continued: ldquoThe virus came upon us out to the blue.

I foresee it wonrsquot be any time soon before we are able to facilitate anything like that number, said Fr McKinley has had to reschedule  weddings and postpone First Communions and confirmations until later in the year.He added: ldquoIt is an eerie and uncomfortable feeling to celebrate Mass in an empty church and I long for the day we will see our churches full to capacity once more.ldquoHowever, while the obligation to attend Sunday Mass has been temporarily lted Masses are still available on the parish webcam for everyone to view.Magheradroll Church of Ireland Church in Ballynahinch will be open for one hour each Thursday, starting next week.Canon Warren Russell, rector, said: ldquoI welcome the reopening of the church in line with the recommendations made by the Northern Ireland Assembly.ldquoWe will open from am to noon on a Thursday which coincides with market day in the town.ldquoWe want to reassure people that all possible safety measures will be in place to facilitate the opening and provide a quiet space for prayer and reflection once again.ldquoThere will be masks, disposable gloves and hand sanitiser available at the back of the church for people to use.Canon Russell, who has been rector for the past  years, added: ldquoWe will measure the response and review it again in a few weeks.

But with the COVID- restrictions Irsquove decided to take the challenge on Zwt to avoid any risk of burdening the health service.Proceeds from the challenge will go to the mental health charities Aware and Ballynahinch Counselling Services, also known as The Hub.ldquoOur lives have been turned upside down with the COVID- pandemic and many people are finding it dficult to cope with the changes, health concerns and isolation of it all, Alan continued.ldquoMental health issues can affect anyone and looking after our mental health is key to our overall emotional and physical wellbeing.ldquoSo far Irsquove raised almost pound and would really like to get to pound.

We were told thathis injuries had been one centimetre one way or the other, it could have been a lot worst. There were terrible injuries but at least there was no injury to his head or spine head.ldquoIt was just a freak accident and hopefully nothing like this will ever happen again. However, Declan has told me that he will be back in the tractor as soon as he can walk.Mrs Keating said Declan had passed his tractor driving test late last year and was used to driving their tractor to her brotherrsquos nearby dairy farm.ldquoThe boys had set off from home and were literally just yards down the road when the accident happened,ldquo she continued. ldquoWe are not sure how but Declan said that one minute he was driving and the next he was flung out the side door onto the road and the tractor ran over him.ldquoThe tractor continued moving and Eoin managed to get it stopped and immediately checked on Declan and called his daddy.ldquoDeclan was fully conscious and realised he was badly injured. He checkedhis legs and arms worked. He thought that his pelvis was broken and wanted to seehe was paralysed and somehow managed to get himself up and walk over to the other verge before his legs gave way. He was sitting up when me and his father arrived at the scene.Mrs Keating said that while both Declan and Eoin were naturally shocked by what had happened, she was proud of both her sonsrsquo presence of mind during the horric accident.ldquoEoin called us  seconds after the accident and we were there within minutes, she said. ldquoDeclan was alert the whole time when the ambulance and paramedics arrived.Mrs Keating and her husband followed behind the ambulance as Declan was rushed to the RVH. An emergency doctor met the ambulance in Kircubbin before continuing on. However, the parents feared the worst when the ambulance pulled over at the tennis courts in Greyabbey.ldquoThe doctor jumped out of the ambulance and told us not to worry, Declan was OK. He was going to give him a blood transfusion as he was losing blood internally and the air ambulance was on its way. Literally, it seemed the helicopter arrived just seconds later and Declan was transferred by air then to the hospital.Mrs Keating said that the blood transfusion was vital to Declan at that time, adding: ldquoFor remote communities where we live, the air ambulance is an essential service. They only have started carrying blood supplies earlier this year. If he hadnrsquot have gotten the blood, he may not have been here.Declanrsquos injuries were found to be signicant. He sustained a broken pelvis, perforated bladder and bowel, a collapsed lung, three broken ribs, internal bleeding and bruising.Mrs Keating said: ldquoThe accident and emergency doctor said he would have expected anyone  to be in a critical condition with the range of injuries but Declan was in a serious condition which showed us what a fighter he was and he wasnrsquot letting it get the better of him. We took some comfort from this at that time.She said that three teams of specialist surgeons operated on Declan for more than eight hours to deal with his major injuries.ldquoThe surgeons were extremely worried about Declan and I kept askinghe was going to be OK. The surgeon would only say that he was out of immediate danger and that the next - hours would be critical, she said.Declan spent three nights in intensive care before moving into another ward. Mrs Keating said that the care Declan received was ldquofirst-class and spoke of how caring the medics were to their plight.ldquoDeclanrsquos father and I wanted to be with him through the night. At one point the ward sister called us over and offered us the sleep room the surgeons use for rest during their sht. They gave up that room for us for three nights so we could be with Declan and we saw just how busy they all were. We thank them from the bottom of our hearts for their kindness.The family say they were overwhelmed by the support and well wishes they received from their local community and their donations to the appeal.Mrs Keating added: ldquoDeclan will recover and he canrsquot wait to be up again at am every morning to help on the farm as he just loves the farming le. The air ambulance was the legacy of Dr John Hinds [the late emergency medicine specialist] and it would be remiss of me not to remember him and what he did for others during his le and his campaign to get the service. We are forever indebted to him and the air ambulance service for saving Declanrsquos le.ldquoRegarding farm accidents in Northern Ireland, we know we are one of the more fortunate families and we are so thankful. I hope people continue to give money as itrsquos a vital service for the whole of Northern Ireland.To donate go to www.justgiving fundraising eoin-keating..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C May 27%2C 2000  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH ndash Residents at a Ballynahinch housing estate are due to hold talks with a range of key officials this morning in a bid to raise the profile of the area.People from the Hillcrest Drive area in the town are due to meet with senior officials from the Housing Executive, Down Council and the Department of Environment.The meeting comes in the wake of recent vandalism attacks in the Windmill Street area which damaged a number of cars, homes and business properties.Prior to this morningrsquos meeting, residents met with local councillor Anne McAleenan to discuss their concerns and prepare for the crucial talks with the representatives of the statutory agencies.Last weekend, the local councillor discussed with residents their concerns and advised them to draw up a strategy and work closely with the ious agencies who could provide them with key assistance.One of the main concerns is an area at the top of Hillcrest Drive which residents would like to see the Department of Environment cleaning up to enhance the image of the area.In addition, residents are calling for environmental improvements and also believe sealing off the rear of the estate from the lough area could prevent trouble at weekends.KILLYLEAGH ndash The impact a young Killyleagh footballer is having on the international soccer stage was praised at Monday nightrsquos meeting of Down Council.Killyleagh councillor Sam Osborne highlighted the achievements of  year-old David Healy who marked his Northern Ireland debut with a brace against Luxembourg and another strike against Malta.Mr Osborne said the young Manchester United star was a great ambassador for the area and last week received the international personality of the year award at the annual Northern Ireland soccer writers awards sponsored by Guinness.The local councillor said Healyrsquos success for Manchester United and the Northern Ireland team was a great boost for the area.ARDGLASS ndash An Ardglass couple are waging a war against hostile waters in an attempt to circumnavigate Ireland for charity.Rhonda and Vincent Kearney set sail in their -foot boat, Invinceable, on Saturday to make their way around Ireland in a bid to raise pound, to help buy a new leboat.And while the duo is no stranger to challenge, both sailors admit they face a fearsome feat.Vincent is a former Red Arrow and a stunt motorcyclist, while his we, Rhonda, is the former British clay pigeon shooting champion, but nothing, they say, could prepare them for the journey they are now making.ldquoWe only concocted the plan three months ago and thought we had better act quickly before we have time to think about what we are letting ourselves in for, said Vincent.ldquoI have been sailing on and off for about  years and have owned boats for quite some time, but it will still be extremely dficult, particularly with the dreadful weather forecasts we have been given.

Even so, there is a palpable sense of joy among the golfing fraternity.St Patrickrsquos Golf Club in Downpatrick resumed last Wednesday and the captain, Robert McCausland, said he ldquowas absolutely delighted.ldquoThe club is very pleased to be up and running again, he remarked.ldquoWe are very grateful to our green keepers who continued with their work during the lockdown and have delivered a golf course in magnicent condition for the members to enjoy.Mr McCausland said the club was now open to new members and that there were a ldquonumber of very attractive offers in place for those who may wish to take up the game of golf.He added: ldquoThe time sheets over the last few days are quite full and the car park has been busy with lots of smiling, happy faces about the club.Wednesday also saw the reopening of Ardglass Club and Paul Vaughan, the clubrsquos director of golf, said the course has been full up ever since.ldquoOur members have been playing in three-balls and going off every  minutes. We havenrsquot had a spare space since we re-opened, he said.ldquoEveryone is delighted to be back and itrsquos great to see so many people about. I think our members were glad to get out of the house and back on to the golf course.ldquoWe have a marshal at the front gate and the members are obeying the all the guidelines so that they can play casual golf.Mr Vaughan said the loss of visitors represented the loss of a major source of income for the club, but hoped this would be offset by new members.ldquoWe have had a lot of enquiries about new members, but visitorsrsquo green fees are a huge part of our business, he said.ldquoHopefully, we will be able to salvage something towards the end of the season and things willto something near normal next year.At Spa Golf Club, near Ballynahinch, which re-opened on Friday, the captain, Gordon Martin said everyone was ldquoexcited at the expectation of getting back playing in a sport we love so much.He went on: ldquoI am very aware of the sacrices many people have made in our communities that allows us to get to this point. May I on behalf of Spa Golf Club members and their families thank all the heros in out communities.ldquoSpa recognises the great responsibility golf has in being one of the first sports to re-open after the lockdown and fully intends to adhere to all the protocols agreed by our governing body.He said the club had been fortunate to be able to keep some greens staff working at the club over the lockdown period.ldquoThe driest April on record put extra burdens on green keeping staff in terms of additional watering and essential maintenance. But we are pleased to say the course is looking just magnicent.Mr Martin also said it has been a dficult period from a financial point of view with not many golf clubs being eligible for any signicant assistance under the ious Covid finance packages.Bright Castle Golf Club, which is privately owned by the Ennis family, has also been busy since it re-opened last Thursday.ldquoThe course is looking magnicent and the members are enjoying it, said Linda Ennis.ldquoItrsquos been a tough few months, but wersquove worked hard to keep the course maintained to a high standard and itrsquos really looking the part.ldquoThe members are glad to be out playing and itrsquos great to see so many happy faces.ldquoThe last time the course was closed this long was about six or seven years ago and that was because of heavy show. It was a bit disheartening having the place empty in April and earlier this month when the weather was lovely.She added: We rely on visitors and societies for a good portion of our income, but we have had enquiries about new memberships, which is good news for us.Crossgar Golf Club president Paddy Bell heaped praise on the clubrsquos green keeping staff for having the course in great shape and also revealed there has been a surge in new members.ldquoWe have had a big uptake in new members in the past few weeks, which will help compensate for the lack of green fees, he said.ldquoWe re-opened last Wednesday and itrsquos fantastic to see people playing again. It gives you hope that everything may soonto normality.ldquoThe course is in great condition and thatrsquos due to the green keeping staff who have worked hard during the lockdown. All praise is due them.Temple Golf Club has also been inundated with membership enquiries. Since it re-opened last week it has welcomed  new junior members.Owner Tim Martin said the pandemic lockdown couldnrsquot have come at a worse time with membership subions due on April .ldquoAs like every other club, our income disappeared overnight. We depend heavily on the income from the restaurant and bar and our cash flow dwindled rapidly, Mr Martin said.ldquoWe were only able to continue paying our staff each week because of some of the loyal members who paid their fees on time. To them we are very grateful. This kept us ticking over until the government job retention scheme kicked in.Mr Martin said the members had been very accommodating and were adhering to the guidelines and protocols.ldquoWe look forward to progressing into the next stage, but will have to make sure it will be financially viable to open the restaurant and bar when the time comes, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Loughinisland man Gerry praises Move More initiative  ","story":"THERE are not many who have been to the top of the majestic Efel Tower in France.But Loughinisland man Gerry Morgan is one of the lucky few who have made it to the summit to snatch a birdrsquos eye view of the stunning Parisian landscape.That was  years ago when he opted for the easy option by popping into the lt and by-passing the , steps.

We also do sit-ups and squats.After the exercise regime it is time for a coffee and a chat, which all the Move More participants thoroughly enjoy.ldquoWe are literally one big family as many of us have been through cancer and fortunately come out the other side. In a way, illness has brought us together, continued Gerry.But everything changed in March when the arrival of the coronavirus forced Newry, Mourne and Down Council to close all its leisure centres and public buildings.To keep everyone involved, Laura mdash one of  Move More coordinators funded by Macmillan in every council area across the province to support those living with cancer mdash created an app to enable people to keep in touch remotely and exercise at home.She also recently unveiled a new initiative encouraging people living with cancer to virtually climb their way around some of the worldrsquos top landmarks to stay active during the coronavirus pandemic, without leaving the comfort of their own homes.Laura said that while Move More members were not able to physically travel the world at the moment, there was no limit to their imagination.Participants were given the choice of a number of buildings to scale, including Londonrsquos imposing Big Ben.Not surprisingly, Gerry opted to head back to the top of the Efel Tower, only this time he didnrsquot have to leave his front door during the virtual challenge. He set off at a leisurely pace and over three days and, with a little je nous said quoi, made it to the top.ldquoI could have completed the climb in two days, but decided to do it over three instead, he joked. ldquoI really enjoyed doing it, but miss being with my Move More friends.Gerry is pleased that while face-to-face classes and appointments are not possible, Laura has been working on positive, fun and interesting ways to keep programme participants motivated and active in the comfort of their own surroundings.He is also looking forward to getting back to the Down Leisure Centre when it is safe to do so and the pandemic is no more.Recalling the first time he went to the centre following his referral, Gerry admits that he was a little apprehensive.ldquoI distinctly remember driving to Downpatrick and was so nervous that I almost turned the car around to go back home, he said. ldquoBut I continued on and am so glad that I did. It has been an overwhelmingly positive experience for me, one that I thoroughly enjoy.ldquoI was a bit down for a few years after losing my lung and the chemotherapy, but getting involved with the Move More programme changed everything.

are recommending that a proposal for a major new housing development comprising  new homes at an  acre site on the outskirts of Ballynahinch should proceed.Their recommendation to approve plans for a mixed development comprising a range of detached, semi detached and townhouses on the Lisburn Road will be discussed at next weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Planning Committee.This particular committee has not met since March as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and to comply with social distancing requirements, the planning meeting will be held at Newry Leisure Centre next Wednesday.In papers submitted ahead of the meeting, the proposed development site mdash which comprises a number of fields mdash is described as ldquoirregular in shape, with the recently constructed Lime Trees, Edengrove and Kinedale developments in close proximity.Planners say that the site earmarked for the new homes is located on the ldquoinner edge of Ballynahinchrsquos development limits, with the area zoned for housing in the Down Area Plan.It is also confirmed in the planning papers that initially, plans were lodged to build  homes, but the figure was subsequently revised after planners expressed concern.The Department for Infrastructure is also content that the proposed housing scheme can be accommodated within the existing roads network.Northern Ireland Water said there is available capacity within the existing sewerage system to cope with the planned new homes, while planning permission has been granted for a new sewage pumping station on adjacent land.The papers indicate that the planning application was submitted in March  and that a number of objections to the proposed development were lodged.Other objections to the proposed housing scheme centre around traffic and access arrangements, claims that the application had not been properly advertised and insufficient neighbourhood notication.Objectors also pointed to the lack of a so-called planting buffer and the ldquolack of effort to integrate an open space area adjacent Ballynahinch River into the proposed development.Another objector highlighted the schemersquos ldquoinappropriate density, arguing that it is greater than other developments closer to the town.The detail of a noise impact assessment submitted to planners has also been questioned, but Newry Mourne and Down Council environmental health officials have expressed satisfaction with the document.The planning papers reveal that an acoustic mound has been incorporated in to the proposed development, with landscaped proposed throughout to mitigate any noise impact on adjacent land uses.In addition, the papers confirm that there is a Tree Preservation Order covering the site and while a number of trees have already been felled, this issue is the subject of an enforcement case.Planners say the proposed development is ldquoappropriate to the character and topography of the site and that ldquoadequate provision is made for public and private open space and landscaped areas as an integral part of the development.They also state that where appropriate, planted areas of discrete groups of trees will be required along site boundaries ldquoin order to soften the visual impact of the development and assist in its integration with the surrounding area, with adequate provision made for parking.Planners say that the development will not have an ldquounacceptable, adverse effect on existing or proposed properties in terms of overlooking, loss of light, overshadowing, noise or other disturbance.Next weekrsquos planning committee meeting takes place two days after the local authorityrsquos annual meeting when it is expected that Rowallane councillor, Robert Burgess, will be

However, signs will be in place advising people where it is not safe to swim.The politicians say that council staff will be on duty at beaches, country parks and harbours to ensure required social distancing measures are adhered to. In addition, the number of visitors at the ious facilities will also be monitored, with staff carrying out regular cleaning duties.Cllr Clarke confirmed that local authority staff will be present to engage with the public around guidelines on social distancing and facility information.He said: ldquoWhile these measures will no doubt be welcomed, I would encourage people to be responsible and show consideration for others by continuing to follow the public health guidelines on social distancing and hand hygiene.Cllr Walker said the past two months have been particularly dficult for people across the district.ldquoIt has not been easy and we all hope that people will act responsibly when the beaches, country parks and harbours are reopened. The onus is on them to obey the rules in place which are designed to keep them safe and help prevent the spread of the virus, he continued.Cllr Walker said there were plans to put one-way systems in place, where appropriate, but that all public toilets would remain closed.He added: ldquoI hope that over the coming weeks other facilities will reopen. The fact that we can open beaches and country parks is as a result of local peoplersquos commitment to stay at home to prevent the spread of coronavirus.ldquoWe are making progress and for that to continue it is essential that people continue to adhere to public health advice.

I help my clients achieve their goals by finding that balancebetween nutrition, diet, and exercise.ldquoSome clients, and a lot of men actually, have come to me with problems with anxiety and gut health. For everyone to look after their gut health is something Irsquom verypassionate about.ldquoLast week was Mental Health Awareness Week and I would like people to understand the connection thatwe are feeding our bodies processed food, it can directly impact on our brains and our mental health.Apart from working on her own health and studying to understand what diet and nutrition works for her mdash shersquos vegetarian and stays away from grains, apart from oats and barley mdash Stacey was heavily influenced by holistic approach to health during her late fatherrsquos illness.Mr John Murtagh died in  at the age of  after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer.He was initially told that he has only six months to live and Stacey and her family believe that he helped extend his le through his devotion to nutrition, juicing, mediation and his deepreligious faith.ldquoOnce we heard the news, we researched everything we could to help him nutritionally and holistically, explained Stacey. ldquoWe believe  per cent his faith and his dedication to nutrition and meditation was definitely pertinent to his added time with us. His oncologists thought he was a miracle.ldquoI think it was through what we experienced with my father and my own journey that I knew I wanted to help others nutritionally and how to find their inner happiness and peace.In , she and her brother, Jonathon, climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in memory of her dad to raise nearly pound, for Marie Curie.Staceyrsquos own gut health problems were finally diagnosed while she was working in Dubai where she was able to avail of private health service through her job.ldquoI eventually found out that I have visceral hypersensitivity which is typical of IBS and means that the nerves endings in my intestines are exasperated by stress, she said.ldquoMy doctor was very interested in holistic therapies and when he found out that I was doing a lot of HITT [high intensity interval training] but still not losing weight, he recommended switching to lower intensity training such as yoga and Pilates. The dference it has made to my le, along with yoga and a balanced nutritional diet had been incredible.According to Stacey, an open mind and a willingness to test out certain foods to see what triggers your condition are essential for clients to get the right outcome.ldquoJust traditional medicine alone ndash and I would never encourage anyone not to go with traditional medicine ndash is not always the answer. Itrsquos a partnership approach with traditional side and holistic. But most importantly its listening to your own body and what feels right, said Stacey.ldquoClients need to bring a huge trust in the coaching and we really need to work between three to six months and delve quite deep into the personrsquos le to see how we can work together.ldquoIrsquom a big advocate for staying away from fad diets mdash they never worked for me. I believe you have to work to be happy and content within yourself and this is helped by making the right lestyle choices for yourself. Itrsquos about finding balance and what works for you as an inidual and settling into that lestyle.After having a fixed-term contract as a marketing manager before the lockdown, Stacey is no longer working and thinks that this might be the time to push through with yoga and heath coaching full-time.While offering free online yoga classes , Stacey is also offering a complimentary -minute health coaching interview.For further information visit www. staceymurtagh..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Supporters’ club members select their favourite Man Utd team  ","story":"LOCAL Manchester United fans have picked their favourite Reds team of the Premier League era.Members of the Downpatrick Manchester United Supportersrsquo Club were asked to pick their favourite players since the start of the Premier League in .They were tasked with selecting a best eleven along with five subs.

Please try again later.Submitting...He always knew he had been adopted, but it wasn’t until he was a teenager that he realised he was a foundling. At the newspaper archives in Belfast, David looks at the newspaper articles from the time. David realises he was  days old when he was found: “So this means that for the first couple of weeks of my le someone fed me, clothed me, kept me warm, loved me. Someone genuinely cared.” When David learns he has a full sister who was also abandoned as a baby, he says: “It’s dficult to take it in that the same thing had happened to me happened to my sister. That’s shocking. Why do our parents make the decision to leave us  It’s happened once, so why make the decision again ”David now lives in Birmingham with his we and their three children. He also has four grown up daughters.Helen lives in Navan. She has a son and two daughters.The pair met for the first time in a guest house in Carlingford. David comments: “The only sad thing for me ispolice had been able to put two and two together at the time we could have grown up together. She’s been deprived a brother and I’ve been deprived of a wee sister.”The programme concludes dramatically as Davina McCall reveals to David and Helen the identity of the pair’s parents.Their father was a married Protestant from Dublin who was having an affair with their mother, an unmarried Catholic from Kerry.Their father had  other children with his we before David and then Helen were born out of the affair which spanned many years.David said that their parents dferent religions and the fact the babies were born out of wedlock might have been why they were abandoned.The first part of Long Lost Family: Born Without Trace was shown last night. The second part is on tonight at pm on ITV.It focuses on foundlings – people abandoned as babies, often in the first hours and days of their lives. Born without trace, with no identying information, they have had no way of unlocking the secrets of their past. In the new ground-breaking series the team behind Long Lost Family combine the latest DNA technology with painstaking detective work, to enable four foundlings to uncover their identities.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

This is most evident in my baking, and in particular my annual attempt to create a birthday cake for my son.The discipline requires patience, precision, and a certain delicacy of touch. I possess none of these. I am not suited to the art, like a baby elephant trying to play the harpsichord.The malaise is compounded by the fact that, in an effort to please my boy, I attempt cakes beyond my modest skills. There was the pirate ship cake which sank without trace, the superhero cake which was powerless, the tiered cake which succumbed to gravity and the Halloween cake which was scary for all the wrong reasons.This year’s challenge, set many months ago, is a dinosaur cake. I have been thinking about the task for some time, and, perhaps persuaded that thorough preparation will improve the outcome, I have become more optimistic than experience has taught me is wise. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...I have selected a T-Rex cake which requires complicated assembly. For several weeks I have been gathering all of the required ingredients and studying techniques. During the day, when I should be working, I have often found my mind wandering towards the processes of cake construction. At nighttime, when sleep eludes me, baking fills my thoughts.And so, on the eve of my son’s birthday, I begin.And immediately it begins to go wrong.The batteries on my kitchen scales fail. Exactitude is everything in baking and I’m left guessing quantities based on judgment. My previous optimism is quickly replaced by the familiar low feeling of imminent failure as the mixture goes into the oven.Worse follows. Despite a liberal pre-greasing, the risen cake refuses to come out of the mould, leaving me desperately scrabbling and scratching at the sides of the tin to loosen it.Eventually the cake exits the tin. Or, to be more accurate, some of it does, because much of the top layer which represents the detail of the T-Rex is left behind.As I try to balance the cake on a wooden board, cracks begin to appear and it seems that large chunks may be about to separate, sort of like a sweet and spongy version of continental drt.The ghosts of past baking disasters are now vivid. I have no choice but to move forward. I have to try and decorate the wretched, misshapen dinosaur.I have determined that I will make icing and buttercream. Then I will add food colouring to create dferent shades, to give the cake definition.It goes well at first. And then it doesn’t.The consistency is all wrong and I can’t master the colours that I want. I watched a YouTube video about making and colouring icing and was struck by the sheen and brilliance of the end product. My icing is pallid and dull, asit has been through the digestive system of a cat.Despite this, I proceed, applying icing to the edges of the cake with all the delicacy of a rough-handed navvy.It is the use of the icing piping bag which almost breaks me. I struggle to find any adequate method of getting the buttercream into the little cone-shaped bag. Then, when I finally get to the point of squeezing the bag, the contents come out the top rather than the bottom. There is some fine icing applied, to be sure, but unfortunately it is upon my arm rather than the cake.My long-held intention of piping fine little green stars onto the T-Rex is quickly abandoned. I lower my ambition to just getting any buttercream onto the surface. It is very much like a severely inebriated man who can’t locate the light switch in the bathroom trying to put toothpaste onto his toothbrush.I have bought lots of brightly coloured chocolate sprinkles which I use to try and cover up some of the worst excesses of the damage. It does not work.Earlier I had printed out a photograph of the cake which I wanted to replicate and kept it beside me as a guide while I worked. I look at the photo now, then back at my creation. Is it vaguely recognisable as a T-Rex  Perhaps so,only from the exact moment when the asteroid landed on it.The further I go with this the worse I feel. Once again I have embarrassed myself and let my son down. It pricks a feeling within me which is never too far from the surface that I cannot do anything right. That I am bound to contaminate anything I touch. That my choices are always the wrong ones.The introspection gives way to a feeling closer to desolation and dark questions. What will people think  Why bother trying anything when I am bound forever to fail  And then, the one which is as constant as my shadow, wouldn’t it be betterI wasn’t here at all I’m nibbling at my fingernails as my son enters the room and climbs onto a chair to see what I am doing. He notices the creation and gasps.‘Wow daddy! That is so cool!’He glances at the photo of the perfect cake, and then back at my T-Rex.‘Yours is better daddy, much better. It’s the best cake I’ve ever seen!’He hugs me and, at once, I know that I have all the answers that I need. He runs off excitedly to tell mummy, leaving me pondering how easily I can be pulled in one direction, then the other. I’m reminded once again of the importance of seeing the world through other people’s eyes, of not just listening to the voices inside my own head, that there is more than one narrative to le. A hug and an encouraging word can turn a rough experience into something very dferent.Getting through tough days is a lot like baking a cake – it might not turn out the way that you had hoped, it might get messy, but at the end of it all it can still taste delicious.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

AntrimBT ETNorthern Ireland+   mail@presseyeOn Tuesday the News Letter reported that Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill’s Stormont department is making no attempt to recoup any of the £,-a-year paid to Mr Johnston while a special advisorto the first minister – despite the revelation that he was running crucial aspects of the DUP while taxpayers employed him as a temporary civil servant.Documents released by the RHI Inquiry show that in an email to former DUP health minister Jim Wells in September , Mr Johnston described himself as the “line manager” of the DUP’s chief spin doctor John Robinson, who happens to be his brother-in-law.Leaked emails give an insight into how his power ranged across the DUP, approving everything from the design of election posters, to clearing election literature and party advertising, to handling quotations for the purchase of party equipment and even dealing with requests for holiday leave from staff in DUP headquarters.Mr Wells said that he remembered the email and did not think it out of the ordinary because it was widely understood that Mr Johnston was essentially running the party for the leader as a joint “party enforcer and spad”. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

By September, he said it “became quite clear that I wasn’t ing” and he began “bending the ear of John Robinson”.During that process, he said that “a dispute arose between us because I was asserting the fact I should have been ing and he was saying ‘no, you’re not’. It got quite heated and I questioned John Robinson’s right to have a say in this issue.“Then Timothy Johnston intervened and sent me an email stating very clearly that he was John Robinson’s line manager and therefore essentially he was acting with his full authority.”Initially, Mr Johnston told the RHI Inquiry that there was not a hierarchy of DUP spads, but eventually conceded – after evidence from multiple other witnesses to the contrary – that he was in fact more powerful than other spads.Mr Wells, who lost the DUP whip two years ago amid a dispute with the leadership, said: “I have never seen one inidual exercise as much power in a political party. Not a blade of grass that has grown in the DUP garden in the last  years has not been planted, tended and manicured by Timothy Johnston.”He said that Mr Johnston – who is now the party’s chief executive – is “extremely hard working and intelligent but micromanages everything in the DUP he acts as chief spad, chief executive and chief whip of the DUP”.The South Down MLA said that “the benefit of RHI was that the lid was lted partially and you saw just how powerful he was – but you are only seeing a slight glimpse of a man who exercises power to an extent that Cummings must be envious”. When asked why he had not spoken out about the issue until falling out of favour with the party hierarchy, Mr Wells said: “If you’d spoken out against Timmy Johnston, your le wouldn’t have been worth living” and that “people fear Timmy Johnston”.Neither the DUP nor Mr Johnston responded to Mr Wells’ comments.—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

If successful, the global public health value of this trial result would be immense given the low cost and availability of this medicine.Early on in the pandemic, there was controversy over the use of ibuprofen after a French health minister advised against the use of it.Scientists in Britain launched a review to assess ties to the drug and Covid-.The Commission on Human Medicinesrsquo expert working group concluded: ldquoThere is currently insufficient evidence to establish a link between use of ibuprofen and susceptibility to contracting Covid- or the worsening of its symptoms..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Ibuprofen to be tested as treatment to reduce Covid- symptom article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

a special delivery of a food pack to Bro Thomas Alderdice in Kilkeel : Other rd PartyDistrict and private lodges have provided food hampers for its own members and other vulnerable people in the community, donated to frontline NHS staff, raised cash for charity and boosted PPE provision in the area.Right Worshipful Brother Denis Watson, county grand master, said: “The money we’ve raised has gone towards assisting all communities and, as the largest community-based organisation within Co Armagh, it shows that the institution is so much more than just a parading body and has had a very positive impact in all areas of the county.“Almost as soon as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic became known and lockdown was implemented, the  district lodges and many private lodges in Co Armagh made spontaneous and impressive efforts to assist in their local communities.Rt Wor Bro Denis Watson, County Grand Master, and Wor Bro Jeffrey Lawson, Deputy County Grand Secretary, presenting

charities, and providing PPE to nursing homes and community nursing services.A substantial donation of £, was made to the Southern Health and Social Care Trust, specically for Craigavon Area

building and encouraged young people to send in rainbow pictures for display on the front windows of the premises. “The County Grand Lodge central committee has been able to liaise by having regular Zoom conference meetings and this has proved very beneficial in maintaining contact and co-ordination.” Reflecting on the work he said: “It’s a very commendable effort by the Orange brethren of Co Armagh and of course this is being replicated in other counties within the jurisdiction of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\"

During my term we will move from response to recovery.“There will be much work for us as we navigate a path forward to help rebuild our communities and our economy.“I have no doubt that we will rise to these challenges and, working together, we will overcome them.“I look forward to working with all councillors and officers in this coming year and wish to pay tribute to the outgoing Mayor and Deputy Mayor Councillors Mealla Campbell and Margaret Tinsley.“My chosen charity for the year will be Macmillan Cancer Support and I look forward to dedicating my fundraising efforts to support the sterling work they do right across our Borough and beyond.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The outdoor wedding, the first to take place in the district since the introduction of restrictions in relation to COVID-, was also the first wedding to ever take place in the award winning Council public park. The sun shone on Julie and David as they made their vows in Grange Park to become the new Mr and Mrs Hannaway with the ceremony conducted by Fermanagh and Omagh District Council Registrar, Hazel Alderdice. Speaking about the ceremony, the Councils Registrar, Hazel, said: It was an absolute joy to officiate at Julie and Davids wedding in Grange Park. With the introduction of COVID- restrictions in March, many weddings within the district were cancelled or postponed which was obviously very distressing for all those involved. Following the easing of restrictions in relation to outdoor civil ceremonies the Council applied to have Grange Park listed as an approved venue for outdoor ceremonies so that those wishing to get married at a Council venue within the district could choose between Enniskillen Castle and Grange Park. Grange Park proved to be a lovely location for the wedding and we would like to extend our very best wishes to the new Mr and Mrs Hannaway. Speaking after the wedding ceremony, the new Mrs Hannaway expressed her thanks to the Councils Registrars for their help in arranging the service saying, We are so happy it came together so well. Following the easing of COVID- restrictions, outdoor weddings can take place currently with a maximum of six people in attendance. The Councils Registration Service has been receiving a number of enquiries from couples in relation to having an outdoor wedding since the easing of some restrictions, said Hazel. Our Registrars are pleased to offer information and advice to couples on planning their wedding at this time and we now look forward to conducting more weddings within the district over the coming months, Hazel added.
