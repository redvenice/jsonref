The Royal Wedding hits and misses by LIZ JONESThere were no real clangers on the big day. No outrageous hats from Eugenie and Beatrice. No outrageous bottoms threatening to eclipse the bride. There were only two slight faux pas: Amal Clooney threatened to outshine the sun, and the mother of the bride wore mint while the Queen chose lime: almost, almost a colour clash.On the whole, the female guests – particularly the Royals – had put in time and effort to get it right, and had clearly been poring over the springsummer catwalk photos to make sure they were all bang on trend. Hence, there was lots of asymmetric tailoring on show, so much so many assumed Windsor had been built on a hill. The HITS              Pippa Middleton in a £495 print by British label The Fold.

The length of skirts proved problematical: either a tad too short, a la Eugenie and Joss Stone, or midi length, which looks great on teenage supermodels but a little droopy drawers on normal women.Not too many gloves on show: the Duchess of York, a surprise hit on the day, was a rare fan, with a short navy pair, and the Queen, of course, wore hers.Hats were all proper structures, and not half-baked fascinators. And, thank the Lord, on such a hot day there were plenty of pretty open shoes displaying toe cleavage: not possible if the ceremony had taken place in a cathedral.Heels, though, were as high as the sun in the sky.Rumour has it slippers were handed out later for those who could no longer teeter after yet another glass of champagne             Amal Clooney chose a marigold dress by Stella McCartney with a bow at the back and a train            Singer Joss Stone sported shorter hair and swapped her hippy look for a girly print            Carole Middleton looks very elegant in Princess Diana\u0027s favourite atelier Catherine Walker            Pastel Stella McCartney for Oprah Winfrey, with a Philip Treacy turkey and pheasant feather hat            Countess of Wessex wears ice-blue satin by London couturier Suzannah and hat by Jane Taylor            Meghan\u0027s Suits co-star Gina Torres in a very elegant floral tea dress by Costarellos            Fergie was a picture of elegance on Saturday as she paired a navy skirt suit with a Jess Collet hat and towering heelsThe MISSES            Sofia Wellesley, James Blunt\u0027s wife, is in new season Valentino.

He\u0027s got a wonderfully dry sense of humour. Prince Harry was charming about Meghan, they are so clearly in love. We all had a tear in our eye.\u0027 Later he whisked his bride away in an open-top Jaguar to head for a star-studded, champagne-fuelled, black-tie reception for the bride and groom at the opulent Frogmore House in Windsor Great Park on Saturday night.The newlyweds were cheered wildly as they took to the floor with the funky soul classic Land of a Thousand Dances for their first dance at the spectacular royal wedding reception.Comedian James Corden is reported to have launched a dance routine with Harry, his brother William and his father Charles, apparently refereeing a \u0027dance-off\u0027, while George Clooney danced with both Meghan and Kate. After a very modern take on the traditional royal wedding, the late-night revelry followed suit – and those fortunate enough to bag a place on the ultra-exclusive guest list were treated to a night of risque speeches, wild dancing and plenty of stodge to soak up the alcohol.

Tomorrow she will attend her first official engagement as a royal, at a Buckingham Palace garden party to mark Charles\u0027s 70th birthday.Meghan has, sources say, already become a strong influence on the direction of Harry\u0027s public work, particularly his championing of women\u0027s issues.The couple plan to become \u0027Commonwealth champions\u0027, to the delight of the Queen. A trip to Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga in October is being discussed at the highest level and aides are promising that the second half of this year will be \u0027incredibly busy\u0027 for the pair.They will also take a couple of short trips before the summer, including a visit to Dublin. Harry, 33, is yet to visit Ireland but Meghan, 36, spent time there as an ambassador for the One Young World summit in 2014.But it is the visit to Australia, where Harry\u0027s Invictus Games for injured servicemen and women is being held in Sydney, that is expected to showcase the duke and duchess as a new royal \u0027power couple\u0027 Yesterday, a senior aide said everyone, not least the bride and groom, had been deeply moved by how well Saturday\u0027s wedding went. \u0027I think that although the day was unquestionably royal in every way  it felt like just the two of them were there,\u0027 said another. \u0027When they looked into each other\u0027s eyes it was clear nothing else mattered.\u0027 Saturday evening\u0027s riotous party was described as the \u0027perfect end to a perfect day\u0027. Meghan gave a speech in which she grinned broadly as she referred to Harry as \u0027my husband\u0027. \u0027I think he was even more emotional than her,\u0027 a source said.\u0027Meghan also expressed her gratitude to her mother and to her friends  but the person she really singled out was the Prince of Wales. She has been so touched by how welcoming he has been to her and her mother.\u0027 The couple spent their first night of married life in Windsor Castle\u0027s Lancaster Tower, before enjoying a night at a mystery location. But they will return to work this week, having postponed their honeymoon.          Meghan and Harry\u0027s photographer himself has the title His Serene Highness Prince Alexi Lubomirski (right).He is descended from an influential Polish family who received the hereditary title of prince of the Holy Roman Empire from Emperor Ferdinand III in the 17th century.Mario Testino\u0027s protege Mr Lubomirski, who was born in England but now lives in New York, was given his first camera aged 11 by his stepfather. He has also become a firm favorite with celebrities, and has shot cover stars such as Julianne Moore, Angelina Jolie, Demi Moore, Beyoncé, Charlize Theron, Gwyneth Paltrow, Natalie Portman and Jennifer Lopez.Other celebrities he has photographed include Selma Hayek, Katy Perry, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jennifer Aniston, Julia Roberts, Nicole Kidman and Scarlett Johansson. The star photographer is a prince of the Polish House of Lubomirski, whose royal lineage stretches back 500 years on his father\u0027s side and gives him the title: \u0027His Serene Highness\u0027.

You couldn’t have scripted a more perfect day, though of course, that’s probably exactly what you didWhat’s the point in being a professional actress if you can’t turn in an Oscar-winning performance for the biggest role of your life?I loved it all.Well, apart from David Beckham chewing gum in the chapel, obviously. Such grotesque and disrespectful impertinence in front of the Queen would have cost him his head during previous monarchies, and I’m not entirely sure it shouldn’t now.It would be impossible to see all the ecstatic headlines about Saturday\u0027s wedding and not get slightly carried away with one’s own sense of self-worthEven your dimwit cannabis farmer nephew Tyler being caught with a knife at a London nightclub in the early hours of Sunday morning couldn’t force your beaming grin off today’s front pages.But there was one banner headline that screamed a rather different message, and one that will have sent a shudder through many a Palace courtier’s spine.‘MEGHAN MARKLE TO FIGHT FOR FEMINISM,’ said the Daily Telegraph, Britain’s most loyal royal paper.Oh-oh.I read on:‘The newly-wed Duchess of Sussex has been given the blessing of the Palace to use her position to fight for feminism as she plans for her life as the newest member of the Royal family.’The official Royal Family website appears to confirm this, highlighting your belief that you are ‘proud to be a woman and feminist.’It adds: ‘From a young age, The Duchess had a keen awareness of social issues. Aged 11, she successfully campaigned for a company to alter their television advert that had used sexist language to sell washing-up liquid. These early experiences helped to shape her lifelong commitment to causes such as social justice and women’s empowerment.’          The official Royal Family website now highlights your belief that you are ‘proud to be a woman and feminist’ in your bioHarry and Meghan look deeply in love as they reveal their...Is this the best photo from the royal wedding? Twitter...Behind the scenes at Meghan and Harry\u0027s \u0027magical wedding\u0027:...Share this articleI remember discussing that very subject with you when we met for a drink in my local Kensington pub during the week you first met Harry.You told me how you wrote to Hillary Clinton demanding she take action and how thrilled you were when the offending advertising agency, Procter and Gamble, changed the commercial’s tagline which said ‘Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans’ to now say ‘people’ not ‘women’.‘I’ve always wanted to make a difference,’ you said, as you sipped your dirty martini. ‘My parents always told me if I believed something was wrong to try to fix it.’There was no doubting your genuine passion for this mission statement.I saw it in your eyes that night and I read it in your words when we corresponded with one another.A few months earlier, I’d emailed you after a mass shooting killed eight students at the Umpqua Community College in Oregon.‘What is it with your nation and guns?’ I asked. ‘Why does nobody ever want to do anything?’‘Shameful, I know,’ you replied. ‘It’s so deeply controversial and brings up so many other issues race relations, religious intolerances, etc – so since we can’t solve each of those in one fell swoop, the logical solution would be to have stricter gun laws. And there is resistance. Even by the sheriff in that same little Oregon town. I’m not sure how you sleep at night with that over your head unless you fall into Trump’s school of thought that it’s not the guns but the mental illness. So then why give mentally ill people access to buy guns? Legally? It’s just staggering. I wish more people would make a stand about it.’I was impressed by such an articulate and thoughtful response about a cause very close to my heart.Ironically, the day before your wedding, there was another horrific school shooting in Santa Fey that killed ten more students.This prompted the New York Daily News to scream: ‘They do royal weddings. We do schoolkids’ funerals.’I’m sure you would have liked to comment on that massacre, as you used to comment on many such news stories on your now deleted Twitter account.But of course, now you’re a royal, you can’t.Or rather, you can – but all hell would break loose.‘Meghan whacks Trump over guns’ is simply not a headline anyone at the Palace can ALLOW you to create.And therein lies the biggest problem facing you in your new life every sinew in your newly regal body will be shaking with enthusiasm to tell the world how you feel about vitally important issues like gun control.Yet you will very quickly discover, if indeed you haven’t already, that it’s impossible to go political as a member of the Royal Family.          You have been so outspoken in the past, but you will very quickly discover, if indeed you haven’t already, that it’s impossible to go political as a member of the Royal FamilyAnd that brings me back to your intention to ‘fight for feminism.’On the face of it, this seems a perfectly rational objective for an intelligent, independent, successful woman who in many ways personifies the very ideals of feminism.But I can guarantee you three things if you start poking this bear too loudly:1) The Palace machine, still heavily under the influence of the senior royals, will get very twitchy very quickly – just as they did with Princess Diana.2) That twitchy machine will begin to brief the media with anonymous voices expressing ‘concern’ at your activism.3) The British public, fuelled by the negative media coverage, will soon start thinking, ‘Oh stick a cork in it, Meghan, for goodness sake.’This may all seem horribly unfair to you, but in truth, it’s not.The Royal Family has survived this long precisely because it doesn’t do politics.The Queen has reigned for more than 60 years but nobody has a clue what she thinks about anything.  Remember Meghan, the Queen has reigned for more than 60 years but nobody has a clue what she thinks about anything. Same with her mother. And when Prince Charles does weigh in, he\u0027s ridiculedHer late mother, the Queen Mother, was equally taciturn, once famously articulating this perfect recipe for remaining beloved by the people: ‘Never complain, never explain and rarely be heard speaking in public.’Now, it’s true that Prince Charles regularly fires off angry letters to politicians about issues, but it’s also true that he gets roundly ridiculed for it.And while William and Harry have talked a lot about mental health in recent years, they’ve always been very careful to be non-political in their campaigning.They chose mental health because it affects everyone and is therefore not an issue determined by wealth or privilege.The Princes can’t be called ‘hypocrites’ for saying we should all take mental health more seriously.Your chosen causes of feminism and equality are very different matters.Let’s be honest: there’s nothing remotely feminist or equal about being a Duchess and living in a gigantic Palace.You can’t preach about everyone getting a fair shake when you yourself are getting the most prestigious, privileged and unequal shake imaginable, simply for getting married, to a man.Suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst didn’t fight for your right to wear a tiara to state dinners or have your liveried servants heat your cashmere water bottle at night.So tread carefully, Meghan.          Tread carefully. You\u0027re now riding a tremendous wave of excitement and optimism because you looked fabulous , didn’t put a foot wrong, and married a very popular Prince, but that well of goodwill can dry up fastAt the moment, you’re riding a tremendous wave of excitement and optimism.But that’s because you looked fabulous on your wedding day, didn’t put a foot wrong, and married a very popular Prince.If you now start lecturing us all on equality, while your servants fluff your gold monogrammed pillows and your chauffeur warms up the fleet of vintage Rolls Royces, that well of goodwill may dry up faster than David Beckham’s gum wherever he stuck it in the chapel.And I can assure you that Season 2 of your new life will be a hundred times harder as a result.Don’t be too disheartened though.There is no better feminist role model for you than the Queen who has spent a lifetime keeping her opinions to herself yet is the most respected woman alive.Proof that when it comes to royals and politics, less is more.Kind regards, Piers."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/18/4C726F3F00000578-5753943-Unlike_other_newlyweds_Harry_and_Meghan_will_not_be_jetting_off_-a-2_1526922764522.jpg","title":"Harry Meghan return Kensington Palace just two days royal wedding","story":"Keep it chic like Meghan in shades by Ray-BanGet them at NET-A-PORTERMeghan Markle is bringing her own very brand of style to the Royal Family, and we can\u0026#39t wait to see what she\u0026#39ll wear in her first few weeks as the new Duchess of Sussex.

The actress turned him downBut the sexy actress, horrified by the notion of sleeping with a \u0027puerile warmonger\u0027 after the fated Bay of Pigs invasion, turned down the request.Madame Claude did not disappoint her clients and went beyond his wildest sex dreams. She had the perfect girl.\u0027JFK\u0027s blind date was a very Jackie-like sylph who was employed as a fitting model for Givenchy himself,\u0027 - Givenchy being Jackie\u0027s favorite couturier - the book states. Madame Claude had this 23-year old Sorbonne grad wear the exact same white Givenchy dress that Jackie was going to be wearing at the ball at Versailles that very night.She was \u0027Jackie le deuxième\u0027 – Jackie the second. \u0027She looked like Cinderella on her way to the ball. But the only ball she would be attending was the imminent one in her simple bedroom,\u0027 Stadiem writes. JFK was alone with this \u0027swan\u0027 for one half hour before having to return to his hotel to prepare for the evening\u0027s festivities, the highlight of the trip.          William Stadiem\u0027s Madame Claude reveals details of the brothel-keeper\u0027s secret world The madame later learned that the president wanted her to replicate his wife in an \u0027erotic dimension\u0027 because the couple hadn\u0027t been sleeping together.  JFK had even complained to the model that his wife was more interested in fashion than sex.So the swan gave him a striptease and illustrated for him that the two were not mutually exclusive. At Versailles that night, JFK profusely complimented his wife and told everyone in his entourage how fabulous she looked – all the while thinking of his swan.In 1961, the madame\u0027s rates for an hour with a Claudette would have cost a Frenchman $50. However, the cost of this perfectly executed and discreet Madame Claude experience was going be ten times the going rate for the president.\u0027This was an affair of state...and her price for her services to the American president was two thousand dollars,\u0027 the book states. Although the French claimed they had no interest in affairs of domestic or foreign leaders, they did indeed know where JFK was every minute he was in France.The state apartments at Quai d\u0027Orsay – where the Kennedys were staying – \u0027had a thousand ears and eyes. \u0027And there was no such thing as too much secret information\u0027.Impressed by her discreet handling of this encounter, Madame Claude was soon enlisted by the Elysée Palace and the French equivalent of the CIA and French FBI, to provide them with pillow talk and what went on between the sheets.          The president\u0027s press secretary Pierre Salinger (left)  was the enabler who arranged the liaison with Madame after getting her phone number from Frank Sinatra\u0027s valet Rarely appearing in public, she became the most famous unseen woman in France, Madame de la République.Her principal protector was top cop and all-powerful Paris police chief, Maurice Papon, a well-known Nazi collaborator.In fact, French president George Pompidou also protected Claude and used her for espionage.Dr. Max Jacobson was the president\u0027s cover on that trip and Pierre Salinger, Kennedy\u0027s press secretary and future California senator, was the enabler who arranged the liaison with Madame after getting her phone number from Frank Sinatra\u0027s valet.To be discreet, he used code language as if he was buying a gift saddle for Jackie\u0027s horse from Hermes.JFK later requested a second visit by Jackie le deuxième in Washington. But when she wasn\u0027t available for the rendezvous, the ever-creative Claude found an acceptable substitute.Salinger set up all future assignations for Kennedy while Jackie went on culture and shopping trips in the French capital.JFK had no aversion to prostitution or even sharing a mistress with his father, according to the author.He had lost his virginity to a streetwalker in Harlem while studying at Choate prep school. When he attended Harvard, his father, Joseph P. decided that Jack should have a grand tour of some of the legendary legal brothels in France. First stop was one run by Madame Billy, not of the same class as Madame Claude, but an old fashioned brothel with 20 pretty women and ten bedrooms.The father and son duo frequently re-visited the French whorehouses while traveling to the family\u0027s rented summer villa on the Côte d\u0027Azur, \u0027even after Jack had married Jackie and was elected to the Senate\u0027.  Among Madame Claude\u0027s most famous and high-profile clients are: Libyan Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, fashion designer Oleg Cassini, and actor Rex Harrison          Nelson Rockefeller was a client who reportedly loved to pinch the girls and was scolded by Claude for pinching so hard they were black-and-blue for a weekBut nothing topped Madame Claude\u0027s elite secret service.After that infamous night in Paris, the president had raved about his swan and the Camelot inner circle followed.Fashion designer Oleg Cassini asked to meet the same girl on his next trip to Paris but she wasn\u0027t his fantasy sex goddess.Elizabeth Taylor\u0027s fifth husband Richard Burton even became Madame Claude\u0027s favorite Hollywood star client. She adored British actors and he frequently sought out her services when he was having epic fights with Taylor and throughout his marriage.Actor Yul Brynner, Rex Harrison, and Marlon Brando were among her frequent clients. Harrison once requested two tall Scandinavians at one time, and Brando always preferred exotic Oceana types or Tahitian beauties which Madame Claude had trouble finding. So she sent her smartest girls who studied at the Sorbonne and instead of having sex with them, the actor lectured them until sunrise about global atrocities, human rights and other causes he championed.No one had more women than French director Roger Vadim, Jane Fonda\u0027s first husband.Three was never a crowd to the director who liked setting up scenes and giving orders. He introduced Fonda to the infamous threesomes she later complained she was forced into – all with girls ordered from Madame Claude.  Madame Claude, real name Fernande Grudet, was a one-woman and one-time show and very little was known about her during her \u0027reign.\u0027           The French madam fled Paris in 1977 to escape criminal charges after not paying taxes for years on undeclared income. Above she is pictured during her trial in 1986 When it came to clients Aristotle Onassis and Maria Callas, their sexual requests were \u0027too depraved\u0027 to recount, the madame confessed to Stadiem.  Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis, Jr. frequented Madame Claude, but it was during her stint in the US.She had fled France in 1977 to escape criminal charges after not paying taxes for years on undeclared income and she set up shop in Beverly Hills. Old and new clients continued calling.Sammy, according to the book, was a fan of her German swans. The comedian and Baron Elie de Rothschild were two of her top clients as was auto tycoon Gianni Agnelli who gifted her with a Fiat.Agnelli, a style maven, would dress his swans in sailor suits for the sexual encounters on his yacht.Sinatra was a devoted fan of her services until his new wife, Barbara, a tall, blonde, ex-showgirl herself, put the brakes on his frequent visits. Sinatra had snatched her from her ex-husband Zeppo Marx, his neighbor in Palm Springs.Brother Groucho Marx was on Claude\u0027s list and was often dragged to Paris by his longtime companion Erin Fleming who hired Claude\u0027s swans to attend to his never-lagging libido.\u0027Fleming\u0027s hope was that Groucho\u0027s sexual appetite would get the better of his coronary elasticity and accelerate her inheritance of his estate,\u0027 she is quoted in the book. It finally did when the great comic died in 1977 but his sons took the case to court declaring her a \u0027conniving gold digger\u0027 and she was forced to return some of the inheritance. Heads of state and even royals enlisted in Madame Claude\u0027s services.  Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the shah of Iran, was the most generous and lavished precious jewels from Harry Winston on the many women she sent to his palace in Tehran.On one occasion, Claude sent a model who had become a radical Communist and shared her conversion with the shah.But he packed her off back to Paris without the jewels telling Claude: \u0027I cannot make love to a Communist.\u0027Mu\u0027ammar Gaddafi was supplied with a swan at the Ritz Hotel in Paris where she anticipated being fêted with champagne and caviar. Instead, he offered bottled water, dates, and a cassette with Arabic music.But Gaddafi did  eventually gift her with a diamond that she had put on her belly while she belly-danced for him all night. Plus-size model is left standing in her UNDERWEAR on Cannes...The Only Way Is Sussex!

Paul Getty made the girls use a pay telephone at his stately English home at Sutton Place to avoid having to pick up any long-distance charges.Nelson Rockefeller loved to pinch the girls and was scolded by Claude for pinching so hard they were black-and-blue for a week.But Alfred Bloomingdale, department store heir and creator of the Diners Club credit card as well as being the most notorious of the Reagan swingers, got his call girls from Hollywood Madame Alex. He was into sadomasochism.\u0027I wouldn\u0027t let Nelson Rockefeller pinch my girls why would I let Alfred Bloomingdale beat them? Claude told the author. Claude\u0027s girls were givers but never takers.   In Los Angeles, Claude was introduced to Joan Collins, pre her Dynasty TV show resurrection and her friend, Evie Bricusse, horror film actress.Seeing the Bulgari and Buccellati jewels the two women were consciously flaunting at lunch, Claude suggested they might be interested in earning a little extra money.Claude did have clients that enjoyed sampling a \u0027more seasoned\u0027 woman and even a faded star was attractive to some men.Joan asked if the offer included Evie, to which Claude responded: \u0027Absolutely not.\u0027 \u0027Claude was a dealer and these famous rich men were collectors\u0027, the author writes after extensive interviews with Claude to write her memoirs that never happened.\u0027The girl that Claude was selling was basically a luxury collectible, like a Warhol painting, a Cartier gem, a Gulfstream jet or a Beverly Hills mansion\u0027.\u0027Claude\u0027s blood, sweat, and tears were in creating the girls though the ones I met were found and not made\u0027.\u0027She was doing for bedrooms what Hollywood agents did for the screen, discovering and brokering talent\u0027.She was a one-woman and one-time show and very little was known about her. She was the most discreet of criminals and there was no paper trail.\u0027For the first half of her career, she was effectively an arm of the state, a very secret service,\u0027 the book states. \u0027She was the stuff of gossip, great gossip, great stuff, but never the stuff of tabloids.\u0027 With no close friends, no diaries, no letters, she kept a low profile.Madame Claude was born Fernande Grudet, a poor Jewish girl in Angers in western France. She had been a resistance fighter, concentration camp survivor, gun moll of the Corsican Mafia and streetwalker before brokering beauty to power.After leaving LA, she escaped to her cattle ranch in the South Pacific but was caught by Socialist Francois Mitterrand, arrested and sent to prison.She died in Nice on the French Riveria in 2015 at age 92. Madame Claude: Her Secret World of Pleasure, Privilege, and Power is available on Amazon.com "},{"url":null,"title":"LGBT Pride Month 2018 Dates celebrations Stonewall Riots","story":"Donald Glover fans take over pro-Trump forum on RedditGame of Thrones writer reveals Jon Snow\u0027s direwolf was cut from a season 7 sceneWill Smith and Nicky Jam to perform FIFA World Cup official anthemIvor Novello Awards 2018: All you need to knowGrey\u0027s Anatomy Season 15: All you need to knowShipwrecked reality TV show to be revived on E4New on HBO Now: June 2018 TV shows and movies revealedWho is Stacey Abrams?

But friends said they were hit by tragedy as meth users exploited her generosity and took over her house          The actress, best known for her role as Lois Lane in the 1978 version of Superman alongside Christopher Reeve, was 69 when she died in her sleep last weekend in her Livingston, Montana home          Margot Kidder\u0027s final days had been beset with health problems brought on by her drinking, close friends of the actress reveal \u0027She became a target for Livingston\u0027s meth scene,\u0027 added Willcox, who had been friends with Kidder for some 30 years. \u0027They took her jewelry, her silver, anything they could get their hands on.\u0027There\u0027s a famous picture of her with Jesse Jackson with their arms raised, that she had in a silver frame. I just hope that is safe — but I don\u0027t know.\u0027She hadn\u0027t realized what was going on. She couldn\u0027t understand why all these strange cars were turning up at her home at odd hours of the day and night.\u0027Thrice-married Kidder, who found fame alongside Christopher Reeve in the 1978 version of Superman, died in her sleep last weekend at her four-bedroom home in Livingston. She was 69.Bruce Becker, attorney for Park County which covers Livingston, told DailyMail.com that authorities are awaiting a toxicology report before determining the cause of death. \u0027It should be ready in two to three weeks,\u0027 he said.          Louisa Willcox (pictured) who was friends with Kidder for more than 30 years, revealed the actress\u0027s home had been taken over by drug addicts Another close friend, author and environmentalist Doug Peacock confirmed that Kidder had been victimized by \u0027a lot of losers\u0027 but said her heavy drinking also contributed to her downfall. Her favorite tipple was cheap rosé wine.\u0027She was never a dull or boorish drunk, just a little crazy and that is how she medicated,\u0027 Peacock told DailyMail.com in an exclusive interview.\u0027Her habits were getting the better of her. She would go on benders and drink too much. From what I heard she was recovering from one of those and went to sleep and never woke up again.\u0027I hauled her into rehab any number of times, most recently a couple of years ago,\u0027 he added. \u0027But she never really stopped drinking.\u0027I wanted her to hang on a bit longer but that stuff catches up with you,\u0027 said. Peacock.Her friends say Kidder was in great pain as a result of a 1990 car accident that left her in a wheelchair for a while and a degenerative back condition.\u0027Her bones were falling apart,\u0027 said Willcox, who said her friend had become really sick after she joined protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota.Kidder collected a huge library of books for a school for children of the protesters who had traveled from all over the country. She took a U-Haul truck full of books to North Dakota but was unprepared for the bitter cold, said Willcox. All she had was a tent, sleeping bag and Jake, her 150 lb. Great Pyrenees.          This was Kidder\u0027s four-bedroom home in Livingston, Montana. Friends say the basement was being used as a meth lab by local drug addicts - who the actress had tried to help          A Park County coroner\u0027s sticker was seen on the side door of her home last Thursday in the wake of her death. Toxicology tests are still being conducted to determine exactly how she died          The meth-heads allegedly stole her jewelry, silver, and even Kidder\u0027s medication \u0027She didn\u0027t want to die there. It was just so cold,\u0027 said Willcox who also spent time at the protests in the winter of 2016-17.Willcox said she and her husband David Mattson left Livingston for six weeks this winter. When she returned she found Kidder had lost some 40 lb. \u0027She was the ever-shrinking woman,\u0027 she said.But she was still dedicated to the numerous progressive causes that she had devoted her life to, working for days on end with no rest, due to her bipolar condition.\u0027I called it Margieland,\u0027 said Willcox. \u0027Her life was chaos. It\u0027s all terribly tragic.Peacock, a Vietnam Green Beret who spent nearly two decades living among grizzly bears in the Montana wilderness as a way of therapy after the war, said his friend\u0027s death did not come as a shock to him. \u0027She was in poor health,\u0027 he said.The Grizzly Years author became friends with Kidder after the actress suffered a mental breakdown in Los Angeles in 1996.She had flown there from her home in Livingston to get her computer fixed and was discovered ranting in a back garden with her teeth smashed in after an attempted rape.She was taken in by police and that\u0027s when she called. \u0027She was allowed one phone call and she called me. She knew I was the one person in the world that would understand that level of madness, and I was,\u0027 said Peacock.\u0027She was delusional and I understood what she was talking about as I had the same demons that were visiting her. She thought she was being followed by the CIA and her ex-husband.\u0027I just listened to her. We had a calm conversation and I didn\u0027t say get help or go see a shrink and she appreciated that. I had been in similar predicaments myself not knowing what was real and what was not.\u0027Kidder didn\u0027t even know Peacock well at the time. \u0027We were acquaintances and neighbors. I lived in Jeff Bridges\u0027s old ranch house and at the time she lived two or three miles down the road — which around here is considered close.\u0027Peacock arranged for literary agent Bob Datilla to fly to California to get Kidder. \u0027He is much better in police stations than me — I tend to end up behind bars,\u0027 he said.Couple take their 30-year-old millennial son to COURT to try...Former girlfriend of R Kelly files lawsuit against the...NYPD cops who died in wedding-day crash in rented Maserati...Share this article    Kidder was a well-known activist who took part in the protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline at Standing Rock in North Dakota.

That lasted for more than 20 years.\u0027But in recent years as Kidder\u0027s drinking got worse, he saw less of her. \u0027Toward the end she needed people to help her. She had some great people and she had some real losers. But she needed people, because she would fall down.\u0027Peacock was the model for George Washington Hayduke, one of the main protagonists in Edward Abbey\u0027s eco-sabotage novel The Monkey Wrench Gang.

She was often seen riding her bicycle around town. That bike was still parked outside the home four days after her death. A yellow coroner\u0027s tape sealed the door warning people to keep out. A woman at the house told DailyMail.com she wasn\u0027t ready to talk.The family\u0027s only comment was a statement from her son-in-law, Chad Franscoviak. \u0027On Mother\u0027s Day, my wife, Maggie McGuane, was brought by the Park County Coroner and Livingston Police Department into her mother Margot Kidder\u0027s home following her death, Franscoviak said.\u0027The experience has been difficult for her and she is choosing not to make public comment until after the findings of the Park County Coroner\u0027s office have been released. We ask that you respect our family\u0027s privacy during this sad time.\u0027Kidder married three times, but none of them lasted more than 18 months. She originally visited Livingston with first husband Thomas McGuane, who directed her in the movie 92 In The Shade, and fell in love with the area.But her marriage broke up soon after as McGuane was having an affair with her co-star Elizabeth Ashley.She was also married to actor John Heard for six days and French director Philippe de Broca. She famously had affairs with former Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau and directors Steven Spielberg and Brian de Palma. Maggie, 42, was her only child.After her third marriage fell apart in 1984, she said she preferred her dogs to men.Peacock remembered her as someone who loved dogs \u0027more than anyone I knew.\u0027 He said he had helped her bury one of her pets. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/21/4C81806B00000578-0-image-m-6_1526933840770.jpg","title":"Val Kilmer shares photos looking worn day posing fans Comic Con","story":"Batman forever: Val Kilmer appeared at Motor City Comic Con over the weekend in Detroit, and on Saturday posted photos of himself looking tired and worn out          Smiley: He spent the day posing for photos with fans who purchased his custom Funko pop toys, which sell for $80 and come with an autograph for another $80 (above)  Vacation: Kilmer was in New York City earlier in the week, attending a performance of Bruce Springsteen on Broadway (left) and heading out to Peter Brant\u0027s estate (right)          Number one: Fans later noted how polite and friendly Kilmer was on social mediaKilmer was on-hand to sell Funko pop toys made in the likeness of some of his film characters, with the actor charging $80 for the figure and another $80 for an autograph. He teased his appearance on Facebook earlier in the week.\u0027This Saturday \u0026amp Sunday, Detroit Comic Con, is getting closer.

standard for defectors - the women were released into society, but their whereabouts were kept secret by the NIS and they had made no public comments until the television show late Thursday. Seoul\u0027s unification ministry, which handles relations with the North, said the facts needed to be established.\u0027There are some new allegations by the manager and some waitresses about how they came to the South and whether they came here on their free will,\u0027 a spokesman told journalists.\u0027There is need to verify their allegations,\u0027 he said, adding the ministry had been unable to contact the 13 itself and relied on information given it by the NIS.An NIS spokesman said the agency had no immediate comment on the report.Sceptics suspect the defection may have been staged by the government of now-disgraced conservative president Park Geun-hye in an effort to sway voters ahead of parliamentary elections.Park, 66, who was removed from office over a massive corruption scandal last year, was convicted of multiple criminal charges including bribery and abuse of power and sentenced to 24 years in prison at a trial last month.Restaurant manager reveals he tricked North Korean waitresses into defecting -

But the North refused at the last minute to accept a list of South Korean journalists.Sceptics warn that Pyongyang has yet to make any public commitment to give up its arsenal and has a history of going back on its word.In 2008 the regime blew up a cooling tower of its atomic reactor at Yongbyon, the facility that produced the plutonium that allowed North Korea to carry out its first successful nuclear test.That ceremony was also held with much fanfare, complete with international invited journalists, and was heralded as a mark of Pyongyang´s commitment to denuclearisation talks.The following day then President George W. Bush lifted some sanctions. But when talks collapsed the Yongbyon cooling tower was quickly rebuilt and the reactor restarted.In the intervening years, with diplomacy going nowhere, North Korea went on to test five more nuclear devices and develop missiles it said was capable of reaching the United States.To experts, North Korea dismantling nuclear site is like destroying evidence - CNN"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/16/22/4C55CF4700000578-0-image-m-11_1526505518825.jpg","title":"Marks Spencer announces close 100 stores 2022","story":"M\u0026ampS, which rebranded itself as Markle and Sparkle for the royal wedding, has revealed that it will close 100 stores in the next four years in a new terrible blow to Britain\u0027s high streetsWho¿s up and who¿s down on the High Street: Last year 1,700...Stretched by a big rental deposit?

trophies, which are mostly carved, gilded wooden panels that showcase illustrations of weapons and spoils of war, were lucky moved from the rooms prior to the fire which broke out in the Queen\u0027s private chapel before spreading to the main building.  By the time the fire reached the Green Drawing Room, firefighters had just about got  the blaze under control.The first stage of the structural restoration was completed in May 1996, with the Green Drawing Room and most of the other damaged rooms, including the State and Octagon dining rooms, restored to their nineteenth-century appearance, using original designs supplied by George IV. The Queen\u0027s Private Chapel, where the fire originated, was restored in a more modern style.The semi-state rooms are open to members of the public between Spring and Autumn annually, though are closed off during special engagements.            A state affair: The Queen hosts the Irish president Michael D Higgins in April 2014          A

There\u0027s a certain sense in which when you are loved, and you know it, when someone cares for you, and you know it, when you love and you show it - it actually feels right.\u0027There is something right about it. And there\u0027s a reason for it. The reason has to do with the source. We were made by a power of love, and our lives were meant - and are meant - to be lived in that love. That\u0027s why we are here.\u0027Ultimately, the source of love is God himself: the source of all of our lives. There\u0027s an old medieval poem that says: \u0027Where true love is found, God himself is there\u0027.\u0027The New Testament says it this way: \u0027Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God, and those who love are born of God and know God. Those who do not love do not know God.\u0027 Why? \u0027For God is love.\u0027\u0027There\u0027s power in love. There\u0027s power in love to help and heal when nothing else can.\u0027There\u0027s power in love to lift up and liberate when nothing else will.\u0027There\u0027s power in love to show us the way to live.\u0027Set me as a seal on your heart... a seal on your arm, for love is as strong as death.            Harry told his bride that he had missed her after their night apart and clutched her hand throughout the moving service\u0027But love is not only about a young couple. Now the power of love is demonstrated by the fact that we\u0027re all here. Two young people fell in love, and we all showed up.\u0027But it\u0027s not just for and about a young couple, who we rejoice with. It\u0027s more than that.\u0027Jesus of Nazareth on one occasion was asked by a lawyer to sum up the essence of the teachings of Moses, and he went back and he reached back into the Hebrew scriptures, to Deuteronomy and Leviticus, and Jesus said: \u0027You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind and all your strength. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself.\u0027\u0027And then in Matthew\u0027s version, he added, he said: \u0027On these two, love of God and love of neighbour, hang all the law, all the prophets, everything that Moses wrote, everything in the holy prophets, everything in the scriptures, everything that God has been trying to tell the world... love God, love your neighbours, and while you\u0027re at it, love yourself.\u0027\u0027Someone once said that Jesus began the most revolutionary movement in human history.\u0027A movement grounded in the unconditional love of God for the world - and a movement mandating people to live that love, and in so doing to change not only their lives but the very life of the world itself.\u0027I\u0027m talking about power. Real power. Power to change the world.            Meghan and Harry were pronounced man and wife by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby\u0027If you don\u0027t believe me, well, there were some old slaves in America\u0027s Antebellum South who explained the dynamic power of love and why it has the power to transform.\u0027They explained it this way. They sang a spiritual, even in the midst of their captivity. It\u0027s one that says \u0027There is a balm in Gilead...\u0027 a healing balm, something that can make things right.\u0027\u0027There is a balm in Gilead to make the wounded whole, there is a balm in Gilead to heal the sin-sick soul.\u0027\u0027And one of the stanzas actually explains why. They said: \u0027If you cannot preach like Peter, and you cannot pray like Paul, you just tell the love of Jesus, how he died to save us all.\u0027\u0027\u0027Oh, that\u0027s the balm in Gilead! This way of love, it is the way of life. They got it. He died to save us all.\u0027He didn\u0027t die for anything he could get out of it. Jesus did not get an honorary doctorate for dying. He didn\u0027t... he wasn\u0027t getting anything out of it. He gave up his life, he sacrificed his life, for the good of others, for the good of the other, for the wellbeing of the world... for us.            But the tears turned to laughter when the star made him giggle as they exchanged vows in the extraordinarily moving ceremony watched by millions around the world\u0027That\u0027s what love is. Love is not selfish and self-centred. Love can be sacrificial, and in so doing, becomes redemptive. And that way of unselfish, sacrificial, redemptive love changes lives, and it can change this world.\u0027If you don\u0027t believe me, just stop and imagine. Think and imagine a world where love is the way.\u0027\u0027Imagine our homes and families where love is the way. Imagine neighbourhoods and communities where love is the way.\u0027Imagine governments and nations where love is the way. Imagine business and commerce where this love is the way.\u0027Imagine this tired old world where love is the way. When love is the way - unselfish, sacrificial, redemptive.\u0027When love is the way, then no child will go to bed hungry in this world ever again.\u0027When love is the way, we will let justice roll down like a mighty stream and righteousness like an ever-flowing brook.\u0027When love is the way, poverty will become history. When love is the way, the earth will be a sanctuary.\u0027When love is the way, we will lay down our swords and shields, down by the riverside, to study war no more.\u0027When love is the way, there\u0027s plenty good room - plenty good room - for all of God\u0027s children.\u0027Because when love is the way, we actually treat each other, well... like we are actually family.\u0027When love is the way, we know that God is the source of us all, and we are brothers and sisters, children of God.\u0027My brothers and sisters, that\u0027s a new heaven, a new earth, a new world, a new human family.\u0027And let me tell you something, old Solomon was right in the Old Testament: that\u0027s fire.\u0027Pierre Teilhard de Chardin - and with this I will sit down, we gotta get you all married - French Jesuit Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was arguably one of the great minds, great spirits of the 20th century.\u0027Jesuit, Roman Catholic priest, scientist, a scholar, a mystic.\u0027In some of his writings, he said, from his scientific background as well as his theological one, in some of his writings he said - as others have - that the discovery, or invention, or harnessing of fire was one of the great scientific and technological discoveries in all of human history.\u0027Fire to a great extent made human civilisation possible. Fire made it possible to cook food and to provide sanitary ways of eating which reduced the spread of disease in its time.\u0027Fire made it possible to heat warm environments and thereby made human migration around the world a possibility, even into colder climates.\u0027Fire made it possible - there was no Bronze Age without fire, no Iron Age without fire, no Industrial Revolution without fire.\u0027The advances of fire and technology are greatly dependent on the human ability and capacity to take fire and use it for human good.\u0027Anybody get here in a car today? An automobile? Nod your heads if you did - I know there were some carriages. But those of us who came in cars, fire - the controlled, harnessed fire - made that possible.\u0027I know that the Bible says, and I believe it, that Jesus walked on the water. But I have to tell you, I did not walk across the Atlantic Ocean to get here.\u0027Controlled fire in that plane got me here. Fire makes it possible for us to text and tweet and email and Instagram and Facebook and socially be dysfunctional with each other.\u0027Fire makes all of that possible, and de Chardin said fire was one of the greatest discoveries in all of human history.\u0027And he then went on to say that if humanity ever harnesses the energy of fire again, if humanity ever captures the energy of love - it will be the second time in history that we have discovered fire.\u0027Dr King was right: we must discover love - the redemptive power of love. And when we do that, we will make of this old world, a new world.\u0027My brother, my sister, God love you, God bless you, and may God hold us all in those almighty hands of love.\u0027                                                    "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/15/4C726F3F00000578-0-image-m-108_1526913201750.jpg","title":"Meghan Markle makes official engagement","story":"Do it like the Duchess of Sussex in a Goat dressGet it now!Meghan Markle\u0026#39s Givenchy gown took the world\u0026#39s breath away when she stepped out of the car last Saturday, and her Stella McCartney evening dress was just as beautiful.

She also co-founded and served as the senior vice president of the financial services firm, NOW Corp.She also founded a children’s beverage company called Nourish, is CEO of legal consulting firm Sage Works and, under the pseudonym Selena Montgomery, has written many romantic suspense novels and has sold more than 100,000 copies.Stacey Abrams, Minority Leader of the Georgia House of RepresentativesFrom 2007, Abrams became the first woman to lead either party in the Georgia General Assembly and the first African American to lead in the House of Representatives.As Minority Leader, she worked with Republican Governor Nathan Deal’s administration to reform the HOPE Scholarship Program and co-sponsored the legislation that preserved the initiative by decreasing the scholarship paid to Georgia students, as well as funding a low-interest loan program.  Stacey Abrams seen here announcing she has qualified to run for governor in Atlanta in 2018Despite having similar policies, as Vox explained, the difference in the policies of Stacey Abrams and Stacey Evans comes down to their different handling of the HOPE Scholarship Program.‘This dispute has several ins and outs, but the basic shape of things is that Deal proposed swinging cuts to the program that once guaranteed free in-state tuition to any Georgia high school graduate who maintained at least a B average.‘Abrams cut a deal with Deal that reduced the extent of the cuts but still pared back the program substantially. Evans stood strong in opposition,’ Vox reported.Georgia Primary 2018Stacey Abrams is running for Governor of Georgia in the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial election and she will be up against Stacey Evans in the Democratic primary in what has been dubbed ‘the war between the two Staceys.’Both Staceys have similar policies on health care, education and their opposition to President Donald Trump. The Democrat representative for Georgia will be announced on May 22, 2018, in an attempt to damage Republican control over the state.Despite Georgia being far from a swing state, Hillary Clinton was close to winning in the state during the 2016 election, more so than Ohio or Iowa, and this has given the Democratic Party hope of electing a governor there for the first time since Roy Barnes in 1998.This being an important election, it has garnered media attention along with GOP contender Michael Williams breaking news with his idea of touring Georgia with a ‘deportation bus’. But he is unlikely to make it to the runoff election in July 24, with the Republican nomination thought to be won by Casey Cagle or Brian Kemp.Stacey Abrams pollsPolls conducted for FOX 5 Atlanta reveal Stacey Abrams is leading the race for the Democratic nomination for Governor with 58.2 per cent, with Stacey Evans at 19 per cent and 23 per cent left undecided.  Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Evans seen here participating in a debateCasey Cagle is in the lead for the Republican nomination at 30.5 per cent, with Brian Kemp in second place with 19.5 per cent.Stacey Abrams endorsementsHillary Clinton endorsed Stacey Abrams as the Democratic candidate over former state representative Stacey Evans and said: ‘A Yale educated attorney, Abrams is the only candidate with bold new plans to ensure Georgians have access to good jobs, quality public schools, affordable child care and higher education.’Abrams has also been endorsed by Bernie Sanders, who said that she had ‘real solutions that will help the lives of working people in Georgia’. Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris have both also endorsed Stacey Abrams.Donald Glover fans take over pro-Trump forum on RedditGame of Thrones writer reveals Jon Snow\u0027s direwolf was cut from a season 7 sceneWill Smith and Nicky Jam to perform FIFA World Cup official anthemIvor Novello Awards 2018: All you need to knowGrey\u0027s Anatomy Season 15: All you need to knowShipwrecked reality TV show to be revived on E4New on HBO Now: June 2018 TV shows and movies revealedWho is Stacey Abrams?

The Iraqi dictator was toppled in 2003 during the U.S.-led invasion and hanged three years later for crimes against humanityBuilt by a Danish shipyard while Iraq was at war with Iran, the yacht was passed on to Saudi Arabia - then a Saddam ally - to protect it from air strikes on Basra.The kingdom, which fell out with Saddam after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, then handed the vessel over to Jordan. Its subsequent movements were unclear until Iraq tracked it down in the French resort of Nice, where a court seized it and sent it home.While the \u0027Basrah Breeze\u0027 survived the turmoil of Saddam\u0027s decline and demise, its sister ship \u0027al-Mansur\u0027 - which he also never boarded - suffered a different fate.It sank in the Shatt al-Arab waterway that passes through Basra after it was hit by U.S. planes and then stripped bare in the chaotic aftermath of his overthrow.

In 2015, she reportedly told the journalist Piers Morgan that she had not always sought showbusiness success.‘As a kid, I wanted to be either the president or a news broadcaster like you,’ she told him.

His mother, Princess Diana, was said to have considered moving to America.And the claim appears to have caused consternation at Kensington Palace yesterday, with the Duchess giving her official spokesman permission to take the unusual step of issuing a public denial.‘This conversation you describe with an associate is fictitious,’ the spokesman insisted.I am, though, not the only one to hear rumours that Meghan still holds political ambitions.Former Times editor Sir Simon Jenkins says: ‘Her friends and associates affirm that she is a political animal.‘Such is her fame, she could perfectly well follow a route taken by a certain Ronald Reagan. She might lead for the Democrats against a Republican Ivanka Trump. All I can say is, why not?’Meghan’s best friend is Jessica Mulroney, whose father-in-law, Brian, was prime minister of Canada for nine years.Meghan has strong political views and attacked Donald Trump in 2016 for being ‘isive’ and ‘misogynistic’. She might have to reach an accommodation with her new chum George Clooney, who is said to hold political ambitions of his own. Perhaps he could be her running mate."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/01/4C898F2700000578-5759713-Auctioning_under_the_name_ClaireOliver87_the_listing_included_th-a-28_1527035182950.jpg","title":"Official royal wedding gift bag sells 21 400 eBay","story":"    Included in the listing was a bottle of Windsor Castle spring water, a fridge magnet, an over-sized chocolate coin, a tin of shortbread biscuits, a spectator badge, a spectator wristband, a parking sticker, the order of service, a postcard, a map and day briefing, entry card letter and finally the tote bag itself          Auctioning under the name ClaireOliver87, the listing included the entire contents of the gift bag as well as the paperwork received on and prior to the dayThe guests arrived at 9am to see 600 VIPs including the Queen, Prince Philip and Prince Charles as well as the Clooneys, the Beckhams, Elton John and Oprah Winfrey turn up for the A-list wedding of the decade. And as 120,000 well-wishers fought for space outside the castle these privileged 1,200 were able to get great views of the newlyweds as they kissed outside the chapel and paraded past in the royal Ascot Landau carriage. But within hours of the event finishing dozens of their free hessian gift bags were being auctioned off to the highest bidder.Many of the sellers had clearly planned to do it in advance because they photographed the items outside St George\u0027s Chapel to ensure they looked genuine on eBay.           Bids for items have now reached more than £1,000 even though they were handed out for free by Meghan and Harry  Guests invited by Meghan and Harry to see them marry are already cashing in by selling their gift bags on eBay for £400 or more          Guests arriving in the grounds of Windsor Castle passed tables where bags were handed out to each guest but some have taken advantage of this generosity          The canvas bags had the happy couple\u0027s initials on the side and are being sold on the promise buyers will be getting a piece of royal wedding historySo why WERE the Beckhams and Clooneys (not to mention Chloe...Why did George and Charlotte suddenly go missing?

According to the Sunday Times. Wedding guest Peter Fearnhead, co-founder of African Parks, told the Sunday Telegraph: \u0027When Harry and Meghan came in they stood on the podium and Prince William introduced them.\u0027Prince Charles made a really gracious speech, it was amazingly endearing. He\u0027s got a wonderfully dry sense of humour. Prince Harry was charming about Meghan, they are so clearly in love. We all had a tear in our eye.\u0027 Later he whisked his bride away in an open-top Jaguar to head for a star-studded, champagne-fuelled, black-tie reception for the bride and groom at the opulent Frogmore House in Windsor Great Park on Saturday night.The newlyweds were cheered wildly as they took to the floor with the funky soul classic Land of a Thousand Dances for their first dance at the spectacular royal wedding reception.Comedian James Corden is reported to have launched a dance routine with Harry, his brother William and his father Charles, apparently refereeing a \u0027dance-off\u0027, while George Clooney danced with both Meghan and Kate. After a very modern take on the traditional royal wedding, the late-night revelry followed suit – and those fortunate enough to bag a place on the ultra-exclusive guest list were treated to a night of risque speeches, wild dancing and plenty of stodge to soak up the alcohol.

ITV’s coverage peaked at 3.6million.The combined average audience for BBC and ITV was around 11million. But this was lower than the figure for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding in 2011, which had a combined audience of 17.6million – although this included people watching on catch-up. Charles and Diana’s wedding was watched by more than 28million in 1981.Saturday’s FA Cup Final averaged 6.7million viewers and peaked at 8.7million on BBC1. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/22/22/4C89BB6F00000578-0-image-m-23_1527025961832.jpg","title":"Amazon Volvo launch test driving service car delivered you","story":"    Volvos can be test driven after making an order on your phone in June and July after a new service launched between the car brand and AmazonChimes ring out across Manchester to mark exactly one year...Terrifying moment a driver gets out of his truck, smashes a...Share this articleThe signing-up process takes minutes and a delivery time will be confirmed immediately on Amazon’s Prime Now delivery service.

Good one! What he meant was ‘the less we will be regarded as parasitic stooges of inertia’.The public would possibly like to see the upper house reduced to something far smaller than 600.But 600 is the figure mentioned in a recent review by Lord Burns, a former Whitehall civil servant. Sound Establishment man, is Terry Burns. He’ll never suggest anything too upsetting. Most peers are delighted by Burns’s review because it does not recommend forced eviction for any current peer. Graze on, sheep. Lord Young has this week noted, with little more than a pointed stare, that the Lib Dems, who currently have a ridiculous 100 peers, have not yet put anyone up for retirement.          A new poll showed there is now dwindling support for the Upper House as many call for it to be abolished Their leader, Lord Newby, yesterday merely moaned that one of the incoming Tory life peers, Andrew Tyrie, recently accepted the chairmanship of an independent body. Lord Young announced that Tyrie would be sitting as a non-affiliate peer.On Monday, that unhappy figure Lord Adonis (a former Blair aide bent out of shape by Brexit) made a similar petty point about political allegiances. Ditto Lady Hayman yesterday. Party power is how they view everything but it misses the point. The problem with the Lords is both its size and, now, its very existence.Several peers yesterday hear-heared when Lord Burns’s report was mentioned. Of course they did.Burns does not threaten to abolish them and allows for them to remain almost as big as the Commons.Lord Young, a gracious stick, smeared his replies with charm. He all but admitted that Theresa May’s Government is trying to say nothing on Lords reform. He murmured: ‘This is the 15th question on the composition of the house I have answered – or, to be more accurate, the 15th I’ve been asked.’ Droll laughter.All those ex-MPs and ex-charity bosses and ex-quangocrats and ex-soapy bishops just want the place to teeter on for another few years until they’ve croaked.

Banks have been accused of ripping off customers taking unauthorised overdrafts Gareth Shaw, of Which?, said: ‘It’s alarming that the majority of banks are still allowed to charge more than payday loan firms through these rip-off overdraft fees. These extortionate fees can cost thousands of pounds a year, hitting those who can afford it least.’Along with 84 MPs from all major political parties, Which? is demanding City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority take urgent action to restrict these unfair charges.In a bid to reduce fees, the Competition and Markets Authority told firms in May 2016 that they must set a monthly maximum charge for unplanned overdraft usage.However, it stopped short of specifying what the cap should be and limiting how much banks can charge.The FCA has also raised concerns about banks’ high fees for unarranged overdrafts.It is expected to publish the findings of an inquiry into high-cost credit such as overdraft charges on next Thursday. A spokesman for the FCA said: ‘Often the fees are too high and charges can be unreasonable.‘We think the market may need fundamental reform and we have questioned the role of unarranged overdrafts should play in a modern market.’The financial regulator capped payday loan fees at 0.8 per cent a day of the amount borrowed in 2015 – equivalent to £24 on a £100 loan taken out for 30 days.Many major banks and building societies are currently overhauling their planned and unplanned overdraft charges.Lloyds and Halifax have scrapped unauthorised overdraft charges altogether.Santander said it is reducing its fees from July 10 and removing them entirely for four million customers with its 123, Select and Private accounts. Under the changes customers would pay between £30 and £100 to use a £100 unplanned overdraft for 30 days – rather than £179.But experts say many of the changes banks are introducing do not go far enough and that customers are still paying over the odds to borrow small amounts of money.They also argue that because caps are monthly and not per day it means that borrowers are also penalised if they are in the red over two billing periods.Consumer rights expert Martyn James said: ‘People thought the bad old days of bank charges ended years ago – but all firms did was switch from one-off big charges to smaller, more frequent ones, all topped up with interest. These fees are unfair, unclear and are pushing people further into debt.’A spokesman for UK Finance, the trade body that represents the banking industry, said: ‘An unarranged overdraft might arise where customers have miscalculated their finances, although we would always encourage them to contact their bank to arrange an overdraft and minimise costs. Text alerts can help customers take action if they are going overdrawn.’It added that most banks have a fee-free buffer zone of around £10 to £20.Santander said: ‘We continue to focus on supporting customers with managing their money and have specialist support teams in place for those struggling with debt.’A spokesman for TSB said overdrafts can help customers to manage their money but added: ‘A lack of transparency in the market and understanding of how to use them can make them an expensive source of borrowing.’ First Direct, HSBC and NatWest said arranged payday loans and unarranged overdrafts are not comparable and that customers would pay far less for an arranged overdraft. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/01/4C6180D400000578-0-image-a-7_1526604848045.jpg","title":"One five families bribing teenage children school time","story":"    Parents are attempting to get their children to study harder and be punctual by bribing them, Santander\u0027s telling new study showsFor this group arriving at school on time commanded a premium of £10 a week on average, with chores such as cleaning a room priced at £5 a week.Children in London collect an average £26.70 a week in basic pocket money, compared with £18.36 outside the capital, according to the survey.

The actress turned him downBut the sexy actress, horrified by the notion of sleeping with a \u0027puerile warmonger\u0027 after the fated Bay of Pigs invasion, turned down the request.Madame Claude did not disappoint her clients and went beyond his wildest sex dreams. She had the perfect girl.\u0027JFK\u0027s blind date was a very Jackie-like sylph who was employed as a fitting model for Givenchy himself,\u0027 - Givenchy being Jackie\u0027s favorite couturier - the book states. Madame Claude had this 23-year old Sorbonne grad wear the exact same white Givenchy dress that Jackie was going to be wearing at the ball at Versailles that very night.She was \u0027Jackie le deuxième\u0027 – Jackie the second. \u0027She looked like Cinderella on her way to the ball. But the only ball she would be attending was the imminent one in her simple bedroom,\u0027 Stadiem writes. JFK was alone with this \u0027swan\u0027 for one half hour before having to return to his hotel to prepare for the evening\u0027s festivities, the highlight of the trip.          William Stadiem\u0027s Madame Claude reveals details of the brothel-keeper\u0027s secret world The madame later learned that the president wanted her to replicate his wife in an \u0027erotic dimension\u0027 because the couple hadn\u0027t been sleeping together.  JFK had even complained to the model that his wife was more interested in fashion than sex.So the swan gave him a striptease and illustrated for him that the two were not mutually exclusive. At Versailles that night, JFK profusely complimented his wife and told everyone in his entourage how fabulous she looked – all the while thinking of his swan.In 1961, the madame\u0027s rates for an hour with a Claudette would have cost a Frenchman $50. However, the cost of this perfectly executed and discreet Madame Claude experience was going be ten times the going rate for the president.\u0027This was an affair of state...and her price for her services to the American president was two thousand dollars,\u0027 the book states. Although the French claimed they had no interest in affairs of domestic or foreign leaders, they did indeed know where JFK was every minute he was in France.The state apartments at Quai d\u0027Orsay – where the Kennedys were staying – \u0027had a thousand ears and eyes. \u0027And there was no such thing as too much secret information\u0027.Impressed by her discreet handling of this encounter, Madame Claude was soon enlisted by the Elysée Palace and the French equivalent of the CIA and French FBI, to provide them with pillow talk and what went on between the sheets.          The president\u0027s press secretary Pierre Salinger (left)  was the enabler who arranged the liaison with Madame after getting her phone number from Frank Sinatra\u0027s valet Rarely appearing in public, she became the most famous unseen woman in France, Madame de la République.Her principal protector was top cop and all-powerful Paris police chief, Maurice Papon, a well-known Nazi collaborator.In fact, French president George Pompidou also protected Claude and used her for espionage.Dr. Max Jacobson was the president\u0027s cover on that trip and Pierre Salinger, Kennedy\u0027s press secretary and future California senator, was the enabler who arranged the liaison with Madame after getting her phone number from Frank Sinatra\u0027s valet.To be discreet, he used code language as if he was buying a gift saddle for Jackie\u0027s horse from Hermes.JFK later requested a second visit by Jackie le deuxième in Washington. But when she wasn\u0027t available for the rendezvous, the ever-creative Claude found an acceptable substitute.Salinger set up all future assignations for Kennedy while Jackie went on culture and shopping trips in the French capital.JFK had no aversion to prostitution or even sharing a mistress with his father, according to the author.He had lost his virginity to a streetwalker in Harlem while studying at Choate prep school. When he attended Harvard, his father, Joseph P. decided that Jack should have a grand tour of some of the legendary legal brothels in France. First stop was one run by Madame Billy, not of the same class as Madame Claude, but an old fashioned brothel with 20 pretty women and ten bedrooms.The father and son duo frequently re-visited the French whorehouses while traveling to the family\u0027s rented summer villa on the Côte d\u0027Azur, \u0027even after Jack had married Jackie and was elected to the Senate\u0027.  Among Madame Claude\u0027s most famous and high-profile clients are: Libyan Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, fashion designer Oleg Cassini, and actor Rex Harrison          Nelson Rockefeller was a client who reportedly loved to pinch the girls and was scolded by Claude for pinching so hard they were black-and-blue for a weekBut nothing topped Madame Claude\u0027s elite secret service.After that infamous night in Paris, the president had raved about his swan and the Camelot inner circle followed.Fashion designer Oleg Cassini asked to meet the same girl on his next trip to Paris but she wasn\u0027t his fantasy sex goddess.Elizabeth Taylor\u0027s fifth husband Richard Burton even became Madame Claude\u0027s favorite Hollywood star client. She adored British actors and he frequently sought out her services when he was having epic fights with Taylor and throughout his marriage.Actor Yul Brynner, Rex Harrison, and Marlon Brando were among her frequent clients. Harrison once requested two tall Scandinavians at one time, and Brando always preferred exotic Oceana types or Tahitian beauties which Madame Claude had trouble finding. So she sent her smartest girls who studied at the Sorbonne and instead of having sex with them, the actor lectured them until sunrise about global atrocities, human rights and other causes he championed.No one had more women than French director Roger Vadim, Jane Fonda\u0027s first husband.Three was never a crowd to the director who liked setting up scenes and giving orders. He introduced Fonda to the infamous threesomes she later complained she was forced into – all with girls ordered from Madame Claude.  Madame Claude, real name Fernande Grudet, was a one-woman and one-time show and very little was known about her during her \u0027reign.\u0027           The French madam fled Paris in 1977 to escape criminal charges after not paying taxes for years on undeclared income. Above she is pictured during her trial in 1986 When it came to clients Aristotle Onassis and Maria Callas, their sexual requests were \u0027too depraved\u0027 to recount, the madame confessed to Stadiem.  Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis, Jr. frequented Madame Claude, but it was during her stint in the US.She had fled France in 1977 to escape criminal charges after not paying taxes for years on undeclared income and she set up shop in Beverly Hills. Old and new clients continued calling.Sammy, according to the book, was a fan of her German swans. The comedian and Baron Elie de Rothschild were two of her top clients as was auto tycoon Gianni Agnelli who gifted her with a Fiat.Agnelli, a style maven, would dress his swans in sailor suits for the sexual encounters on his yacht.Sinatra was a devoted fan of her services until his new wife, Barbara, a tall, blonde, ex-showgirl herself, put the brakes on his frequent visits. Sinatra had snatched her from her ex-husband Zeppo Marx, his neighbor in Palm Springs.Brother Groucho Marx was on Claude\u0027s list and was often dragged to Paris by his longtime companion Erin Fleming who hired Claude\u0027s swans to attend to his never-lagging libido.\u0027Fleming\u0027s hope was that Groucho\u0027s sexual appetite would get the better of his coronary elasticity and accelerate her inheritance of his estate,\u0027 she is quoted in the book. It finally did when the great comic died in 1977 but his sons took the case to court declaring her a \u0027conniving gold digger\u0027 and she was forced to return some of the inheritance. Heads of state and even royals enlisted in Madame Claude\u0027s services.  Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the shah of Iran, was the most generous and lavished precious jewels from Harry Winston on the many women she sent to his palace in Tehran.On one occasion, Claude sent a model who had become a radical Communist and shared her conversion with the shah.But he packed her off back to Paris without the jewels telling Claude: \u0027I cannot make love to a Communist.\u0027Mu\u0027ammar Gaddafi was supplied with a swan at the Ritz Hotel in Paris where she anticipated being fêted with champagne and caviar. Instead, he offered bottled water, dates, and a cassette with Arabic music.But Gaddafi did  eventually gift her with a diamond that she had put on her belly while she belly-danced for him all night. Plus-size model is left standing in her UNDERWEAR on Cannes...The Only Way Is Sussex!

Paul Getty made the girls use a pay telephone at his stately English home at Sutton Place to avoid having to pick up any long-distance charges.Nelson Rockefeller loved to pinch the girls and was scolded by Claude for pinching so hard they were black-and-blue for a week.But Alfred Bloomingdale, department store heir and creator of the Diners Club credit card as well as being the most notorious of the Reagan swingers, got his call girls from Hollywood Madame Alex. He was into sadomasochism.\u0027I wouldn\u0027t let Nelson Rockefeller pinch my girls why would I let Alfred Bloomingdale beat them? Claude told the author. Claude\u0027s girls were givers but never takers.   In Los Angeles, Claude was introduced to Joan Collins, pre her Dynasty TV show resurrection and her friend, Evie Bricusse, horror film actress.Seeing the Bulgari and Buccellati jewels the two women were consciously flaunting at lunch, Claude suggested they might be interested in earning a little extra money.Claude did have clients that enjoyed sampling a \u0027more seasoned\u0027 woman and even a faded star was attractive to some men.Joan asked if the offer included Evie, to which Claude responded: \u0027Absolutely not.\u0027 \u0027Claude was a dealer and these famous rich men were collectors\u0027, the author writes after extensive interviews with Claude to write her memoirs that never happened.\u0027The girl that Claude was selling was basically a luxury collectible, like a Warhol painting, a Cartier gem, a Gulfstream jet or a Beverly Hills mansion\u0027.\u0027Claude\u0027s blood, sweat, and tears were in creating the girls though the ones I met were found and not made\u0027.\u0027She was doing for bedrooms what Hollywood agents did for the screen, discovering and brokering talent\u0027.She was a one-woman and one-time show and very little was known about her. She was the most discreet of criminals and there was no paper trail.\u0027For the first half of her career, she was effectively an arm of the state, a very secret service,\u0027 the book states. \u0027She was the stuff of gossip, great gossip, great stuff, but never the stuff of tabloids.\u0027 With no close friends, no diaries, no letters, she kept a low profile.Madame Claude was born Fernande Grudet, a poor Jewish girl in Angers in western France. She had been a resistance fighter, concentration camp survivor, gun moll of the Corsican Mafia and streetwalker before brokering beauty to power.After leaving LA, she escaped to her cattle ranch in the South Pacific but was caught by Socialist Francois Mitterrand, arrested and sent to prison.She died in Nice on the French Riveria in 2015 at age 92. Madame Claude: Her Secret World of Pleasure, Privilege, and Power is available on Amazon.com "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/22/13/4C4C447900000578-5754617-image-m-4_1526992340938.jpg","title":"Margot Kidders home targeted meth heads close friends actress reveal","story":"    Remembered: Margot Kidder plunged into campaigning for her environmental causes and for Bernie Sanders in her last years.

I just hope that is safe — but I don\u0027t know.\u0027She hadn\u0027t realized what was going on. She couldn\u0027t understand why all these strange cars were turning up at her home at odd hours of the day and night.\u0027Thrice-married Kidder, who found fame alongside Christopher Reeve in the 1978 version of Superman, died in her sleep last weekend at her four-bedroom home in Livingston. She was 69.Bruce Becker, attorney for Park County which covers Livingston, told DailyMail.com that authorities are awaiting a toxicology report before determining the cause of death. \u0027It should be ready in two to three weeks,\u0027 he said.          Louisa Willcox (pictured) who was friends with Kidder for more than 30 years, revealed the actress\u0027s home had been taken over by drug addicts Another close friend, author and environmentalist Doug Peacock confirmed that Kidder had been victimized by \u0027a lot of losers\u0027 but said her heavy drinking also contributed to her downfall. Her favorite tipple was cheap rosé wine.\u0027She was never a dull or boorish drunk, just a little crazy and that is how she medicated,\u0027 Peacock told DailyMail.com in an exclusive interview.\u0027Her habits were getting the better of her. She would go on benders and drink too much. From what I heard she was recovering from one of those and went to sleep and never woke up again.\u0027I hauled her into rehab any number of times, most recently a couple of years ago,\u0027 he added. \u0027But she never really stopped drinking.\u0027I wanted her to hang on a bit longer but that stuff catches up with you,\u0027 said. Peacock.Her friends say Kidder was in great pain as a result of a 1990 car accident that left her in a wheelchair for a while and a degenerative back condition.\u0027Her bones were falling apart,\u0027 said Willcox, who said her friend had become really sick after she joined protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota.Kidder collected a huge library of books for a school for children of the protesters who had traveled from all over the country. She took a U-Haul truck full of books to North Dakota but was unprepared for the bitter cold, said Willcox. All she had was a tent, sleeping bag and Jake, her 150 lb. Great Pyrenees.          This was Kidder\u0027s four-bedroom home in Livingston, Montana. Friends say the basement was being used as a meth lab by local drug addicts - who the actress had tried to help          A Park County coroner\u0027s sticker was seen on the side door of her home last Thursday in the wake of her death. Toxicology tests are still being conducted to determine exactly how she died          The meth-heads allegedly stole her jewelry, silver, and even Kidder\u0027s medication \u0027She didn\u0027t want to die there. It was just so cold,\u0027 said Willcox who also spent time at the protests in the winter of 2016-17.Willcox said she and her husband David Mattson left Livingston for six weeks this winter. When she returned she found Kidder had lost some 40 lb. \u0027She was the ever-shrinking woman,\u0027 she said.But she was still dedicated to the numerous progressive causes that she had devoted her life to, working for days on end with no rest, due to her bipolar condition.\u0027I called it Margieland,\u0027 said Willcox. \u0027Her life was chaos. It\u0027s all terribly tragic.Peacock, a Vietnam Green Beret who spent nearly two decades living among grizzly bears in the Montana wilderness as a way of therapy after the war, said his friend\u0027s death did not come as a shock to him. \u0027She was in poor health,\u0027 he said.The Grizzly Years author became friends with Kidder after the actress suffered a mental breakdown in Los Angeles in 1996.She had flown there from her home in Livingston to get her computer fixed and was discovered ranting in a back garden with her teeth smashed in after an attempted rape.She was taken in by police and that\u0027s when she called. \u0027She was allowed one phone call and she called me. She knew I was the one person in the world that would understand that level of madness, and I was,\u0027 said Peacock.\u0027She was delusional and I understood what she was talking about as I had the same demons that were visiting her. She thought she was being followed by the CIA and her ex-husband.\u0027I just listened to her. We had a calm conversation and I didn\u0027t say get help or go see a shrink and she appreciated that. I had been in similar predicaments myself not knowing what was real and what was not.\u0027Kidder didn\u0027t even know Peacock well at the time. \u0027We were acquaintances and neighbors. I lived in Jeff Bridges\u0027s old ranch house and at the time she lived two or three miles down the road — which around here is considered close.\u0027Peacock arranged for literary agent Bob Datilla to fly to California to get Kidder. \u0027He is much better in police stations than me — I tend to end up behind bars,\u0027 he said.Couple take their 30-year-old millennial son to COURT to try...Former girlfriend of R Kelly files lawsuit against the...NYPD cops who died in wedding-day crash in rented Maserati...Share this article    Kidder was a well-known activist who took part in the protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline at Standing Rock in North Dakota.

Margot had campaigned for him over the years.          Kidder and neighbor Doug Peacock became close friends after Kidder suffered a mental breakdown in Los Angeles in 1996.

She was often seen riding her bicycle around town. That bike was still parked outside the home four days after her death. A yellow coroner\u0027s tape sealed the door warning people to keep out. A woman at the house told DailyMail.com she wasn\u0027t ready to talk.The family\u0027s only comment was a statement from her son-in-law, Chad Franscoviak. \u0027On Mother\u0027s Day, my wife, Maggie McGuane, was brought by the Park County Coroner and Livingston Police Department into her mother Margot Kidder\u0027s home following her death, Franscoviak said.\u0027The experience has been difficult for her and she is choosing not to make public comment until after the findings of the Park County Coroner\u0027s office have been released. We ask that you respect our family\u0027s privacy during this sad time.\u0027Kidder married three times, but none of them lasted more than 18 months. She originally visited Livingston with first husband Thomas McGuane, who directed her in the movie 92 In The Shade, and fell in love with the area.But her marriage broke up soon after as McGuane was having an affair with her co-star Elizabeth Ashley.She was also married to actor John Heard for six days and French director Philippe de Broca.

But the North refused at the last minute to accept a list of South Korean journalists.Sceptics warn that Pyongyang has yet to make any public commitment to give up its arsenal and has a history of going back on its word.In 2008 the regime blew up a cooling tower of its atomic reactor at Yongbyon, the facility that produced the plutonium that allowed North Korea to carry out its first successful nuclear test.That ceremony was also held with much fanfare, complete with international invited journalists, and was heralded as a mark of Pyongyang´s commitment to denuclearisation talks.The following day then President George W. Bush lifted some sanctions. But when talks collapsed the Yongbyon cooling tower was quickly rebuilt and the reactor restarted.In the intervening years, with diplomacy going nowhere, North Korea went on to test five more nuclear devices and develop missiles it said was capable of reaching the United States.To experts, North Korea dismantling nuclear site is like destroying evidence - CNN"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/22/12/4C86818600000578-5757143-image-a-28_1526988151362.jpg","title":"Pensioner 66 drove car path half marathon says stupid thing do","story":"    Joanna Pine, a 66-year-old retired physiotherapist and counsellor admitted her actions were in some ways a stupid thing to do in the bizarre incident caught on camera in Plymouth, Devon on Sunday    \u0027I felt trapped\u0027: Disabled Ms Pine has described how residents had no choice to exit out onto the pathway of the marathon as they were blocked in Ms Pine, whose blue badge was present during the incident said she was left with no option but to try to inch her car out of a side road, Hawkers Avenue, after waiting more than 10 minutes for a gap in the stream of runners to open up.But as she tried to drive off her vehicle was engulfed by an angry mob of onlookers who swore at her, kicked her car, tried to get into in and even attempted to snatch her keys from the ignition.Astonishing moment motorist brazenly drives her car into the...Crime scene technician is arrested for stealing prescription...Share this articleShe said no one listened to her explanation that she was late for her appointment and needed access to the road and said the entire incident left her upset and in tears.Ms Pine said that in previous years race officials had leafleted residents advising them what to do and a race marshal had even helped her drive out onto the route so as not to interfere with runners.She said there had been no information pre-race this year and there were no traffic marshals when she joined the main road.

That was at 6.05pm.\u0027She said she has learned from the incident but also said there had not been enough information for residents and the event needed \u0027better marshalling\u0027.\u0027I have not interest in the half marathon and so why would I look it up?\u0027 she said.\u0027But if I had a leaflet saying the time it started I would have parked my car somewhere else and not been involved.\u0027For me hindsight and reflection are a good thing and we learn,\u0027 she said. \u0027I was upset.\u0027  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/22/18/4C886F7C00000578-5757343-image-a-22_1527010388022.jpg","title":"Carney Households 900 year worse without Brexit","story":"    Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson (pictured today in Argentina) led the backlash against the Governor, insisting Brexit had not damaged Britain          Mr Johnson launched his attack on Mr Carney\u0027s downbeat analysis during a press conference in Argentina with foreign minister Jorge Faurie (pictured)           Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg (pictured today in Westminster) slammed the latest gloomy intervention from Bank of England governor Mark Carney          Households are £900 a year worse off than they would have been without Brexit, Bank Governor Mark Carney (pictured today at the Treasury committee) claimed todaySpeaking in Argentina today Mr Johnson said: \u0027I believe the Chancellor of the Exchequer has given an authoritative opinion on this matter, which is that it is absolutely not the case that Brexit has damaged the interests of this country. Mr Rees-Mogg told MailOnline said: \u0027The Governor of the Bank of England cannot even get his forward guidance on interest rates right which is his main responsibility so his endless crying wolf over Brexit simply discredits him and sadly the Bank.\u0027The Governor said that the UK\u0027s economy is \u0027up to two per cent lower than it would have been\u0027 without the Brexit vote, adding: \u0027That is a reasonable difference.\u0027Borrowing plunges to lowest level in more than a decade at...Labour MPs\u0027 fury at Corbyn for not expelling Ken Livingstone...Share this articleMr Carney told the MPs: \u0027If you map that into household incomes...

Mr Carney told MPs it was because Britain\u0027s economy was up to 2 per cent smaller than it might have been if the country had not voted to quit the EU in June 2016. Pictured is how the size of the economy has changed since 2004 Asked if the Prime Minister agreed with Mr Carney\u0027s assessment that Britons were worse off after the referendum, a Downing Street spokesman said: \u0027I would point you to the fact that the economy has remained incredibly resilient continuing to grow over the past five years.\u0027Growth has been stronger than many expected after the referendum and in recent weeks we have seen the lowest net borrowing in over a decade, employment up to a new record high, unemployment at this lowest since 1975, real wages growing, 69,000 first-time buyers benefiting from our stamp duty cut and UK exports rising by nearly 10 per cent in the last year to a new record high.\u0027In another Brexit intervention, Mr Carney predicted a surge in invesment once Brexit has taken place.He told the committee: \u0027Actually, with clarity, that ultimately comes, big long-term decisions that are taken about the relationships with Europe, that business will then use those clean balance sheets, access financing, and start to put capital to work, and then we\u0027d see a sharp pick up in business investment.\u0027      "},{"url":null,"title":"Denmark Minister remarks Muslims isnt govt policy","story":"Inger Stoejberg sits in Denmark\u0027s Parliament, in Copenhagen.

Don\u0027t underestimate it. Don\u0027t even over-sentimentalise it. There\u0027s power, power in love.\u0027If you don\u0027t believe me, think about a time when you first fell in love. The whole world seemed to centre around you and your beloved.\u0027Oh there\u0027s power, power in love. Not just in its romantic forms, but any form, any shape of love. There\u0027s a certain sense in which when you are loved, and you know it, when someone cares for you, and you know it, when you love and you show it - it actually feels right.\u0027There is something right about it. And there\u0027s a reason for it. The reason has to do with the source. We were made by a power of love, and our lives were meant - and are meant - to be lived in that love. That\u0027s why we are here.\u0027Ultimately, the source of love is God himself: the source of all of our lives. There\u0027s an old medieval poem that says: \u0027Where true love is found, God himself is there\u0027.\u0027The New Testament says it this way: \u0027Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God, and those who love are born of God and know God. Those who do not love do not know God.\u0027 Why? \u0027For God is love.\u0027\u0027There\u0027s power in love. There\u0027s power in love to help and heal when nothing else can.\u0027There\u0027s power in love to lift up and liberate when nothing else will.\u0027There\u0027s power in love to show us the way to live.\u0027Set me as a seal on your heart... a seal on your arm, for love is as strong as death.            Harry told his bride that he had missed her after their night apart and clutched her hand throughout the moving service\u0027But love is not only about a young couple. Now the power of love is demonstrated by the fact that we\u0027re all here. Two young people fell in love, and we all showed up.\u0027But it\u0027s not just for and about a young couple, who we rejoice with. It\u0027s more than that.\u0027Jesus of Nazareth on one occasion was asked by a lawyer to sum up the essence of the teachings of Moses, and he went back and he reached back into the Hebrew scriptures, to Deuteronomy and Leviticus, and Jesus said: \u0027You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind and all your strength. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself.\u0027\u0027And then in Matthew\u0027s version, he added, he said: \u0027On these two, love of God and love of neighbour, hang all the law, all the prophets, everything that Moses wrote, everything in the holy prophets, everything in the scriptures, everything that God has been trying to tell the world... love God, love your neighbours, and while you\u0027re at it, love yourself.\u0027\u0027Someone once said that Jesus began the most revolutionary movement in human history.\u0027A movement grounded in the unconditional love of God for the world - and a movement mandating people to live that love, and in so doing to change not only their lives but the very life of the world itself.\u0027I\u0027m talking about power. Real power. Power to change the world.            Meghan and Harry were pronounced man and wife by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby\u0027If you don\u0027t believe me, well, there were some old slaves in America\u0027s Antebellum South who explained the dynamic power of love and why it has the power to transform.\u0027They explained it this way. They sang a spiritual, even in the midst of their captivity. It\u0027s one that says \u0027There is a balm in Gilead...\u0027 a healing balm, something that can make things right.\u0027\u0027There is a balm in Gilead to make the wounded whole, there is a balm in Gilead to heal the sin-sick soul.\u0027\u0027And one of the stanzas actually explains why. They said: \u0027If you cannot preach like Peter, and you cannot pray like Paul, you just tell the love of Jesus, how he died to save us all.\u0027\u0027\u0027Oh, that\u0027s the balm in Gilead! This way of love, it is the way of life. They got it. He died to save us all.\u0027He didn\u0027t die for anything he could get out of it. Jesus did not get an honorary doctorate for dying. He didn\u0027t... he wasn\u0027t getting anything out of it. He gave up his life, he sacrificed his life, for the good of others, for the good of the other, for the wellbeing of the world... for us.            But the tears turned to laughter when the star made him giggle as they exchanged vows in the extraordinarily moving ceremony watched by millions around the world\u0027That\u0027s what love is. Love is not selfish and self-centred. Love can be sacrificial, and in so doing, becomes redemptive. And that way of unselfish, sacrificial, redemptive love changes lives, and it can change this world.\u0027If you don\u0027t believe me, just stop and imagine. Think and imagine a world where love is the way.\u0027\u0027Imagine our homes and families where love is the way. Imagine neighbourhoods and communities where love is the way.\u0027Imagine governments and nations where love is the way. Imagine business and commerce where this love is the way.\u0027Imagine this tired old world where love is the way. When love is the way - unselfish, sacrificial, redemptive.\u0027When love is the way, then no child will go to bed hungry in this world ever again.\u0027When love is the way, we will let justice roll down like a mighty stream and righteousness like an ever-flowing brook.\u0027When love is the way, poverty will become history. When love is the way, the earth will be a sanctuary.\u0027When love is the way, we will lay down our swords and shields, down by the riverside, to study war no more.\u0027When love is the way, there\u0027s plenty good room - plenty good room - for all of God\u0027s children.\u0027Because when love is the way, we actually treat each other, well... like we are actually family.\u0027When love is the way, we know that God is the source of us all, and we are brothers and sisters, children of God.\u0027My brothers and sisters, that\u0027s a new heaven, a new earth, a new world, a new human family.\u0027And let me tell you something, old Solomon was right in the Old Testament: that\u0027s fire.\u0027Pierre Teilhard de Chardin - and with this I will sit down, we gotta get you all married - French Jesuit Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was arguably one of the great minds, great spirits of the 20th century.\u0027Jesuit, Roman Catholic priest, scientist, a scholar, a mystic.\u0027In some of his writings, he said, from his scientific background as well as his theological one, in some of his writings he said - as others have - that the discovery, or invention, or harnessing of fire was one of the great scientific and technological discoveries in all of human history.\u0027Fire to a great extent made human civilisation possible. Fire made it possible to cook food and to provide sanitary ways of eating which reduced the spread of disease in its time.\u0027Fire made it possible to heat warm environments and thereby made human migration around the world a possibility, even into colder climates.\u0027Fire made it possible - there was no Bronze Age without fire, no Iron Age without fire, no Industrial Revolution without fire.\u0027The advances of fire and technology are greatly dependent on the human ability and capacity to take fire and use it for human good.\u0027Anybody get here in a car today? An automobile? Nod your heads if you did - I know there were some carriages. But those of us who came in cars, fire - the controlled, harnessed fire - made that possible.\u0027I know that the Bible says, and I believe it, that Jesus walked on the water. But I have to tell you, I did not walk across the Atlantic Ocean to get here.\u0027Controlled fire in that plane got me here. Fire makes it possible for us to text and tweet and email and Instagram and Facebook and socially be dysfunctional with each other.\u0027Fire makes all of that possible, and de Chardin said fire was one of the greatest discoveries in all of human history.\u0027And he then went on to say that if humanity ever harnesses the energy of fire again, if humanity ever captures the energy of love - it will be the second time in history that we have discovered fire.\u0027Dr King was right: we must discover love - the redemptive power of love. And when we do that, we will make of this old world, a new world.\u0027My brother, my sister, God love you, God bless you, and may God hold us all in those almighty hands of love.\u0027                                                    "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/15/4C726F3F00000578-0-image-m-108_1526913201750.jpg","title":"Meghan Markle makes official engagement","story":"Do it like the Duchess of Sussex in a Goat dressGet it now!Meghan Markle\u0026#39s Givenchy gown took the world\u0026#39s breath away when she stepped out of the car last Saturday, and her Stella McCartney evening dress was just as beautiful.

It was important to her to make a point of thanking him publicly, although, of course, he knows privately how she feels.\u0027Another source said: \u0027It is often said that he always wanted a daughter and I think he has been really moved by how well they have got on. There is definitely a special connection there.

He\u0027s got a wonderfully dry sense of humour. Prince Harry was charming about Meghan, they are so clearly in love.

Banks have been accused of ripping off customers taking unauthorised overdrafts Gareth Shaw, of Which?, said: ‘It’s alarming that the majority of banks are still allowed to charge more than payday loan firms through these rip-off overdraft fees. These extortionate fees can cost thousands of pounds a year, hitting those who can afford it least.’Along with 84 MPs from all major political parties, Which? is demanding City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority take urgent action to restrict these unfair charges.In a bid to reduce fees, the Competition and Markets Authority told firms in May 2016 that they must set a monthly maximum charge for unplanned overdraft usage.However, it stopped short of specifying what the cap should be and limiting how much banks can charge.The FCA has also raised concerns about banks’ high fees for unarranged overdrafts.It is expected to publish the findings of an inquiry into high-cost credit such as overdraft charges on next Thursday. A spokesman for the FCA said: ‘Often the fees are too high and charges can be unreasonable.‘We think the market may need fundamental reform and we have questioned the role of unarranged overdrafts should play in a modern market.’The financial regulator capped payday loan fees at 0.8 per cent a day of the amount borrowed in 2015 – equivalent to £24 on a £100 loan taken out for 30 days.Many major banks and building societies are currently overhauling their planned and unplanned overdraft charges.Lloyds and Halifax have scrapped unauthorised overdraft charges altogether.Santander said it is reducing its fees from July 10 and removing them entirely for four million customers with its 123, Select and Private accounts. Under the changes customers would pay between £30 and £100 to use a £100 unplanned overdraft for 30 days – rather than £179.But experts say many of the changes banks are introducing do not go far enough and that customers are still paying over the odds to borrow small amounts of money.They also argue that because caps are monthly and not per day it means that borrowers are also penalised if they are in the red over two billing periods.Consumer rights expert Martyn James said: ‘People thought the bad old days of bank charges ended years ago – but all firms did was switch from one-off big charges to smaller, more frequent ones, all topped up with interest. These fees are unfair, unclear and are pushing people further into debt.’A spokesman for UK Finance, the trade body that represents the banking industry, said: ‘An unarranged overdraft might arise where customers have miscalculated their finances, although we would always encourage them to contact their bank to arrange an overdraft and minimise costs. Text alerts can help customers take action if they are going overdrawn.’It added that most banks have a fee-free buffer zone of around £10 to £20.Santander said: ‘We continue to focus on supporting customers with managing their money and have specialist support teams in place for those struggling with debt.’A spokesman for TSB said overdrafts can help customers to manage their money but added: ‘A lack of transparency in the market and understanding of how to use them can make them an expensive source of borrowing.’ First Direct, HSBC and NatWest said arranged payday loans and unarranged overdrafts are not comparable and that customers would pay far less for an arranged overdraft. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/02/4C84882F00000578-0-image-a-161_1527038146672.jpg","title":"Great Dane Dez jumps owners arms sound rustling paper bag","story":"    Mary-Ann Riley, 46, adopted her 6ft 2in Great Dane, Dez, when he was just 18 months old - but soon realised he wasn\u0027t quite the brave pooch she imagined          He may be 6ft 2in tall when standing on his back legs, but Great Dane Dez is such a scaredy-cat his owners dub him the real-life Scooby Doo          The cartoon character famous for being easily rattled and jumping into his owner\u0027s arms is a more apt comparison than a burly Great DaneWalkies near Mary-Ann\u0027s home in Alfreton, Derbys, proved terrifying for him as he would shy away from moving traffic.Rather than gravitating towards a lamppost for a toilet break like most dogs, he\u0027d give them a wide berth.And rather than finding solace in a Scrappy Doo-sized companion, the neighbours\u0027 four little pugs were too much for him to cope with.After struggling with his fears for two years, Ms Riley decided to take the 11-and-a-half stone hound to behaviour therapy classes.

In Flights, she meditates on travel and human anatomy, moving between stories including the Dutch anatomist who discovered the Achilles tendon when dissecting his own amputated leg, and the tale of Chopin’s heart as his sister transported it from Paris to Warsaw.“It isn’t a traditional narrative,” said chair of judges Lisa Appignanesi, pointing to Tokarczuk’s own description of her writing as “constellation novels” to describe an author who throws her stories into orbit, allowing her readers to form meaningful shapes from them. “We loved the voice of the narrative – it’s one that moves from wit and gleeful mischief to real emotional texture and has the ability to create character very quickly, with interesting digression and speculation.”The book’s themes – “the nomadic life that we now lead in the world, with our constant movement, our constant desire to pick up and go, whether it’s from relationships or whether it’s to other countries”, and “the limitedness, the finiteness, the mortality of the human body, which is always pulled towards the ground” – collide in Tokarczuk’s “extraordinary” stories, said Appignanesi. She also praised the novel’s translation by Croft, an American who translates from Polish, Spanish and Ukrainian and is a founding editor of the Buenos Aires Review.Selecting Flights from a shortlist that also featured the Spanish author Antonio Muñoz Molina, Iraq’s Ahmed Saadawi and France’s Virginie Despentes was “so hard”, said Appignanesi, but Tokarczuk is “a writer of wonderful wit, imagination and literary panache” who has “has written a great many books that sound amazing, but which haven’t been translated yet”.“We really felt this is a prize that has an interventionist quality – it allows writers to be better known in Britain, and in the English language, than they have been previously,” said Appignanesi. Flights, which is published by the tiny independent press Fitzcarraldo Editions, is only the third of Tokarczuk’s 10 books to be published in English. Her 2009 novel Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead is due out in September 2018, while The Books of Jacob, a 900-page historical epic that sold 170,000 copies in hardback in Poland and won her a Nike award – known as “the Polish Booker” – for the second time back in 2014, is due out in 2019.According to Appignanesi, translated fiction is “incredibly important”, particularly today, “when we seem to have this recrudescence of a kind of nationalism that would rather have insularity and homegrown-ness as the way of the world”.Appignanesi was joined on the judging panel by poet and translator Michael Hofmann, the novelists Hari Kunzru and Helen Oyeyemi and journalist Tim Martin.Tokarczuk and Croft were presented with their awards on Tuesday night at a ceremony in London’s Victoria and Albert Museum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/326811849dda01c76bf7115a55ec4431ceacc1ab/0_0_4252_2550/master/4252.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9mYWNlYm9va19kZWZhdWx0LnBuZw\u0026amp;s=f10a9307fd2486848a3ef07931919d70","title":"tesco shuts its online non food website tesco direct","story":"500 jobs at risk as company concludes it cannot make the loss-making arm profitableTesco is shutting down its clothing and homewares website Tesco Direct in a surprise move that puts 500 jobs at risk.Staff were briefed on Tuesday afternoon about the decision to close the loss-making website which was the supermarket giant’s attempt to take on Argos and Amazon by selling everything from sofas to TVs and toys.Tesco admitted it couldn’t see a way to make the website, which launched in 2006, profitable. As a result the retailer said approximately 500 staff were at risk of redundancy.“This decision has been a very difficult one to make, but it is an essential step towards establishing a more sustainable non-food offer and growing our business for the future,” said Charles Wilson who recently took over as boss of Tesco’s UK chain. “We want to offer our customers the ability to buy groceries and non-food products in one place and that’s why we are focusing our investment into one online platform.”Tesco has been running two separate internet businesses in tandem: Tesco for for grocery home deliveries and the Direct catalogue-style website for household goods and clothing, including its own F\u0026ampF brand.Tesco said the website, which will cease trading on 9 July, had struggled with the high cost of fulfilling orders and online marketing. Tesco said the plan would mean the closure of the distribution centre at Fenny Lock, Milton Keynes, which handles Tesco Direct orders.Tesco Direct was one of the many pushes launched during the expansionist reign of Sir Terry Leahy in which the retailer became a jack of all trades, with side projects that included building flats, running a bank as well as selling groceries, clothing and household goods online. Current boss Dave Lewis, who took charge in the wake of the 2014 accounting scandal, has led a radical restructuring of the UK’s biggest retailer. He sold a number of businesses, including its South Korean chain Homeplus for £4bn, and pushed through a programme of large-scale domestic job losses. Last year Lewis did his first major deal with the purchase of the Booker cash and carry chain, led by Wilson, for £3.7bn. The complexity of bashing together the two businesses, which have combined turnover of nearly £60bn, means the loss-making Direct business was a headache neither executive needed.“I think this shows a renewed focus on the machine that is Tesco,” said Steve Dresser, retail analyst at Grocery Insight. “The days of going after markets with no realistic proposition of them adding value are long gone.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c322b2657a41c32447bf525d68dd7aaac34dcfe/0_402_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eaa22a59d6dc3e3538498ccb398256f3","title":"the guardian view on goves clean air plan just hot air","story":"Michael Gove, the environment secretary, made his name during the Brexit campaign for quipping that “the people have had enough of experts” and likening economists who warned against leaving the European Union to Nazi propagandists against Einstein. Mr Gove knows how to attract an audience. Nor has he discarded his insight that the public, if presented with facts that contradict a deeply held belief, will ditch the facts. This\u0026nbspweek Mr Gove was at it again: making headlines without making policy. The cabinet minister produced a clean air strategy which purported to tackle a public health crisis by getting families to open their windows more often because “air pollution inside the home can often be higher than outside”. This is true, but it smacks of the kind simplistic commonsense answer that Mr\u0026nbspGove favours because it avoids the knotty trade-offs called for in any policy, be it Brexit or the environment.The main contributor to the air quality crisis, one that sees thousands of lives ended prematurely, is road transport – a subject about which Mr Gove has strangely little to say. Instead, his plan envisages local authorities finding the cash, presumably by defunding libraries or other essential public goods, to pay for an army of local inspectors to check the dryness of the wood being sold on petrol station forecourts that is used as fuel for stoves. Given his policy’s impotence, it would be absurd to say Mr Gove is taking the issue seriously. As lives are at stake, it is actually offensive.It is also audacious to argue, as the environment secretary did, that “Brexit will allow us to clean up Britain’s air” when his government’s air pollution plan has been rejected by the courts three times because it failed to meet legal limits set by the EU\u0026nbspeight years ago. It becomes outrageous when one knows that Mr Gove’s strategy is a response to an EU air quality law that set legally binding emission reduction targets for five pollutants.The question is whether such a committed Brexiter would develop such a strategy if we were not in the\u0026nbspEU? Mr Gove’s record of pushing for deregulation and repressing teaching on climate change in schools bodes ill. He was found to be acting illegally under EU laws, which can be disappeared from March 2019. Who will hold the government to account following Brexit? Will it be Mr Gove’s environmental watchdog, one so toothless it can only scare ministers into meeting standards by issuing advisory notices? If\u0026nbspthat is the enforcement agency, then every climate sceptic and fossil fuel fan ought to be celebrating in the streets.If ministers are serious about dealing with a public health emergency that is “cutting lives short, damaging children’s health and poisoning our natural environment”, then they will have to change the car culture in this country and support that kind of change in behaviour by going with the grain of what people want to do, which is to be sustainably mobile. The government needs to encourage a virtuous circle of declining car use coupled with increasing use of greener modes of public transport. This needs cash, and crucially must allow local government to charge motorists to use road space. Ministers will have to face down the motor lobby and embrace electric cars, as they have done in Norway. Charging car batteries from central power stations is more efficient than burning fuel in separate engines. If Mr Gove wants to be remembered for more than just PR stunts that ert attention from a trick being pulled, he should adopt a policy that hastens the demise of the internal combustion engine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d115ea7244c6941fe11af1ec67d2c5403c0d93f/2_0_10663_6400/master/10663.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc02d6969e357aeece2b840d797704bd","title":"when the media starts celebrating hipster fascists something has gone very wrong","story":"The Sunday Times profiled members of Generation Identity and made them look like members of a boyband. This dangerous trend of humanising extremists must stopFascism is all the rage these days. Hate is haute, white nationalism is the new black and neo-nazism never looked so good. So the Sunday Times – which recently published a piece about the white nationalist movement Generation Identity (GI) – would have you believe, anyway.You may have heard about GI before. They’re the extremists who physically tried to stop refugee rescue boats from coming to Europe last year. The correct word to describe those who actively seek to oppress suffering people is “monsters”. Actually, “incompetent monsters” may be more appropriate – GI’s vessel got into difficulty off the coast of Libya during one of its anti-migrant missions and an NGO’s rescue ship ended up helping out. Sometimes karma is a boat. The Sunday Times had another way of describing GI, though. Its headline called its members “hipster fascists”. As if that wasn’t vomit-inducing enough, the title of the print version was: “Heil hipsters.”The dubious headline might have been forgivable if the Sunday Times had gone on to unequivocally call a racist a racist and profiled the people GI’s “activism” has had an impact on if they had talked about the families on the rescue boats fleeing unspeakable horrors or the rise in hate crime in the UK.But, no, what it seemed most interested in was GI’s clothes. “Middle-class and well-spoken, dressed in skinny jeans and New Balance trainers rather than bomber jackets and boots, members of Generation Identity are accused of using slick branding and coded language to ‘normalise’ extremist views,” said the much-maligned piece. It crowned the article with a picture of the GI leaders that made them look like members of a boyband.Guess what? It’s not New Balance trainers or skinny jeans that are normalising extremist views, it’s the media. The Sunday Times piece is the latest in a series of problematically chatty articles about fringe figures that have been published in mainstream outlets. It’s only the most recent example of a dangerous trend of the media humanising and legitimising white extremists.Profiles of fascists tend to come in different flavours. Some, like this one, are packaged as quirky trend stories. While they may make a halfhearted nod to the fact that these rightwing groups are, ya know, sort of bad, these stories also trivialise them. They dress neo-nazism up like it’s just a bit of youthful, swashbuckling fun. In 2016, for example, the Evening Standard wrote a piece headlined: “Meet the ‘fascie’ pack.” This came out shortly after Mother Jones had profiled Richard Spencer in an article headlined: “Meet the dapper White Nationalist.” (After much internet outrage Mother Jones removed the “dapper.”) Please just pause for a moment and imagine if outlets like these had run pieces on dapper jihadists or how Isis members look really dashing in black? Yeah, it wouldn’t happen.Not every darling of the “alt-right” is a fascist or racist, of course, but neither are they simply intellectual retrogrades crusading for free speech, as some coverage suggests. The most recent example of this is the New York Times’s story about the “intellectual dark web”, which profiled rightwing favourites such as Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro. This article had the audacity to present Peterson et al not as incredibly problematic reactionaries, who have been given high-profile platforms, but as “iconoclastic thinkers, academic renegades and media personalities … largely locked out of legacy outlets”.It shouldn’t need to be said, but there is nothing trendy about being a racist nothing quirky about being a misogynist and nothing fashionable about being a fascist. Please, please can the media put an end to stories that suggest anything otherwise?A couple of years ago, I got served an online ad for an “egg-freezing party in NYC”. Apparently, there would be free cocktails and presentations from fertility-clinic executives about the benefits of putting your ageing eggs on ice. I didn’t go to the party, but it piqued my interest. At the time, it seemed everyone was extolling the virtues of elective oocyte cryopreservation, as it is called. A lot of my friends in their late-20s and 30s were talking about freezing their eggs or had already done so. And celebrities were also giving it the seal of approval. Indeed, in 2016, the actor Olivia Munn said in a podcast that she thought “every girl should do it”.While the researchers weren’t sure why some women regretted their decision, a possible contributing factor cited was that egg-freezing “was emotionally more complex than people may have assumed initially”. Another possible factor, mentioned in a commentary published alongside the study, was that women overestimated how effective it was.The egg-freezing research came out around the same time it was announced that birthrates in the US have fallen to a 30-year low. Together, the studies paint a depressing picture of the commodification of childbirth in the US. In a country with some of the worst maternity laws and priciest childcare in the world, kids have become luxury items."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a52d1cae0c9d9263afa7a7282ee58f32fe888220/0_148_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81825979f97f03690de1f1a034cd64e7","title":"blame east europe western past","story":"There’s now a growing perception within Europe that one specific category of societies or citizens deserves to be labelled with scorn or condescending regret. That category is geographically defined: it’s in the east. In Brussels, Paris, Berlin, and elsewhere in the western part of the continent, it’s become almost common wisdom to say the “easterners” are spoilers in the EU club. Is that fair?Last week Emmanuel Macron, Europe’s poster boy for liberal democracy, seemed to echo that rather patronising western vision: “The last 15 years have shown a path that has weakened Europe by thinking all the time that it should be enlarged,” he said. The rise of populism in former communist-bloc countries has encouraged the notion that if it weren’t for central and\u0026nbspeastern Europe, things would be running much more\u0026nbspsmoothly in the EU. Perhaps it’s time to debunk a\u0026nbspfew stereotypes.This is not to deny that there are serious problems. Poland’s ultra-conservative, nationalist government has come under EU commission procedures for breaching the rule of law. Viktor Orbán’s brand of “illiberal democracy” in Hungary has caused a lot of trouble.Next year will mark the 30th anniversary of the 1989 revolutions that allowed Europe’s reunification. But it now looks likely that the anniversary will be marred by acrimony and tension. The “east” has attained a kind of pariah status. Central and eastern Europeans, goes the logic, “just don’t get” the European project: they’re in it only for the money, they don’t cooperate with Brussels as they should, they’re troublesome, they’re xenophobic, and they hanker for authoritarianism – what a success the club would be without them!But aren’t we forgetting something? Look at the outcome of Italy’s recent elections: anti-immigration populists and far-right extremists are now slated to form the next government in the eurozone’s third biggest economy. And what about Austria, where the far-right Freedom party holds three key ministries? In Germany, not only does the far-right AfD control 92 seats in the Bundestag (a first for an extremist party since the second world war), its ideology now seems to hold sway on how Bavaria’s ruling CSU party is preparing for elections in the autumn in that powerful regional state. Nor can it be said that France, despite Marine Le Pen’s defeat, has rid itself of xenophobic and anti-Muslim sentiment.To ascribe all Europe’s woes to its eastern part is simplistic and in no small part disingenuous. Not only that, but “reading” Europe along east-west lines risks feeding the very isions that pro-Europeans say they want to solve or repair. Tit-for-tat rhetoric is rife and historical complexes abound, with Germany’s influence being an obvious source of resentment.Setting the record straight on western Europe’s own worrisome traits and mistakes might help rekindle a sense of collective endeavour that seems to be cruelly lacking these days. Let’s remember that back in 2005 it was French and Dutch citizens (voting in referendums) who delivered a massive blow to plans for further European integration by rejecting the proposed new EU constitution – not the newly admitted easterners. Nor is central and eastern Europe a homogeneous bloc. Slovakia is a keen member of the eurozone. And some easterners, in particular in the Baltic states, support common EU defence projects.East-west relations within the EU are now so fraught that it’s become tempting to moan about the consequences of Europe’s reunification rather than to applaud it as a major accomplishment for human dignity and the freedom of nations to choose their own destiny, at the heart of a continent devastated by war and totalitarianism in the 20th century.Populists in eastern Europe feed on genuine contemporary frustrations. (Wages are much lower, so catching up with the west feels like an endless process.) They also play on deep historical grievances: an understandable sense of abandonment after the second world war, and the notion that if western Europe had it so good in the second half of the last century, that was because its poorer, eastern half was left to suffer under dictatorship – in a word, sacrificed.Western Europeans thought the bridging of psychological gaps that derive from differences in historical experiences would be easier. But in the east, overcoming the lingering trauma of having been part of Europe’s “bloodlands”, where the crimes of Nazism and Stalinism converged, remains an unfulfilled task – one that westerners can’t fully grasp, simply because their memory is different.This is not to say a blind eye should be turned to democratic backsliding: the EU must defend its principles if it is to survive. But acknowledging the burden and the pains that our eastern neighbours endured, and paying tribute to the legacy of the people power of 1989, might perhaps go a long way to defusing some of today’s disputes.In Bratislava recently I met the writer Fedor Gál, one of the heroes of the 1989 uprising in Czechoslovakia. When I asked him about east-west tensions in today’s Europe, he said this about his region: “We yet have to understand that Europe is a path, not just a source of income.” If we want to find a way of relating to one another, and not just squabbling over quotas or money, we need to show we are aware of history. Calling out misbehaviour when it occurs is necessary, but not enough. We westerners carry our own share of responsibility for Europe’s travails. We have to acknowledge that for us too, the European project is a path."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1a22179d23ae6a4ac5e3519b750ce7b7be2be97/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7456b66678287de68112e16682111c6 1010w","title":"great british bee count 2018 in pictures","story":"As the fifth annual Great British Bee Count gets under way, wildlife and gardening experts are calling on the public to grow weeds to help Britain’s bees.

The Spanish club would not sell and, what was more, they told the Arsenal chief executive he could not have anybody.Then Gazidis’s stars aligned. Over at the Real training pitches the club’s new manager, Carlo Ancelotti, told Mesut Özil he would not be assured of a starting place. Özil threw his toys and, rather abruptly, Gazidis was told he could take the Germany superstar, which he did.Gazidis is fond of telling the story because it has plenty of zesty ingredients, not least football’s everlasting capacity to surprise. But he tells it, more than anything, because it was a cool thing to have been a part of and, at times like these, even men in his position and with his icy temperament can be touched by a childlike excitement.Gazidis is, first and foremost, a football lover. Born in Johannesburg, he moved to Manchester at the age of four where he supported City and was an outstanding schoolboy player. Having obtained a masters in law, he pursued his career as a lawyer but the bug did not leave him. Gazidis was one of the founder members of Major League Soccer in the United States, and he worked there until 2008.The Özil deal has been one of the high points of Gazidis’s nine and a half years at Arsenal and yet the opportunistic element to it did not seem to fit with his personality. Gazidis is not an off-the-cuff operator. He is a contemplator, a deep thinker, who will calmly consider each decision from every conceivable angle. Perhaps he quickly concluded that Özil was a no-brainer he did not have to over-analyse this one.Gazidis is primed to announce the most significant signing of his career and, as the process to appoint a managerial successor to Arsène Wenger approached its endgame last week, there was the temptation to wonder, once again, whether he was about to act out of character. The 53-year-old is, by nature, risk-averse and not inclined to roll the dice. And yet he looked set to go for Mikel Arteta – a man with zero experience of being a manager.Gazidis sounds like a marketing executive when he describes Arsenal’s determination to do things their way, even if it means going against the grain. “We zig where others zag,” he once said. They were ready to zig and then some.Something changed over the weekend and, rather than Arteta, Gazidis is now putting the finishing touches to the appointment of Unai Emery, the former Paris Saint-Germain and Sevilla manager – an altogether safer bet, despite his often volatile touchline manner. Many will say the Arsenal squad, so indulged by Wenger, need an iron-fist-in-an-iron-glove kind of guy.The club have attempted a piece of revisionism and who can blame them? There was from the outset only one outstanding candidate for the job, they say, and he is about to get it. Why, then, were discussions so advanced with Arteta that the conversation had turned to his backroom staff? On Sunday night he still expected to be offered the post.Maybe it was a fiendish attempt by Gazidis and his inner circle to throw people off the scent, to use Arteta as a smokescreen for Emery, before dashing his hopes at the last. Or maybe not. It is simply not Gazidis’s style.More likely is that, when push came to shove, Gazidis played the percentages. Emery has experience, pedigree. He is an outstanding candidate because of his body of work over 14 seasons in management, particularly at Sevilla, where he won three Europa Leagues in a row.Why is there still the feeling that Gazidis has somehow copped out that he has taken the middle ground? Emery does not have the cachet of Ancelotti, Max Allegri or Luis Enrique while, at the other end of the spectrum, neither does the appointment fire the imagination in the same way that Arteta or Patrick Vieira might have done. Arsenal had an interest in Thomas Tuchel but he chose PSG. Now they have the man supplanted by him in Paris.The broader context to the decision-making process has been shaped by Gazidis’s experience of working alongside, or underneath, everybody’s favourite benevolent dictator, Wenger.Gazidis has long advocated a management structure that does not rest on a single point or employee because, when it fails, there is the potential for the whole thing to collapse. He has wanted a broader coalition of talented specialists greater than the sum of its parts and, for so long, his efforts were frustrated by Wenger, to whom the club’s majority shareholder, Stan Kroenke, was in\u0026nbspthrall.Wenger had a hotline to Kroenke and he could shape or veto Gazidis’s ideas. Gazidis wanted a director of football but Wenger pushed his friend Dick Law into a position of executive-level authority. Gazidis wanted greater expertise in data and contracts and hired Hendrik Almstadt only for Wenger to say he did not want him. Almstadt ended up going to Aston Villa.Gazidis oversaw the purchase of the data analytics company, StatDNA, but Wenger was not a fan. Gazidis wanted to find a role for Arteta after he retired as a player at the club in 2016 but Wenger had warned that “you cannot create artificial\u0026nbsppositions”.A criticism of Gazidis is that he picks his battles so carefully he avoids having them at all that he did not do enough to fight Wenger for so many years and, consequently, the club was allowed to drift. There was the sense he feared that to fall out with Wenger would be to lose his job.But, as the writing came to be writ larger on the wall for Wenger, Gazidis made his move. He said at the end of the 2015-16 season that the on-field under-achievement had to serve as the “catalyst for change” and, since then he has manoeuvred a clutch of new hires into position.Gazidis has overhauled the structures at the club, with the most important appointments being those of Raúl Sanllehí, the director of football in all but name, and Sven Mislintat, the head of recruitment. Huss Fahmy has come in to handle player contracts and Gazidis has finally realised his vision – the creation of a bespoke support system around the manager, whose role is purely to coach the first team. Emery is merely the final piece in the jigsaw, albeit the pivotal one.It was a meticulously orchestrated coup and Gazidis carried it off while showing all the respect in the world to Wenger, who has watched virtually all of his people leave the club. It has felt like a plot-line from Gomorrah, the Neapolitan mafia drama. Gazidis was not always the favourite to outlast Wenger. Now, his position looks stronger than ever.With power comes public profile and Gazidis has never been comfortable with that. He made the decision to step out of the spotlight soon after his appointment at Arsenal, fearing that no good would come from being in the headlines and he very\u0026nbsprarely agrees to media\u0026nbspinterviews.However, when Wenger’s end-of-season departure was announced on 20 April, it was Gazidis who faced the cameras and journalists. By doing so he put himself front and centre of the club’s new era and he has stepped into the line of fire. Gazidis desperately needs Sanllehí and Mislintat to deliver, let alone Emery. Will it work? Will the various cogs click?Gazidis was always going to be judged on The Succession and he has handled part one well enough, even if it was difficult to ease Wenger out and sell it as a mutual decision. The outpouring of love for the Frenchman came to hold sway. Now, part two looms. This is where it gets really interesting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05ab40c576f100568035facd26bbb3b9bddc3077/0_14_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0530a8b4f0a890d68518971c2a6e83bc","title":"brandi chastain plaque bay area hall of fame","story":"Chastain, who won two World Cups with USA, inducted into the Bay Area Hall of Fame – but a tribute to her achievements has … provoked debateThe sculptural humiliation of football’s finest players continues apace.

The plaque in her honor has … provoked debate.Chastain, who won two World Cups with the US, diplomatically said the plaque was “nice” but admitted: “It’s not the most flattering.” The plaque captures Chastain with the pained expression of someone looking at a really bad plaque of Brandi Chastain.Ann Killion, the journalist who wrote the dedication on the plaque, was less diplomatic that Chastain. “Brandi Chastain is one of the most beautiful athletes I’ve ever covered,” Killion wrote on Twitter. “How this became her plaque is a freaking embarrassment.”After reaching a high point 2,500 years ago in ancient Greece, sporting sculpture has suffered of late. The bust of Ronaldo was subject to ridicule, and a statue of Michael Jackson – not known for his support of west London football – caused widespread bemusement when it was unveiled outside Fulham’s Craven Cottage in 2011.It is not just sculptors who have struggled to capture athletes’ likenesses. In 2015, a court artist managed to make famously handsome NFL star Tom Brady look like Gollum during his appearance in a Manhattan court.The Bay Area Hall of Fame is reportedly considering making a new version of Chastain’s plaque.

The award, voted for by supporters around the world, was won last year by the Norway striker Ada Hegerberg, who also plays for Lyon.Australian Kerr has had mixed international recognition of late, after being left out of the Fifpro world XI in March – voted on by fellow footballers – while she was also omitted from the final three in last year’s Fifa world player of the year award.

She was also Australia’s top scorer in their victorious Tournament of Nations campaign, a moment she names as her highlight of her last 12 months.“I came in and I’d been scoring for my club, but I hadn’t really started scoring for my national team,” she told the BBC. “That tournament just assured me that I can do it at any level.

Benítez plans to watch events in Kiev on television at his long-established base on the Wirral. As the teams emerge, he may well reflect on the acute political tensions with, among others, Cristiano Ronaldo which prefaced his sacking at the Bernabéu early in 2016. But he will surely also relive that glorious night in Turkey 13 years ago, when he choreographed the “Miracle of Istanbul”.“I always say Istanbul will be the most emotional Champions League final ever because of the way we came back,” Benítez says, recalling that crazy evening when, at half-time, his side were 3-0 down to Milan, only to haul themselves level before winning on penalties.Yet, if the Merseysiders are hardly underdogs, neither are they clear favourites against Zinedine Zidane’s side. “Liverpool’s intensity can hurt you but Real Madrid have the experience and quality to match them,” says Benítez, who grew up in the Spanish capital. “It’ll be interesting. You’ll see a team with lots of passion and intensity and a lot of pressing and crossing and fast counter-attacking against opponents who can manage this kind of situation.“Jürgen Klopp has three players up front who can all score goals. Mo Salah has done really well but Sadio Mané and Roberto Firmino can also score against any team. We had a good balance and we also had Stevie Gerrard who could make a difference on his own. But this current Liverpool team has three players who can do that. We had one.“Liverpool can do it. They have the quality. But sometimes in these kinds of games you pay for one mistake. It’s how you manage the pressure. Real Madrid have been managing this kind of pressure for a while and Liverpool are in a new situation, so it’s a fine balance.”Win and Klopp’s place in Anfield’s history will be assured. Confirmation that Benítez’s legacy had been cemented came during the post-match party by the Bosphorus when he rescued some invited guests struggling to bypass hotel lobby security. “A friend pointed to me and asked the security guard, ‘Do you know who he is?’”, recalls Newcastle United’s manager, laughing. When the guard shrugged indifferently, the friend declared: “This man is God.”Sheer adrenaline ensured that Benítez, virtually a teetotaller, felt no need of even a single glass of champagne that night. Surrounded by a roomful of people convinced he could walk on the Mersey, the former Real Madrid third-team midfielder partied until 6am – but two years later he saw in another, more sobering, dawn.The 2007 Champions League final in Athens featured Milan exacting revenge, beating Liverpool 2-1. “Afterwards I walked around the hotel corridors until 7am,” remembers Benítez. “They didn’t have enough rooms and my wife was sharing my room with the chief scout’s wife.“Half-time was a disaster because it was so hot. We used ice packets to reduce the players’ temperatures and there was too much sports science. I said, ‘Concentrate! We have to talk about tactics and positions.’”“We switched to three at the back and that changed everything. We scored three goals, we matched them, we had control in extra time and we’d done a lot of work on penalties.”If Jerzy Dudek’s decisive penalty save from Andriy Shevchenko was no fluke, Benítez briefly lost control during the victory parade through Merseyside. “We were on an open-top bus, the music was very loud and it was going really fast under trees with low branches,” he recalls. “We were ducking. I had to tell the driver to slow down.“Istanbul changed my life in England but at first I didn’t realise what it meant. That happened two or three days later. I went to collect my daughters from school and the other kids started singing to me. Istanbul changed everything.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e7d4184da16db822c94e6b752f632cf444e13c3/0_0_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91b0718305133404facfd333c04ed2ce","title":"while the city sleeps london after hours a photo essay","story":"Photographer  Sean Smith captures the city at night, from cabaret stars to road maintenance workers, homeless people to fire wardensPhotographer  Sean Smith captures the city at night, from cabaret stars to road maintenance workers, homeless people to fire wardensIn the changing rooms backstage at Proud Cabaret in London, half a dozen performers are crammed together preparing themselves for the evening’s shows. As one liberally applies eye makeup, another fills the air with a cloud of hairspray. There are nipple tassels, high heels, leather and wigs. It’s 8pm and the night is about to begin.“There’s always a buzzing atmosphere while everyone prepares for the doors to open,” says Fiona Jay-Brown, one half of the acrobatic duo Deux Ailes. “There are a lot of performers so it does get very busy backstage but we all do our best to get the show on the road. There’s rarely a backstage panic. Whether it’s missing tit-tape or hairspray running out, we all help each other out.”Over at the Houses of Parliament, the scene is quiet and the politicians are long gone. Fire officers Eddie Brennan and Paul Chambers sweep through the House of Lords, past the empty benches, along more than three miles of corridors and down into the bowels of the famous structure, patrolling for potential fire hazards.“It’s a world heritage-listed building and I don’t want to go down as the next Guy Fawkes!” quips Brennan.Drawn from the London Fire Brigade, Brennan and his colleagues oversee numerous government buildings in the area. This past year they have investigated more than 200 alarms and reports of fire “but, touch wood, we haven’t had to fully evacuate the palace in the four years I’ve been working here,” he says.Much of the current palace was built following the devastating fire of 1834. The architect, Charles Barry, used brick, stone and iron to try to minimise the risks of another catastrophe but in the interiors he and Augustus Pugin used vast quantities of highly flammable materials.That said, Brennan notes that people present the greatest risk. “You’ve got people laying data cables next to old plumbing and it’s all out of sight, out of mind you find people propping the fire doors open and forgetting to switch off stoves and heaters and lamps. Even after the latest round of modifications, the palace will always be vulnerable to fire.”Further down the river, another London landmark, Tower Bridge, is also staffed at night. The bridge is raised around 850 times a year for registered vessels with a mast or superstructure of nine metres or more.Tower Bridge was the largest and most sophisticated bascule bridge ever built when it was finished in 1894. The lifting mechanism was originally operated using steam to power the enormous pumping engines these days the hydraulics are driven by oil and electricity while the upper walkway – now a function space with a glass floor offering views directly over the Thames – is lit in vivid pink.With the roads relatively free of congestion, Transport for London begins night maintenance work at the Upper Thames Street tunnel. Opened in 1970, approximately 40,000 vehicles and 4,000 cyclists travel through the half-mile long tunnel every day.“We have only one opportunity every three months to close the tunnel and carry out all repairs, maintenance and cleaning for the next three,” says Stewart Wilson, Asset Operations Manager. “You really feel the pressure when you have a dozen jobs that all need to be carried out at once, before the tunnel reopens.”Westminster has become a European hotspot for homelessness, with more and more people moving to the heart of London in search of hope, opportunity and support. By nightfall, not all have managed to get a roof over their heads.The Connection at St Martin’s, next to Trafalgar Square, provides help for approximately 4,500 people a year its night centre accommodates up to 45 people every night – or more during severe weather – on a short-stay basis.“Most of our clients have complex issues so our approach is to help them deal with trauma and help them to gain independence and get their confidence back,” says The Connection’s night centre manager, Paul Symonds.“They’re really relieved to get indoors at night, to have a nutritious hot meal and to get their heads down. It’s like a pool of tranquility while you’re surrounded by the bright lights and madness of central London.”Symonds adds: “You meet the most interesting characters you could ever hope to meet – that’s the joy of the job. I’ve always felt it a privilege really.“We do have our challenging moments with people dealing with addiction and mental health, but generally it’s very fulfilling.”“London can be rough when you’re on the streets. I’ve had some good times, I’ve had some bad times,” says Ken, one of the residents.“You’ve got to understand that to get into The Connection you’ve got to spend at least four nights on the street. They’ve got to see you sleeping out. There are people who’ve been out a lot longer than that, though. At least here you’ve got a bunk and the staff are quite helpful.”While London sleeps, Spitalfields night market comes alive with traders buying and selling goods. Around 750,000 tonnes of produce passes through the market each year and is shifted by 233 forklifts and about 2,000 employees.The market has been on its present 32-acre site near Hackney Wick since 1992 though its royal charter dates back to 1682 when Charles II granted permission for a twice-weekly market for flesh, fowl and roots.Peter Durber began trading at the market in 1983. “It’s still busy and bustling but it’s evolved to be a very different market over the years,” he says. “It was predominantly white trade with Jewish influence but now there’s a very large ethnic influence which has kept it alive and reflects the ersity of London.”Durber works 12 hours, six nights a week, starting at 3am. “Any sane person would look at the hours we work and think we’re all crazy,” he says. “It’s a bit of a beast but I enjoy what I do and when you have a buzz and you enjoy what you do, the time goes very quickly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11cd05a31c1963f4bac7d73ec0e162db49ae7223/85_89_4030_2418/master/4030.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dab67eba96b299c8b75d59f0ac097f4d","title":"women in british film tv writers guild inequality","story":"Writers’ Guild says number of women in film and TV has ‘flatlined’ and urges commissioners to ‘let women tell stories’A report commissioned by the Writers’ Guild of Great Britain (WGGB) gathered data for more than 10 years to identify a continuing bias and systemic gender inequality in the two industries.The guild, which represents professional writers across all genres, hopes the figures will shock TV and film commissioners – especially those who spend public funds – into working harder for equality.Olivia Hetreed, the WGGB president best known for adapting the screenplay for the 2003 film Girl with a Pearl Earring, said: “I have been asked about the dearth of female screenwriters in this country ever since my first feature film put me into that endangered species bracket.“I and others were reassuring: ‘It’s just a matter of time. It’s getting better. It will work itself out.’ But more than a decade later this new research shows that the number of women writing films has flatlined at abjectly low levels.”The Band of Gold screenwriter Kay Mellor said the current dearth of female signature writers for British TV was “criminal”. “Sometimes it takes a collective to say ‘this is not fair’ and it’s not,” she said. “It’s time things changed.”The report points to evidence showing that films and TV shows written by women get a more positive critical and audience reception than those written by men. These female-penned favourites include Victoria (written by Daisy Goodwin), Call the Midwife (Heidi Thomas), and Happy Valley (Sally Wainwright).Gail Renard, the WGGB’s chair, appealed directly to commissioners. “All we’re asking for is a meritocracy for all writers regardless of gender, race, disabilities, or class. Let us into the meetings. Read our pitches. Work with us. We have glorious stories to tell. Let us tell them,” she said.Gender inequality in the UK’s screen industries is not new, but its continued entrenchment will shock many people.. Earlier this year, 76 writers signed an open letter of protest after ITV revealed its 2018 drama programme had one female writer and eight men.The WGGB has launched a campaign demanding action against inequality, Equality Writes, supported by writers including Sandi Toksvig, Jack Thorne and Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/979595f7ad6493e04a942fa08689381320718dae/0_88_1797_1078/master/1797.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f701b5f7e868305a802425d5a9f602a","title":"nines review the haunt brighton","story":"The Haunt, BrightonIt’s a tiny venue for an artist with two Top 5 albums to his name, but Nines’ energy is contagious and his pace never lets upJust about visible through the forest of raised mobile phones – there’s so many in the air that you fear most of them will end up with footage not of a gig, but of other people’s mobile phones at a gig – and the on-stage crowd of guest rappers and friends filming the occasion for posterity, Nines wears a delighted grin. He appears to have missed the memo about rappers maintaining a degree of insouciant, sullen cool, something one of his guests, SL, achieves by the expedient of performing with his coat zipped up to his nose, guaranteeing a certain moody anonymity. The Haunt may be a substantially smaller venue than you might expect an artist who’s had two Top 5 albums in just over a year to be playing – tickets sold out weeks ago – but nevertheless, he looks extremely pleased to be here.To borrow the old gag Keith Richards regularly trots out on stage, perhaps he’s pleased to be anywhere, the politan police having previously proved dauntless in their efforts to stop him performing live. Gigs were cancelled due to “safety concerns”, while YouTube footage shows the rapper both being detained by officers and prevented from entering the Wireless festival to perform a guest spot with Canadian star Tory Lanez, and complaining incredulously that he’s been stopped from even attending a Mist show at the O2. If his current brief tour represents a low-key return to live performance from an artist who’s barely been on a stage in the time his career has crossed over to mainstream success, there’s nothing tentative about the show itself. The audience – young enough that the venue is checking ID and handing out wristbands to ensure no one under age gets served at the bar – are both loudly word-perfect on his oeuvre and creative in their attempts to get a better view of the action. By three songs in, someone has improved their vantage point by hanging onto an air-conditioning unit attached to the ceiling. On the stage, it’s endearingly chaotic: microphones squeal with feedback, the bass overwhelms everything else in the backing tracks, guest stars rush on and off (judging by the audience reaction to his appearance, anyone looking for the next crossover star could do worse than put money on Kennington’s Loski, whose afrobeat-flavoured Forrest Gump takes the roof off), and Nines regularly professes himself stumped as to what he’s supposed to be performing next. But through the bedlam, it’s not hard to work out why Nines has pulled ahead commercially from his road rap peers. His sound hits a sweet spot between hard-won authenticity and a contagious euphoria. You can hear a distinct US influence, not least in the smoothness of his delivery, while Liz and Oh My shift from downbeat, piano-sample melancholy to choruses made to bellow along to. His lyrics are unflinching and unrepentant in their depiction of life on the streets of north west London, but they’re really witty with it: “I went through a burglary phase, blacked out like a goth  probably been through more windows than Microsoft.” The pace never lets up over the course of an hour – all the cameo appearances make it feel like a celebratory, crowd-pleasing UK rap edition of Top of the Pops – and nor does the mood of slightly stunned delight emanating from the man at its centre: “madness, madness, madness” he mutters, as more and more audience members get on each others’ shoulders. Then it suddenly ends, leaving his DJ on the stage to politely thank the departing crowd for coming and buying so many T-shirts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00a1154d3c7c300833047124f9fc04a6c69aea0b/0_0_4000_2605/master/4000.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33bc4f25995477d6e99dc745f5831414","title":"eu trade talks australia new zealand brexit commonwealth","story":"Bloc could end up on better terms with the Commonwealth nations after Brexit than UKThe EU has leapt ahead of the UK in the pursuit of free trade deals with Australia and New Zealand after member states gave the green light for talks to start within weeks.With Theresa May insistent that leaving the EU will involve exiting the customs union and the bloc’s external commercial policy, the announcement from Brussels opens up the possibility that the EU could enjoy better terms with the two Commonwealth nations after Brexit than the UK will.New Zealand’s trade minister, David Parker, said the UK’s withdrawal did not diminish the huge potential gains for his country that would come from breaking down trade barriers with the remaining 27 member states.The international trade secretary, Liam Fox, had recently spoken of “reinvigorating” the Commonwealth partnership with a host of trade deals after Brexit, labelled “empire 2.0” by sceptical Whitehall officials.But the UK will not be able to start its negotiations over future trade with New Zealand and Australia until 30 March 2019. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has vowed to complete the EU’s talks with the two countries by 31 October of that year, when his time in office expires.Brussels is eyeing up export opportunities for motor equipment, machinery, chemicals, processed foods and services. In recent months, the EU has struck deals with Canada, Japan, Singapore, Vietnam and Mexico.Last week May privately proposed to Ireland and to Donald Tusk, the European council president, her government’s concept of a “backstop” to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, which would involve the UK temporarily staying in the customs union beyond the transition period.A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.It would come into force should a satisfactory free trade deal or bespoke technological solution fail to emerge that can solve the border problem. Formal negotiations in Brussels restarted on Tuesday and are scheduled to last until Thursday.However, in a sign that the Brexiters in the cabinet are no closer to accepting the idea of staying in a customs union, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, was insistent on Tuesday morning that it could only be a temporary solution.He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It means what it says on the tin. That temporary means not permanent. It means for a short period of time. “I’m not going to pre-empt the eventual position that we take after we have negotiated with the European Union and with Ireland ... In the same way as when you move house, a bridging loan is meant to be temporary, but whether that’s weeks or months, we don’t know precisely.”The EU has made it clear before its negotiations with Australia and New Zealand that the size of its market offers bountiful opportunities, without the need for the bloc to expose its agricultural sector to cheap imports.The mandate given to the commission for the talks, due to be formally launched in Wellington and Canberra next month, envisages special treatment for agricultural goods in order to protect European producers.In contrast, there are some voices in the Brexiter wing of the Conservative party who would like to radically liberalise the farming sector in the UK, and open it up to challenge from highly efficient antipodean agricultural exporters.Responding after EU foreign ministers announced the talks, Cecilia Malmström, the European commissioner for trade, said: “Together, we will now negotiate win-win trade deals that create new opportunities for our businesses, as well as safeguard high standards in key areas such as sustainable development. “Starting these talks between likeminded partners sends a strong signal at a time where many are taking the easy road of protectionism.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56592e6f502173bf75134c96c84933f5deb4a284/0_75_3062_1837/master/3062.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0142bfa1cb2179fc4571a12851ddefae","title":"john bercow reported to commons watchdog over stupid woman claims","story":"Tory MP calls for video footage of alleged incident involving Speaker to be examinedJohn Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, has been reported to its standards watchdog over allegations that he described the cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom as a “stupid woman”.The Conservative MP James Duddridge, a long-standing critic of Bercow, called for the standards commissioner to secure video and audio footage of the alleged incident in the Commons chamber last week before it was destroyed. Bercow sought to defuse the row on Monday by admitting he muttered the word “stupid” during a disagreement with the leader of the house about the timetabling of legislation, but denied insulting her personally.He was accused of having said in an aside that Leadsom was a “stupid woman”, and swearing before describing her as “useless”, prompting Downing Street to say such language would be unacceptable.In his complaint letter on Tuesday, Duddridge wrote: “I am writing in order to make a formal complaint concerning the behaviour of the Speaker, the Rt Hon John Bercow MP, on Wednesday 16th May 2018, and his comments concerning the Leader of the House, the Rt Hon Andrea Leadsom MP.“He is alleged to have called her a “f****** stupid woman” and a “liar”. He has not denied these allegations. I would ask that primary video and audio footage is examined. I would also ask that this footage is secured immediately as it may be routinely destroyed.”The demand for a fresh investigation into the latest allegations will increase pressure on the Speaker, who has previously faced calls to resign over allegations he bullied staff who worked for him.He has denied the historic claims and the Commons’ standards committee announced last week that the watchdog would not investigate them further. Duddridge, one of a large band of Conservative critics of the Speaker, suggested he should stand down in June, after originally pledging to serve nine years in the role. However, Bercow was re-elected uncontested after the 2015 and 2017 general elections, suggesting that the pledge had expired. In his letter, seen by the , Duddridge wrote: “I would like to also request a call for evidence in relation to intimidating behaviour which I and other members have witnessed repeatedly over the years.“It is essential that the Speaker steps aside from chairing and participating on all matters related to bullying.”Bercow told MPs on Monday he had been frustrated with the timetabling of legislation when he uttered the word “stupid”. He added: “It was in that context, and that context alone, that, having expressed my displeasure about the matter quite forcefully from the chair, I used the word ‘stupid’ in a muttered aside. “That adjective simply summed up how I felt about the way that that day’s business had been conducted.”It is understood that Leadsom did not complain to the parliamentary standards commissioner about the alleged comments because she did not want to jeopardise her independent complaints and grievance policy. The final proposals, which are due out before the summer recess in July, have to be signed off by the House of Commons commission, which is chaired by Bercow.The Speaker’s spokeswoman said he would not be commenting beyond what he had said in the Commons on Monday. The standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, could not be contacted for comment.

Overall, people expressed their thanks only once in every 20 occasions.Rather than reflecting manners, or a descent into rudeness, the findings say more about linguistic traditions, the researchers said. Across cultures, close-knit groups of people take it for granted that people will cooperate with each other, to the point that saying thanks is no longer needed.“In informal everyday interaction across the world, the general norm is to respond to another’s cooperative behaviour without explicitly saying thank you, but by simply continuing with one’s activities,” the scientists say in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The researchers studied 1,057 conversations recorded by fixed cameras and microphones in people’s homes or in places where the communities gathered. All the exchanges were casual and between people who knew each other well, such as friends and family. In more formal settings, such as buying food at the shops, the scientists believe expressions of thanks are likely to be far more commonplace.The scientists cast a wide net to capture any phrase that indicated thanks when someone did what was asked of them. In English, that meant terms like “sweet” and “good job” as well as “thank you”. In Murrinh-Patha, it included phrases such as “Yukuy murruwurInyima”, which translates as “That’s right, you’re beautiful”.“This doesn’t mean that people are universally rude, nor that speakers of English are less rude than speakers of other languages,” said Nick Enfield, a lead researcher on the study at the University of Sydney. “We should not conflate the feeling of gratitude with the act of expressing it.”What the study leaves open is why people say thank you on the rare occasions they do. One idea the researchers propose is that saying thanks is reserved for when requests go beyond the call of duty. “In everyday interaction, cooperation is the rule: social life thrives because it’s in our nature to ask for help and pay back in kind, rather than just in words,” said Enfield. “There is literally an unspoken agreement that people will cooperate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e56de9b27816dd577d41f3fc8474825f366b83e/0_83_1945_1167/master/1945.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3aa94bcafb03ab2ee64f67bc619c2d9","title":"one in eight people set to have type 2 diabetes by 2045 says study","story":"One in eight people in the world will have type 2 diabetes by 2045 if obesity continues to climb at the present rate, according to a new study.The institutions collaborated to launch the Cities Changing Diabetes programme in 2014 to accelerate the global fight against urban diabetes. The program began with eight cities: Copenhagen, Rome, Houston, Johannesburg, Vancouver, Mexico City, Tianjin and Shanghai. These have since been joined by a further seven cities: Beijing, Buenos Aires, Hangzhou, Koriyama, Leicester, Mérida and Xiamen.“These numbers underline the staggering challenge the world will face in the future in terms of numbers of people who are obese, or have type 2 diabetes, or both. As well as the medical challenges these people will face, the costs to countries’ health systems will be enormous,” said Dr Alan Moses of Novo Nordisk Research and Development in Søborg, Denmark. “The global prevalence of obesity and diabetes is projected to increase dramatically unless prevention of obesity is significantly intensified. Developing effective global programs to reduce obesity offer the best opportunity to slow or stabilise the unsustainable prevalence of diabetes. The first step must be the recognition of the challenge that obesity presents and the mobilisation of social service and disease prevention resources to slow the progression of these two conditions.”“Each country is different based on unique genetic, social and environmental conditions which is why there is no ‘one size fits all’ approach that will work. Inidual countries must work on the best strategy for them,” said Moses.The tide could be turned, he said, “but it will take aggressive and coordinated action to reduce obesity and inidual cities should play a key role in confronting the issues around obesity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6513e88afe04f558c40693d7e6fce786cad9413f/0_165_4938_2963/master/4938.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c07eb699db24e0e5ef4a836743f779e","title":"the friend effect why the secret of health and happiness is surprisingly simple","story":"For some, eating alone can be a joyous thing: forking mouthfuls of pasta straight from the pan, peanut butter licked off a spoon, the unbridled pleasure of walking home from the chippie alone on a cold night. But regularly eating meals in isolation is a different story. This one factor is more strongly associated with unhappiness than any other apart from (unsurprisingly) having a mental illness. This is according to a\u0026nbspnew study by Oxford Economics that found, in a survey of 8,250 British adults, that people who always eat alone score 7.9 points lower, in terms of happiness, than the national average.This research is far from the first to suggest a link between eating with others and happiness. Researchers at the University of Oxford last year found that the more that people eat with others, the more likely they are to feel happy and satisfied with their lives. The study also found that people who eat socially are more likely to feel better about themselves and have wider social and emotional support networks.Robin Dunbar, a professor of psychology, worked on the Oxford University study. He says that “we simply don’t know” why people who eat together are happier. But it is clear that this is a regular social ritual, a\u0026nbspmoment of union and communion in our often chaotic lives. It can be a place of conversation, storytelling and closeness.“At a psychological level, having friends just makes you happier,” says Dunbar. “The kinds of things that you do around the table with other people are very good at triggering the endorphin system, which is part of the brain’s pain-management system. Endorphins are opioids, they are chemically related to morphine – they are produced by the brain and give you an opiate high. That’s what you get when you do all this social stuff, including patting, cuddling and stroking. It is central to the way primates in general bond in their social groups and relationships.”Our face-to-face relationships are, quite literally, a matter of life or death. “One of the biggest predictors of physical and mental health problems is loneliness,” says Dr Nick Lake, joint director for psychology and psychological therapy at Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. “That makes sense to people when they think of mental health. But the evidence is also clear that if you are someone who is lonely and isolated, your chance of suffering a major long-term condition such as coronary heart disease or cancer is also significantly increased, to the extent that it is almost as big a\u0026nbsprisk factor as smoking.”One of the most striking pieces of evidence for this, says Dunbar, is a meta-analysis of 148 epidemiological studies that looked\u0026nbspfor the best predictors that patients would survive for 12 months\u0026nbspafter a heart attack. “The best two predictors, by a long way, are the number and quality of friends you have and giving up smoking,” he says. “You can eat as much as you like, you can slob about, you can drink as much alcohol as you like – the effect is very modest compared with these other two\u0026nbspfactors.”Human beings are biologically engineered for human interaction – and particularly face-to-face interaction. One study from the University of Michigan found that replacing face-to-face contact with friends and family with messages on social media, emails or text messages could double our risk of depression. The study also found that those who made social contact with family and friends at least three times a week had the lowest level of\u0026nbspdepressive\u0026nbspsymptoms.“The ability to stimulate positive emotions, which is linked to happiness, begins in interactions with others who are having positive emotions about you. So, when we see our friends and they say, ‘Good to see you’ – it’s important.”But there are many factors that might prevent us from seeing friends and family: mental ill health, immobility, a lack of money. Alison Harris is a consultant clinical psychologist and professional lead for psychological services at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust in Greater Manchester. “Austerity has a huge influence on the loss of happiness and wellbeing,” she says. “Homelessness and unemployment in particular takes us out of contact with others. In addition to the obvious harms of homelessness, it does massively increase social isolation and anxiety. To take that even further, many people are in exile from their communities. In mental health services, we see an enormous amount of grief, depression and anxiety in people who are asylum seekers and refugees and much of that is not just due to trauma or torture or detention or fleeing from their country, but from the severe rupture of being cut off from their families and communities of origin.”When we are around others, it has an effect on our body. Some forms of friendship – going to parties, getting married, having positive interactions with others – stimulate our sympathetic nervous system. Gilbert says that the parasympathetic nervous system (otherwise known as the “rest and digest” system) “is stimulated through the verbal and voice tone of relations with each other. As far as we know, it’s not that stimulated through texts. Generally speaking, you’re designed to respond to voice tone and expression, and stroking. We are physiologically designed for face-to-face interaction.”Of course, for those struggling with depression, the idea of physical contact can be impossible to fathom. At those moments, the capacity to lift up a mobile phone and type out a text is an enormous mark of progress. It may not be the ideal form of interaction, but it’s a vast improvement on staring at a wall.He says that what has happened in the past decade, with the rise of social media, “is that it has become a\u0026nbspvery plastic society. We are all living like theatrical actors, presenting ourselves as our best. That can’t be real, and so we have many people who feel like failures or useless. They say: ‘I’m not as attractive as that, I’m overweight, I’m not kind or compassionate to\u0026nbspothers.’”As Gilbert says, the best relationships are the ones where people love us for our perceived dark sides and flaws. “People forget that love is about loving you for the difficult things, not the easy things,” he says. It is those who know us intimately who can provide that, and they do it through their physical presence, through touch, and through eating, drinking and sharing with us. Spending time together is social nourishment. So, instead of texting a friend or messaging them on social media, why not knock on their door, look them in the eye and make yourselves both feel better?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0ba09cd28532872e30ea8f03de765ca0b4d2f6e/641_174_4050_2431/master/4050.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d746b995b0a5bf1828b4bf139fdc436","title":"andrew strauss andy flower england compassionate leave","story":"Andrew Strauss is to take a summer-long break from his role as director of England cricket with Andy Flower stepping into the breach as a temporary replacement.The former England captain’s wife, Ruth, was diagnosed with cancer last December and is due to begin a new treatment at the end of this week. With that in mind, Strauss has been granted a period of compassionate leave to offer his full support.Strauss, who was appointed three years ago, said: “Andy Flower is going to be stepping in for me over the course of the summer. We all know about his qualities and his experience of both England and English cricket and he will fill in my shoes very adequately.“ I look forward to returning and grabbing the reins again but at this period of time my focus has to be on supporting Ruth and my family at a challenging time for us.”Since standing down as England’s Test team director after the 2013-14 Ashes whitewash Flower has been operating in a number of roles behind the scenes, first as the head of elite coaching before taking over as head coach of the Lions set-up.Strauss has continued his running of the senior England teams during the early stages of his wife’s diagnosis and has recently introduced a new selection system, with Ed Smith taking charge of the panel and now six new scouting roles handed to Marcus Trescothick, Glen Chapple, Steve Rhodes, Richard Dawson, Chris Read and James Taylor.“They will be compiling reports on players of interest to us,” said Strauss. “But they won’t compile reports on their own players, if they are involved in a county.

Moreover Dumoulin’s Sunweb team do not seem to have enough climbing strength to put Yates’s Mitchelton-Scott team under pressure.Amid his obvious pleasure at retaining the pink jersey for the 10th day, Yates said his tactical plan would change. Having focused on attacking to gain time to create a cushion for Tuesday’s stage, he can now ride more conservatively. “It changes my tactics for the next few days. Unfortunately for the fans it means I can be a lot more defensive, all the way to Rome. Sorry guys.” As he noted, his stage win on Sunday, where he gained 47sec on Dumoulin, was critical in giving him the lead he now enjoys.Over a largely flat course through the vineyards that line the valley of the river Adige – and alongside the motorway that runs south out of Trento, this was far from the “kicking” predicted by Yates’s directeur sportif, Matt White, but it was by no means a straightforward process for the Briton. He never looked entirely comfortable on his time-trial bike, in stark contrast to Dumoulin’s smooth, unflustered style.The risk Yates ran, as all climbers do in this kind of stage, were exemplified by the fortunes of Thibaut Pinot, a past winner of the French national time trial title and a contender for the podium in this Giro until this stage. Here, a catastrophic performance meant he dropped to fifth overall.The top three on the stage were specialists, led by Dennis, who had targeted the opening time trial in Jersusalem, where he finished second to Dumoulin, although that ride enabled him to snatch the pink jersey in the opening week. It is a welcome result for the BMC team, which is searching for a new sponsor after the death of its founder and long-time backer Andy Rihs, and it hoisted him to sixth overall.The former world champion Tony Martin finished ahead of Dumoulin in second, while Chris Froome’s fourth place on the stage suggests he can still at least target third place, although he has been anything but consistent over the past two and a half weeks. Just behind Froome the Italian national champion, Fabio Aru, created the one major shock with fifth place – surprising for a rider who had looked close to quitting the race on Sunday – while the Essex rider Alex Dowsett posted a respectable seventh.Yates has now opened a healthy gap over the other riders pushing for victory behind Dumoulin: Pozzovivo has slipped to 3min 11sec, Froome is at almost 4min, just ahead of Pinot, which again gives grounds for optimistim.“I’ve got a bigger gap to the guys behind me,” Yates said. “It’s not just Tom he’s at a minute. The guys behind him are at a good gap. There are still some hard days to come. I have to hope I have no bad luck and no bad days.”On Wednesday the race heads through the Italian lake country for a flat finish in Iseo, which will be the final chance for breakaway specialists to target a stage win. That is followed by three mountain-top finishes in succession. Friday and Saturday’s stages to Monte Jafferau and Cervinia look particularly tough, although on paper Yates’s climbing skills should enable him to defend or extend his lead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea5c9edd10142de8da8cdff3b3e18bc2fa290140/136_520_4449_2669/master/4449.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e62089d8d78c158d10dae4b1a22f3e4","title":"own limited edition print sports photographer eamonn mccabe","story":"The award-winning sports photographer Eamonn McCabe, a former  head of photography, looks back at his favourite sporting images from the 1970s and 80s.

The travel guide publisher has attempted to tackle the issue of overtourism in its annual holiday hotlist, by highlighting lesser-visited destinations across the continent.Dundee is Scotland’s fourth largest city and is sixth on Lonely Planet’s Best in Europe 2018 list. It earned the spot for its “head-turning” urban redevelopment, including the transformation of its historic waterfront and the opening of a new branch of the V\u0026ampA this September .Lonely Planet describes it as an “exciting moment” for a city that has often been overlooked by visitors to Scotland, and praised its “nationally important museums and attractions” and “dynamic, creative spirit”.The number one spot went to Emilia-Romagna in Italy. The region was picked out as an alternative to Tuscany, Campania and Veneto, and for its emergence as one of the best foodie spots in the country. Emilia-Romagna is the home of ragù, Parma ham, balsamic vinegar and Parmesan cheese. Recently Bologna, the regional capital, saw the opening of the world’s largest culinary theme park, Fico Eataly, where visitors can sample all manner of local cuisine. Other picks on the list included the wild beaches, mountains and “enchanted” villages of Cantabria, Spain (a far cry from the overcrowded attractions of Barcelona and the Costa del Sol) and Kosovo, which boasts “dramatic hiking trails, Ottoman-era history and a growing cultural scene”. “There is growing concern over the increase in tourism to popular European destinations, particularly over the busy summer months, so with this list we wanted to show that there are a wealth of incredible alternatives to discover across Europe,” said Lonely Planet editorial director, Tom Hall.

Like Ariana Grande.” It is poignant because, even now, these teenagers are able to recapture that sense of anticipation. It is devastating because you know what is coming next.In all, 14,000 people attended Grande’s show at the Manchester Arena on 22 May last year. Manchester: The Night of the Bomb (BBC Two) recounts the events leading up to, and after, the explosion in the foyer that killed 23 people and wounded more than 500. It is a documentary you can watch only with your heart in your throat.Grande performed her last number and walked off stage shortly before 10.30pm, perplexing a lot of her young fans. “It was the Dangerous Woman tour and she hadn’t sung Dangerous Woman,” says Acacia Seward, 12. By the time Grande came out and did the song as an encore, a good proportion of the audience were already making their way through the foyer.The device went off at 10.31pm, while the bomber stood among parents waiting to collect their children. The moment of the explosion is recalled by survivors in a litany of horrifying details. People were lifted off their feet. The doors blew open, then shut themselves. The foyer was filled with a bright white light – “Like snow coming towards you” – and then darkness as it was suffused with smoke. Nuts and bolts from the device ricocheted, making a sound like machine-gun fire. For some victims, the immediate aftermath was eerily silent: their eardrums had been perforated. There was blood everywhere and people struggled to grasp the\u0026nbspextent of their injuries. “I saw my legs were on fire and then I was unconscious,” says Eve Senior, 15.A countdown clock (reminiscent of the one Grande employed as her big entrance approached) winds back to the moment of the explosion for another perspective. Phone footage recorded the panic inside the auditorium, where there was a stampede of people trying to get out\u0026nbsp– running towards the carnage by the exits. In all the\u0026nbspconfusion, rumours about gunmen spread.Winding back again, the documentary adopts the point of view of the emergency services. Four transport police were on duty at Victoria railway station, connected to the arena by a footbridge. They ran toward the scene, in the opposite direction of the fleeing crowds. “If you can imagine hell,” says PC Steve Corke, “times it by a million”.Because of the possibility of secondary devices – there were abandoned bags everywhere – arriving ambulance crews were kept back, even as members of the public ran toward the danger to help. With no proper medical equipment on the scene, the flow of blood was stemmed with Grande T-shirts. Victims had to be ferried to the train station to get medical attention. The safety protocols in place were much criticised after the fact, but the documentary obliges you to experience the confusion, the agonising and frustration over decisions taken, for better or worse, on\u0026nbspthe night.The other main strand of the film concerns the 23rd fatality: 22-year-old Salman Abedi, sliced in two by his own bomb. Born and bred in Manchester, Abedi had returned to the city four days before on a flight from Libya. His parents, who fled Libya during the Gaddafi regime, had recently gone back there to live. A difficult and sometimes violent student, Abedi was fighting on the front line in Libya’s civil war by the age of 17. In the months before the attack, he was living alone in the family home in Manchester. His exact motivations remain opaque, but police say he would have been incapable of making the bomb he used without close guidance. Abedi does not qualify as a victim alongside those he killed, injured and traumatised that night, but he is bound up in the tragedy all the same.Manchester: The Night of the Bomb provides a gruelling evocation of that tragedy. Some of it – such as the recorded announcement still blaring out the words “Attention: due to an incident, it is necessary to evacuate the area” long after the building had been emptied of anyone who could walk – is positively haunting. But it is also, in the end, inspiring, thanks to the determination of those present to tell their stories."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92d657eb2e1cfd93708bdf08574d95dd0f5c10ac/80_246_5246_3146/master/5246.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0195a8d7b960322c70887995112982a8","title":"mike pompeo iran assassination operations europe","story":"The statement bewildered security experts and Iranian exiles, who say they are not aware of any evidence for the allegationMike Pompeo’s claim that the Iran’s Revolutionary Guard is carrying out “assassination operations in the heart of Europe” has bewildered security experts and Iranian exiles, who say they are not aware of any evidence for the allegation.The new US secretary of state referred to the alleged assassinations in his first major speech on Monday, but devoted just a single line to it amid a litany of criticisms of Iranian behaviour, giving no further details. “Today, the Iranian Quds Force conducts covert assassination operations in the heart of Europe,” Pompeo said, referring to the external operations arm of the Islamic revolutionary guards corps (IRGC).Asked about Pompeo’s statement, the state department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, said: “He has information and access to information that I do not. I am not able to comment on that in particular but I can tell the secretary has assured me that there is a basis for that point in his speech and he stands firmly behind that.”US diplomats specialising in Iran were taken by surprise by Pompeo’s allegations.There have been no recent killings in Europe officially attributed to the Iranian state. Iran’s last prime minister under the Shah, Shapour Bakhtiar, was assassinated in France in 1991, and four Iranian Kurdish dissidents were gunned down in a Greek restaurant called Mykonos in Berlin the following year.The court in the Mykonos case issued an international arrest warrant in 1997 for Iran’s then intelligence minister, Hojjat al-Islam Ali Fallahian, but Tehran denied involvement.The 2012 bombing of a bus carrying Israeli tourists in Burgas, Bulgaria, was blamed by the Bulgarian government on the Lebanese militia, Hezbollah, widely viewed as a Iranian client force.Pompeo’s remarks, however, appeared to refer to current rather than past events and singled out the Quds force.The most recent killing of an Iranian dissident took place in The Hague in November last year, when a gunman shot Ahmad Mola Nissi, the leader of an Iranian Arab separatist group in the oil-rich Khuzistan province.The armed wing of Nissi’s movement had claimed responsibility for several attacks in Iran including the deaths of two IRGC guardsmen in January 2017. Nissi’s daughter said in an interview last year that her father’s death was reminiscent of Iranian state killings in 1990s.“Europe seems safe, but be careful. The conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran is not confined to the Middle East. It is spreading into Europe,” Hawra Nissi told Reuters. “The family is open to all scenarios. Iran is a prime suspect, but not the only suspect.”However, the Dutch investigation into the killing has not publicly blamed the IRGC. If Pompeo was referring to the Nissi murder, he was disclosing formerly classified information. Iraj Mesdaghi, a Sweden-based Iranian political activist who spent a decade in jail in Iran from 1981 to 1991, questioned Pompeo’s claim. “It’s unlikely to be true,” said Mesdaghi, a researcher on human rights abuses in Iran who has closely monitored IRGC activities in Europe.  “There is no evidence to back the claim that currently they are carrying out such operations in Europe.” Mesdaghi said the IRGC or Quds Force have not been officially blamed for any assassinations in Europe since the Mykonos trial. Mesdaghi said Iran is suspected to have carried out at least a couple more such attacks since Mykonos, such as the killing near Paris of the former cabinet member Reza Mazlouman. But he said such assassinations appeared to have stopped after the end of Mykonos trial in 1997. “Europe made it clear after Mykonos that such assassinations are a red line for the continent,” he said. Mesdaghi said no links have been established so far to tie Iran to Nissi’s death. “It would be very unusual for Iran to have carried out his killing given the relationship they have with Europe now and the fact that Nissi was not influential, nor important enough,” he said.Shashank Joshi, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London said: “Iran conducted a wave of assassinations across Europe in the 1990s, and the Iran-backed militant group Hizbullah is widely thought to have been responsible for the Burgas attack in 2012 as retaliation for Israeli targeting of Iranian nuclear scientists.”But, as for the Nissi killing, Joshi said: “There is no public evidence to weigh these claims and European officials have been silent.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae28d8a7cd441defb78f034e7ebcfb2932a3d545/0_79_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20693fad046c633f92ab407357cbcc54","title":"uk urged to sanction top putin oligarchs as new powers take effect","story":"Follow US lead and seize assets of Russians accused of human rights abuses, say campaignersBritain should target high-profile Russians with economic sanctions soon after so-called Magnitsky powers passed by parliament come into force, according to campaigners and MPs who supported the introduction of the legislation in the wake of the Salisbury poisoning.Bill Browder called on the government to implement “swift and robust action” against iniduals. The financier, who supports the introduction of sanctions against Russians accused of violating human rights, added that “top Putin oligarchs should be on that list”.The campaigner and the CEO of the investment fund Hermitage Capital Management did not name oligarchs he believed should be targeted.He said similar action in the US “definitely affected the psychology of Putin, and if the British government were to do anything less it would tell Russia it can keep killing people on British soil. The US has shown the way.”The sanctions and anti-money laundering bill, which receives royal assent on Wednesday, contains a Magnitsky amendment, named after a whistleblower who died in custody in Moscow in 2009. It gives the UK the power to target iniduals accused of “gross human rights violations” and seize their assets, raising the prospect of the British government acting shortly thereafter.John Penrose, a Conservative backbencher and former minister, also said it was time for the UK to follow the US lead. “Given the extensive intelligence sharing and security co-operation between Britain and USA, if we don’t announce our own sanctions pretty soon it will look extremely odd. The UK needs to publish a British equivalent of the US’s list right now.”The original Magnitsky list was introduced in the US under Obama, and enabled it to withhold visas and freeze the assets of iniduals named. It originally cited dozens of iniduals involved in the case of Sergei Magnitsky but has since been expanded to encompass other countries and many more iniduals, who are prevented from doing business with US companies or citizens.Britain is one of the last countries to introduce a similar approach, but at the beginning of May the Conservatives and Labour agreed to support a Magnitsky amendment in the aftermath of the Salisbury poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. The passage of the amendment was described by the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, as “an important moment” that would “allow UK to act against those responsible for serious offences worldwide”.On Monday, Johnson hinted that UK action could come soon and he was examining the approach taken by the Trump administration: “The truth is actually that I think the effect of some of those sanctions, particularly on some iniduals, has been very marked and I’ve noted that, but we have our own systems and our own approach and we have to do it in accordance with the law and accordance with the evidence.”The US version of the legislation sanctioned aluminium billionaire Oleg Deripaska. Since the US sanctions were announced Deripaska has said that he is prepared to give up a majority stake in EN+, a London listed holding company for his metals interests. The oligarch has also stepped down from the board of the company, whose share price tumbled after the Trump administration said it would target him.In an unrelated hearing at the high court earlier in May, Deripaska denied the “alleged basis for the imposition of sanctions against me”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/083c903b5bbea333acbe5181422718c9a615811f/0_1518_2585_1551/master/2585.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ff93a627d63aa0f9aabfa71fdc9a27d","title":"wednesday briefing oxford told to open the door wider","story":"Colleges still accept too few minority students … scorcher of a bank holiday weekend coming up … and the case for DIY ethical pensionsColleges still accept too few minority students … scorcher of a bank holiday weekend coming up … and the case for DIY ethical pensionsHello – I’m Warren Murray, welcome to your mid-week briefing.Oxford University has admitted it is falling short on ersity as figures show more than one in four of its colleges failed to admit a single black British student each year between 2015 and 2017. White British applicants were twice as likely to be admitted to undergraduate courses as their black British peers.Releasing the figures, Oxford said it recognised the need to make more progress and was adding 500 more places to its spring and summer school programme for students from under-represented backgrounds. Wadham stands out as one Oxford college that has made inroads by admitting more state school students.

Photograph: Trevor McBride. “When I’m in Muff we pray for the President, and when I’m in Culmore we pray for the Queen.”For Archdeacon Robert Miller, that is the only difference between his parish in Donegal and his three in Derry.The rector of Christ Church, St Peter’s and Culmore in Derry City, and Muff in Co Donegal, Archdeacon Miller laughs at the idea of having an “international ministry” given the cross-Border nature of his work.With Brexit looming, he admits there is uncertainty among some in his parishes around what may come, but he says that for the church “the Border doesn’t really exist”.“I have joked that I hope I won’t need my passport to go to Muff on a Sunday morning,” he says, “but the reality is that we’ve been here before with Border checkpoints and crossings and during that time Muff and Culmore related and worked together, so I would be hopeful that whatever happens, we’ll manage.”Culmore is about 3km from Muff. The journey between the two takes less than five minutes and only the changing road signs and a poster erected by the Border Communities Against Brexit campaign group, marking the Border’s location, suggest that you have moved from Northern Ireland to the Republic.There may be complications down the line if a political agreement on Brexit is not reached but Archdeacon Miller says the Church of Ireland existed long before there was any Border.“We predate partition, and the reality then was that the Church of Ireland had to negotiate something that was imposed upon it and which put a Border between some of its dioceses,” says Archdeacon Miller.“But the Church of Ireland is a church of the whole island, and whilst obviously we acknowledge the secular way in which the island is ided, the Church of Ireland operates as a whole-island church.“If you talk to people they’ll say that the reality of the matter is that at partition a line was drawn on a map – and especially during the Troubles things were very, very difficult – but the relationships existed and persisted.”Archdeacon Miller ministers to about 330 families across the four parishes. He says his responsibility is to provide pastoral support for his parishioners throughout the challenges posed by Brexit.“I don’t do down the uncertainty, because certainly for people who are farming, or people whose business causes them to go back and forth across the Border, or even those who work in one or both of the currencies and then have to cross the Border, all of this causes uncertainty for them,” he says.“Each generation will have its own challenge, and in some ways our challenge is Brexit.”The archdeacon says that while it is not the church’s role to have an opinion on Brexit, its responsibility is to react to people’s concerns.“In terms of peacebuilding, you’re always aware that a change in the status quo at the minute could be a difficult thing,” he says. “For people who have lived on the Border for 40-plus years of troubles, that would be a concern if there was an attempt to reimpose it, but it does seem that it will be a soft Border.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3504823.1527018838!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"retain eighth campaign seeks to shift key message as vote looms","story":"The Government\u0027s draft legislation on abortion allows for termination of pregnancy up to 12 weeks, but how did they come to this decision?\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRetainers know, as do repealers, that if the public mind is focused on allowing for abortion in cases of rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities, the proposition will be carried.Although Keith Redmond is never shy about sharing his opinion, the phone call asking him to record a campaign video outlining his concerns about the Government’s abortion proposals came as a surprise.Redmond, a councillor in Fingal, was a member of the Progressive Democrats before joining Fine Gael, which he left in 2015 to join Renua, the anti-abortion party founded by Lucinda Creighton.He is now an Independent and is a voluble presence on social media, where he has been arguing recently that while he favours some reform of Ireland’s abortion laws, what is being proposed – unrestricted abortion up to 12 weeks of pregnancy – is too much.About a fortnight ago, Redmond received a call from a figure from the Pro Life Campaign, which is campaigning under the “Love Both” banner in the referendum.“They said, ‘Your message will resonate with a middle ground of people.’ It was to speak to a different cohort of people.”The video, recorded at Redmond’s home in Howth, Co Dublin, was only posted on social media channels in recent days. The accompanying #toofarforme Twitter hashtag is a clear indication of where the No side in the referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution wants the battle to be fought as polling day approaches on Friday.“I’m actually in favour of abortion in certain circumstances,” Redmond says in the video. “But I am voting No in the upcoming referendum. The current proposal from the Government is just too extreme. I believe we need to look at the Eighth, but this isn’t the way to do it.”The shift in messaging, always likely as the campaign entered its final week, was, according to those on the No side, partly planned and partly developed as a result of canvass returns.It has become an obvious theme in recent days, with suggestions now being made that the Government could come back to the people with a proposal that is not as liberal as repealing the Eighth Amendment and introducing legislation to allow for abortion up to 12 weeks.So obvious, in fact, that Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald invited Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to state in the Dáil on Tuesday that there is no way to retain the Eighth and also deal with cases of fatal foetal abnormalities, or the terminations of pregnancies resulting from rape. Varadkar duly obliged.“It was always one of a number of options for the final week, along with trusting politicians,” one No source said of the new emphasis. “It’s kind of emerged organically as an issue on the doorsteps and is the strongest mover of voters in focus groups.”It has been driven towards one cohort of voters in particular. Research, not only from focus groups but from online sources such as Facebook and Google, too, has led No campaigners to identify “soft” Yes voters among women who are already mothers.Although it has been extremely difficult to segregate voters into distinct groupings, No campaigners say they still have to try. New ads were made to target the “soft” Yes mothers, and others in the middle who will decide the result.“It so much depends on what message the public are listening to in the last few days,” says another figure on the No side, who maintains the “hard cases have been overemphasised by the media”.Retainers know, as do repealers, that if the public mind is focused on allowing for abortion in cases of rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities, the proposition will be carried.One No source even suggested that Yes could win by 10 points or more if that is where the debate remains until Friday. But the same person argued that No could win by five points if the argument is fought on 12 weeks, “abortion on demand” and #toofarforme.Redmond’s experience of being cold-called suggests that Love Both is aware of that argument, but others advocating a No vote are not so sure.Rabbitte is campaigning for No but says abortion should be permitted in cases of rape, incest or when there is a diagnosis of a fatal foetal abnormality.The Galway East TD told both Save the Eighth and Love Both they needed to show some more compassion in dealing with these arguments, but says she was met with different responses.“In fairness to Save the Eighth, they want to save the Eighth,” she said of the group which was more receptive. Love Both, she said, “told me to stick to the script”, adding: “They are so entrenched.”Other Fianna Fáilers in favour of a No vote believe the tactical change has arrived far too late in the campaign. One possible approach, argued a party TD, would have been to publish an alternative constitutional amendment and make it central to the referendum debate.“That might have worked. There is the argument now that the Government should come back with a better question, but it should have been done earlier.”Yet, against the background noise of the change in tactics, it is hard not to detect a rising pessimism among those on the No side.Phrases such as “the country is in flux” and “Ireland has changed” find their way to the lips of leading No campaigners when they speak privately.Canvasses have become harder, although it is argued that this is due to a move from what were perceived to be safer areas for the No message to more difficult, “swing” towns, villages and suburbs.The most striking aspect of canvassing, says one source, is the number of people who will not even answer their doors. “It’s the same on the Yes side too. A lot of undecided voters are quietly making up their minds.”To have any chance of victory, No must be successful in convincing the middle ground that the Government’s proposal goes too far, and that an alternative is possible.Even if that argument reaches its audience, success is not guaranteed.“Let’s be honest here,” remarked a prominent retainer. “We haven’t been ahead in one poll. We need an inside straight to pull this off.”Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum here"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3503528.1526934314!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"westminster committee urges may to take more active role in north","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May was urged by the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster to take a more active role in Northern Ireland’s affairs until devolved institutions there are restored.  Photograph: EPAThe Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster has called on Theresa May’s government to take a more active role in the affairs of Northern Ireland until the devolved institutions there are restored.In a report, Devolution and Democracy in Northern Ireland – Dealing with the Deficit, to be published on Tuesday, the committee also urges an early return to talks to restore the Executive and Assembly.“Karen Bradley is right to make restoring power-sharing devolved government in Stormont her first priority. However, while the political impasse continues the list of policy obstructions and project delays grows and becomes more serious,” committee chair Andrew Murrison said.“We believe the Secretary of State is correct to insist that any decisions from Westminster align with the principles of the Good Friday Agreement. Helpfully, some GFA-compliant guidance already exists. For example, the Hart Report makes policy recommendations that were broadly welcomed across the community.“Elsewhere, the Secretary of State will need to develop stronger ways of engagement and consider new measures to secure adequate scrutiny. Our recommendations include a committee system at Stormont as a temporary expedient pending restoration of the Executive.”Some members of the committee, including Labour’s Kate Hoey and the DUP’s Ian Paisley, have criticised the way the Belfast Agreement operates and the report calls for a consultation between London, Dublin and Belfast on how it might be improved. The report suggests that such a consultation should review how the power-sharing system works and if and how it should be changed.“The Good Friday Agreement has had a transformative effect on Northern Ireland. However, its institutions have collapsed and even if restarted tomorrow would likely remain fragile,” Dr Murrison said.“With the involvement and consent of the whole community in Northern Ireland, we have to consider if they can be more robust and how improvements can be made, as envisaged in the agreement itself. We must investigate every avenue to secure long-term stable government. For political stalemate to become the new normal is unthinkable and unacceptable.”-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3503426.1526927646!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tory brexiteers should hope for another election and soon","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSir Ivan Rogers, who resigned as Britain’s diplomatic emissary to the EU in January last year. Photograph: Thierry RogeEPAIt was a long, repetitive exercise that kept the British establishment waiting some of them willing it on, some of them concealing distaste. Bishop Michael Curry’s sermon at the royal wedding was a truer metaphor for Brexit than any journalist has coined these past two years.As the second anniversary of the referendum nears, there is more exasperated checking of watches left to go. A transition period from membership to non-membership will run until the end of 2020. The latest answer to the customs impasse is continuation of the status quo until 2022, when new technologies might fix the problem. By then, the process of exit will rival the second World War in length. If a technical solution does not emerge, Britain’s holding pen could become a permanent home.There is also a new immigration system to decide, as well as the UK’s freedom of manoeuvre on state aid and other regulatory matters. Whatever Britain does in these areas could affect the terms it secures in the trade talks that constitute yet another avenue of negotiation with the EU. In all likelihood, London will be haggling with Brussels over one thing or another indefinitely, much like the Swiss. Ivan Rogers predicted this future when he quit as Britain’s diplomatic emissary to the EU after the referendum.It is not clear that Britain will turn on Brexit as young voters replace old. Demography is not destiny. Even if it were, it is slow to work. All the same, Leavers should worry about the passage of time. The drop in European immigration that is already showing up in data could blunt the public’s main grievance against the EU. Endless negotiations could themselves accustom voters to a kind of rolling semi-membership. If a clean exit is to happen, it has to happen before long.At the risk of riling Brenda of Bristol, the voter whose fatigue at hearing the news of last year’s general election became a viral hit, the best hope for Tory Leavers is another election, and soon. A plan leaked over the weekend envisages a vote of no-confidence in prime minister Theresa May, before an autumn date with the electorate, perhaps under the leadership of Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary and committed Leaver.A new election is not certain to fix the Leavers’ central problem, which is the shortage of parliamentary numbers for their preferred exit. But the potential is there. Two favourable circumstances obtain right now that might not in a few years. One is material. The economy is still growing, with wages rising ahead of inflation. If the business cycle turns before Britain leaves, the animal spirits behind Brexit could weaken. A downturn has the power to frustrate Brexit in a way no human factor can. It is one thing to vote Leave, and another to leave while the economy is fragile.The other tailwind is political. The opposition Labour party still wants to leave the single market. As stable as this seems, Leavers cannot treat it as an immovable fact of politics. They are in parliamentary trouble because the opposition line is already softer than it was at the turn of the year. If it softens much more, a hard exit becomes a fringe prospect.In other words, this apparent rough patch for Leavers is, on second glance, much better than things might be in the near future. The Conservatives are in reasonable shape after the local elections this month. Some voting-intention polls have them ahead. Other surveys show that voters trust them over other parties to negotiate exit.Most Tories dismiss the weekend speculation out of hand. A snap election seems implausible. But the same was true five minutes before May called one last spring, at which point such insurmountable barriers as the Fixed Term Parliaments Act were breezily surmounted. Given the delicate balance of forces in the House of Commons right now, it would take a small shift in their favour to smooth the way to a clean exit.The Eurosceptic dread was never a formal annulment of the decision to leave. No government could do such a thing without inciting half the nation. Their real nightmare is a prolonged exit that ultimately obscures the difference between leaving and staying. This explains their impatience to leave now, and to elect a parliament to that end.On the balance of probabilities, they will fail. May should see out the year, and the process of exit. But that balance is finer than generally believed, and liable to change with events. The parliamentary deadlock is real. The answer is the long grass or to consult the country. Voters who were not exasperated by last year’s election might yet have their patience tested with a fifth major democratic event in as many years.

discovered orbiting wrong way near jupiter","story":"Images of asteroid 2015 BZ509, which appears to have come from another star systemAn alien asteroid from another star system has been discovered sharing Jupiter\u0027s orbit. Through a telescope the asteroid look like every other in the solar system save for one crucial difference - it is travelling in the wrong direction.It is the first time an interstellar space rock has been found to be permanently residing in the solar system. Earlier this year, a tumbling cigar-shaped object named \u0027Oumuamua\u0027, hit the headlines after flying into earth\u0027s galactic backyard, but it merely passed through and out again.But the new 1.8 mile wide rock - code-named 2015 BZ509 - appears to be a long-term resident, according to a study in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.The first clue that it was not a native of the solar system came from its retrograde orbit of the sun, the opposite the direction of travel taken by all the planets and almost every other object in our system.Scientists have concluded it survived by orbiting the sun exactly in step with Jupiter, but in the opposite directionDr Fathi Namouni, from the Cote d\u0027Azur Observatory in France, lead author of the study, said: How the asteroid came to move in this way while sharing Jupiter\u0027s orbit has until now been a mystery.If 2015 BZ509 were a native of our system, it should have had the same original direction as all of the other planets and asteroids, inherited from the cloud of gas and dust that formed them.Scientists have concluded it survived by orbiting the sun exactly in step with Jupiter, but in the opposite direction.Co-author Dr Helena Morais, from the Estadual Paulista University in Brazil, said: The close proximity of the stars, aided by the gravitational forces of the planets, help these systems attract, remove, and capture asteroids from one another.Computer simulations suggest that the asteroid made the jump to our solar system 4.5 billion years ago when the sun was part of a tightly packed star cluster.“That was completely unexpected...it means it is an alien to the solar system,” said Dr Namouni.Since asteroids and comets carry organic chemicals and water, the discovery could shed light on the origins of life on Earth, the scientists believe.Please review our commenting policyDuke and

Ramadan in Dalston, east London, have said the currency is halal if it is transacted in a lawful manner. There has been significant debate about cryptocurrency in the Muslim world, with figures including the Mufti of Egypt suggesting it is haram, or forbidden, because it is used by some for illegal activity. Because of its anonymous nature bitcoin has become associated with buying drugs and other unlawful items online. But the mosque has declared that Muslims can use it for their Ramadan donation, known as zakat. Muslims are meant to give away 2.5 per cent of their wealth to charity during Ramadan, an annual donation which is compulsory for all but the poorest Muslims. The mosque, also known as Shacklewell Lane Mosque, will accept donations in two different cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum. It has received advice from Shoreditch startup Combo Innovation, a blockchain company which focuses on Islamic finance.The money is used to carry out repairs at the mosque, offer help to families who are struggling to pay funeral costs and shelter and feed the poor. Zayd al Khair, a religious adviser at the mosque, said: Any money or currency is neither halal – permissible – nor haram – impermissible. Guidance is about the value which it represents.  If money is transacted in a lawful manner then it is halal. We do not always know the source of cash donations, but we take these in good faith too.Duke and Duchess of Sussex make first appearance as a married couple at Prince Charles\u0026#39 70th birthday partyMeghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding speeches: The most

takes account accusations used children advertising","story":"Instagram midwife and mother Clemmie Hooper has defended herself against criticismFour beautiful daughters, a perfect home and endless trips abroad have earned Clemmie Hooper almost 500,000 followers on social media and a reputation as one of the most influential Insta-mums. But despite the glamorous lifestyle that being an influencer has afforded the midwife and blogger, her account has now disappeared from Instagram amid rows over using her children in advertising. Mrs Hooper, 33, one of the most followed mothers on the social networking site, has been accused of taking part in ethically dubious postings under her instagram persona mother of daughters. She has defended herself on a Mumsnet discussion, telling users: I don’t feel I ‘sell’ my children to make money, I actually hardly ever feature the older girls and have changed my approach when working with brands eg I won’t feature a picture of my children alone for an AD and I always ask ‘do they need to be in the post at all?’Using the name anyalovesrose she added: I said I hardly ever feature them. They also see and give consent to any post where there are in the picture.But users replied saying that it was morally wrong and as children they were not able to give consent or understand what it meant. A post of Mrs Hooper and her twin daughters on InstagramUser MarshaBradyo added: Selling children doesn’t just mean using them in an ad. It’s also using them as content to the extent that it brings in £.On Monday , a week after engaging in the discussion, Mrs Hooper deactivated her social media site.Nearly 470,000 people followed her Instagram page, which was full of stories of family life and the pitfalls of parenting her daughters Anya, Marnie, Ottilie and Delilah, aged between two and 10. Her husband Simon, who posts under the name  “Father of Daughters” and has almost 850,0000 followers on Instagram, also regularly posts images of the family including advertising. The couple, who run a limited company together, have repeatedly claimed that talking openly they are talking openly about their failings as it important as it helps the enormous number of fellow parents who follow them. But as they declare on their posts, they are actually partnered with a number of brands including Pampers and Dorset Cereals and their Instagram show that it also allows them to live a glamorous lifestyle. Clemmie and Simon Hooper chronicle their lives on social mediaPhotographs of a family holiday in Florida are labelled as a partnership with Visit Florida, which Mrs Hooper described as a work trip in an interview, whilst the couple spent time in Madagascar in October. Their social media profiles have also acted as a springboard for the couple to write three books between them about pregnancy and parenting. Mr Hooper,  a 35-year-old management consultant, is taking part in a social experiment whereby Renault have placed a camera in his car for a year. Mr Hooper then posts videos of family trips - tagged as being a paid partnership with Renault UK - including one in which he says that it is really the only place he can had one on one time with his daughters. Recent Mumsnet posts from Mrs Hooper reveal that it is not just on blogs where the ethics of posting images of their children are discussed as a photographs of one of her daughters on a potty was one I wasn’t happy with him posting I felt it crossed the line, she revealed. When asked why she did not demand he remove it she replied: The reason I felt it wasn’t wise to have it taken down was I felt it would only anger people and fuel more threads so I remained silent and never mentioned it until now. Those close to the midwife, who works on a ward one day a week, say that the de-activation of her Instagram account is likely to only be temporary as she takes a few days breather from online rows. The midwife had also become embroiled in accusations of bullying on her page after her followers repeatedly criticised someone who accused her of hypocrisy. Despite posts suggesting that she had been reported for breaches of the Nursing and Midwifery Council\u0027s social media rules, her employer Kings College Hospital said that it had received no such complaint. Mrs Moody refused to comment on why she had suspended her account. She has faced criticism for featuring her children in her posts for a number of years and has repeatedly defended her decision. Her followers have commented on Mr Hooper\u0027s account asking her to ignore the bullying and come back, with one commenting: People still can\u0027t handle someone being a mother and a professional, and a person in their own right.Justine Roberts, CEO and founder of Mumsnet, said: Many Instagram stars are in our own Influencers Network, we consider them to be Mumsnetters and value them highly.We know that some have taken the feedback on board the criticism of a lack of clarity when it comes to labelling sponsored posts seems to have led to some Instamums being more transparent about sponsorship and advertising, which is great and much appreciated by mums.Duke and Duchess of Sussex make first appearance as a married couple at Prince Charles\u0026#39 70th birthday partyMeghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding speeches: The most moving lines and best jokesInside the royal wedding evening receptionNottingham Cottage: The Kensington home where Meghan and Harry live as a married coupleHow Meghan and Harry\u0026#39s official wedding photographs capture the importance - and joy - of the dayAmazon defends marketing facial recognition tool to police amid privacy concernsNicola Sturgeon warned new Scottish currency would cost up to £300 billionAbortion around world: The countries with most restrictive laws and why debate is back in spotlightUK weather: Temperatures to hit 30c this bank holiday weekendHawaii\u0026#39s Kilauea volcano threatens energy plant as lava oozes nearbyDonald Trump lawyer Michael Cohen\u0026#39s business partner cooperating with prosecutorsManchester attack anniversary: Mass sing-along caps emotional day of tributes to remember city\u0026#39s victimsSave the Children charity \u0026#39tried to shut down\u0026#39 reporting of sexual harassment casesGrammar schools do not help children achieve academic success, study claims Watching one extra junk food a week means 18,000 more calories a year Smart traffic lights which always turn green to be trialled on Britain\u0026#39s roadsHalf of Britons will be obese by 2045Water firms told to leak less as officials warn of widespread droughtCanals prescribed by GPs to combat depression A\u0026ampE Live, review: A deserving salute to the NHS proved unforgivably dull televisionMan sentenced to 25 years for mailing fatal dose of cyanide to BritonCambridge professor accused of being FBI \u0026#39source\u0026#39 in Trump Russia probe was \u0026#39put up for US ambassadorship\u0026#39Judge in New York orders 30-year-old man to leave home after parents take legal action to evict himElderly couple offer reward for car missing in Cheltenham after forgetting where they parked itThe Split, episode 5 recap: this show is chock full of infidelity, but could we still get a happy ending next week?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/22/TELEMMGLPICT000004500061_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqajCpFXsei0OXjDFGPZkcdO8-dd084htGpIKwpmbLWO0.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"might 60 please dont lump together old","story":"We don’t want to be stereotyped as grumpy and glum.

the Prince of Wales, in an affectionate speech in which he teased him about royal life.The Duke told a garden party full of charity guests that they may view the Prince’s enthusiastic handwritten letters with “joy and perhaps trepidation”, ribbing him for celebrating his birthday six months early with the words: “How very Royal!”Wearing a cream dress from British label Goat and Philip Treacey hat, the Duchess appeared to have conformed quickly to the style of Royal women, choosing long sleeves and nude tights for a look noticeably more demure than before her wedding day.Joining her first public engagement as a member of the Royal family, she appeared to get on famously with the Duchess of Cornwall, both failing to suppress their laughter when the Duke’s speech was interrupted by a bee.Prince Charles, with wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwal, and the Duchess of SussexLosing his place half way through, the Duke had waved his hand to swat it away from his ear, telling the crowd: “That bee really got me.”The Duke and Duchess attended their first engagement since the wedding on Saturday to support the Prince at a Buckingham Palace garden party to celebrate his charity work ahead of his 70th birthday.Prince Charles\u0026#039s 70th birthday party pictures: Duke and Duchess of Sussex among the guestsPerhaps mindful of overshadowing him, the couple posed for photographs and spoke to four small groups of people before making a quiet exit.As people congratulated them on their wedding, both politely said “thank you” before moving the conversation on to talk about guests’ charity work.One woman, Sophie Rogers, 26, gave the Duchess what appears to be her first gift as Her Royal Highness: a handmade crystal necklace from her own studio, High Vibe Designs.Ms Rogers had received a grant from The Prince’s Trust two years ago, going on to start her own successful business.“Oh how sweet, thank you,” said the Duchess. “I was just admiring your necklace, it’s beautiful.”Addressing his “Pa” in the only speech of the afternoon, the Duke said: “It really is amazing to see so many of you here today for this family celebration.“I say ‘family’ because this is a chance for us to honour The Prince of Wales\u0027s work over the last forty plus years, with all of his charities, patronages and military associations – and, as you all know, my father views all of your organisations like an extended family.”Telling his father he had been struck by the “long list” of guests invited, and the range of charities the Prince had worked with, he asked 6,000 assembled guests:“Who amongst you has not known the joy, and perhaps trepidation at receiving a handwritten note in response to some news shared from your organisation, urging you on and asking for more to be done to address this issue or that?Guests pose for a photograph as they attend The Prince of Wales\u0026#39 70th Birthday Patronage Celebration held at Buckingham Palace “Who has not come away from a meeting with my father, their head spinning with a dozen new ideas which he wants to get underway urgently, having met a group of people or read something that has fired his imagination and started the flow of ideas.“His enthusiasm and energy are truly infectious it has certainly inspired William and I to get involved in issues we care passionately about and to do whatever we can to make a difference.“In fact, many of the issues William and I now work on are subjects we were introduced to by our father growing up.“His passion and dedication are remarkable and seeing so many of you here today, I cannot fail but to be in awe of the drive he has had for so many years, to contribute to the enrichment of society both in this country and around the world.”The Duke of Sussex\u0026#39s speech was interrupted by a beeAcknowledging the Prince’s instructions that the party should “not be about him”, the Duke added: “So, Pa, while I know that you\u0027ve asked that today not be about you, you must forgive me if I don’t listen to you – much like when I was younger – and instead, I ask everyone here to say a huge thank you to you, for your incredible work over nearly 50 years.“Work that has given self-confidence and opportunity to thousands of young people who might not have had the best start in life Or to champion causes like climate change long before almost anyone else was talking about it and above all, for your vision and ability to bring people together to make change happen.“You have inspired William and I, and looking out here today, it is clear to see that we are not alone.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex leave the garden party“You have created an incredible body of work that has, and will continue to make such a huge difference to so many people\u0027s lives both here and around the world.“With that, Ladies and Gentlemen, please can I ask you to join me in wishing The Prince of Wales a very Happy Birthday – six months ahead of his 70th.“How very Royal.”After finishing the speech, father and son embraced with a kiss on both cheeks, before the four members of the Royal family walked down the steps of Buckingham Palace into the garden to pose for a photograph with charity leaders.The two Duchesses appeared to get on famously, making eye contact and laughing as they were arranged in suitably smart fashion for a photograph.Charles, Camilla, Meghan and Harry pose for a photographWhen Meghan embarked on meeting some charity representatives, she extended her hand to shake before most had a chance to curtsey to her in her new position as HRH.“I knew I was going to curtsey by she shook my hand,” said Diana Langson, from 2nd Battalion Irish Regiment of Canada. “They were both so friendly and so kind and genuine when they spoke.“We offered them congratulations on the wedding and they just said thank you. They’re probably tired of talking about it!“It has been a phenomenal day, and the opportunity to meet them all is overwhelming.”The Duchess of Sussex, who until Saturday was known as Meghan MarkleThe Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall went on to mingle with guests for another hour, treated to a performance of The Goons\u0027 Ying Tong Song by a ukulele orchestra. More than 6,000 people were expected at the garden party, all from the charities and military associations most closely linked with the Prince, on the grounds of Buckingham Palace, for music, speeches and a customary cup of tea.The Duchess of Cornwall attended the garden party at her husband’s side, as he was hailed for his lifetime of work dedicated to the charity sector. The Prince will actually turn 70 on November 14, with this an early public celebration of the milestone. He is expected to have a private party for family and friends closer to the day.The Prince of Wales acknowledges applause from guestsThe attendance of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex reflects both the shared interest of father and son of much of their charity work and the growing bond between the Duchess and her new family.The Duchess, who asked her father-in-law to accompany up part of the aisle for the St George’s Chapel service, is said to have found much common ground with him in a series of private family gatherings.She is likely to have been particularly touched by his chivalry towards her mother, Doria Ragland, during the wedding, where he was seen to reach out his hand to her in the chapel and offer his arm as they walked down the stairs.The Duke, too, has offered an increasingly public insight into his relationship with his father this year, beginning with a interview on the Today programme when Prince Harry acted as guest editor, and continuing with  a joint appearance at a conservation conference.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex with their familyAt the wedding on Saturday, the groom was seen to say “thank you, Pa”, as his father walked Meghan Markle to the altar.Today, the Prince of Wales\u0027 70th Birthday Patronage Celebration will see the Royal family joined by members of the public from 386 of The Prince of Wales\u0027 patronages and 20 of his military affiliations.A number of guests from the emergency services -

And she said future restrictions should also cover streaming platforms, given that around half of television watched by young people is now consumed this way.The study found that on average, young people consumed around 30 unhealthy snacks weekly – taking up around half of their recommended total calorie intake – but just 16 portions of fruit and vegetables.The more junk food advertisements young people watched, the more junk food they ate, with all participants able to recall a favourite advertisement, with those which were catchy and fun standing out.“With today’s teens spending more time in front of screens than any other activity apart from sleeping, curbing exposure to junk food ads on streaming platforms as well as TV will be key to helping teens make healthy diet choices and reducing obesity rates,” Dr Vohra said.Sugar tax | Can it solve the obesity and diabetes epidemics?One third of children are overweight or obese by the time they leave primary school, and two thirds of adults weigh too much, national statistics show.Separate research suggests obese children are around five times more likely to become obese adults with a much higher risk of health problems including 13 cancers, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.Last year, research by the Obesity Health Alliance found that junk food companies in the UK spend £143 million a year on advertising – almost 30 times the £5 million spent annually by the Government on healthy eating campaigns.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Duke and Duchess of Sussex make first appearance as a married couple at Prince Charles\u0026#39 70th birthday partyMeghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding speeches: The most moving lines and best jokesInside the royal wedding evening receptionNottingham Cottage: The Kensington home where Meghan and Harry live as a married coupleHow Meghan and Harry\u0026#39s official wedding photographs capture the importance - and joy - of the dayAmazon defends marketing facial recognition tool to police amid privacy concernsNicola Sturgeon warned new Scottish currency would cost up to £300 billionAbortion around world: The countries with most restrictive laws and why debate is back in spotlightUK weather: Temperatures to hit 30c this bank holiday weekendHawaii\u0026#39s Kilauea volcano threatens energy plant as lava oozes nearbyDonald Trump lawyer Michael Cohen\u0026#39s business partner cooperating with prosecutorsManchester attack anniversary: Mass sing-along caps emotional day of tributes to remember city\u0026#39s victimsSave the Children charity \u0026#39tried to shut down\u0026#39 reporting of sexual harassment casesGrammar schools do not help children achieve academic success, study claims Smart traffic lights which always turn green to be trialled on Britain\u0026#39s roadsWater firms told to leak less as officials warn of widespread droughtHalf of Britons will be obese by 2045Canals prescribed by GPs to combat depression A\u0026ampE Live, review: A deserving salute to the NHS proved unforgivably dull televisionMan sentenced to 25 years for mailing fatal dose of cyanide to BritonCambridge professor accused of being FBI \u0026#39source\u0026#39 in Trump Russia probe was \u0026#39put up for US ambassadorship\u0026#39Judge in New York orders 30-year-old man to leave home after parents take legal action to evict himElderly couple offer reward for car missing in Cheltenham after forgetting where they parked itThe Split, episode 5 recap: this show is chock full of infidelity, but could we still get a happy ending next week?Britain should hold talks with the Taliban to bring peace to Afghanistan, Gavin Williamson saysWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/readmore_card/public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/06/09/1-0.jpg","title":"maduro reelection venezuela deteriorates elections south america","story":"With sickness on the rise, soaring inflation and an infrastructure on the brink of collapse\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspthe socialist nation is at risk of becoming a failed stateVenezuela’s autocratic president, Nicolas Maduro, is widely expected to win another term in elections Sunday. But he soon could face a far bigger test – maintaining his grip on a country that is fast becoming a failed state.Since Maduro took over from Hugo Chavez – his mentor, who died in 2013 – Venezuela’s crisis has steadily intensified as a result of lower oil prices, corruption and a socialist system plagued with mismanagement. But as Maduro has sought to further consolidate power in the past 12 months, the economy, public services, security and health care have all but collapsed. Armed gangs and Colombian guerrilla groups are operating unchecked on Venezuela’s borders. Pro-government militias are terrorising urban areas, while police stand accused of extrajudicial killings. Four of the 10 most dangerous cities in the world are now in Venezuela, according to a 2017 study by the Igarape Institute, a Brazilian think tank that studies violence.Venezuela halts air and sea traffic with three neighbouring countriesHundreds if not thousands of members of the armed forces are deserting, in part due to meagre rations, according to military analysts.Power and water grids and the transportation systems are breaking down. In just the first three months of the year, Venezuela suffered over 7,000 blackouts.Saddled with a soaring inflation rate that has put food out of reach, weakened and thin Venezuelans are falling ill. Doctors say cases of diseases once thought largely eradicated – malaria, diphtheria, measles and tuberculosis – are not only resurfacing but surging. A child stands in front of water containers in Guarenas, VenezuelaIn a nation that lives off oil, production is collapsing as plants break down and the bankrupt government cannot fix equipment. Venezuela’s unpaid creditors are beginning to tighten the financial noose, moving to attach the country’s offshore assets. At the state oil giant, 25,000 workers – more than a quarter of its staff – quit last year in a mass exodus. Fleeing workers are joining a flood of humanity, at least 5,000 people a day, exiting the country. The outflow has left schools without teachers, hospitals without doctors and nurses, and utilities without electricians and engineers. “A failed state is one that cannot meet the most basic functions of government,” says Jean Paul Leidenz, an economist at Ecoanalitica, a Caracas-based analytical firm. Leidenz continues: “Venezuela now certainly has that characteristic.” Buses have become scarce along a Guarenas roadDuring a campaign stop in the eastern Guayana City on Wednesday, Maduro conceded his government “had made mistakes”. But he blamed the country’s crisis mostly on outside forces and domestic enemies and proclaimed the nation’s socialist revolution would see Venezuela through to better days.“Thanks to the social system created by the revolution, the people are protected and prepared,” he says. “We have a lot more to do, and that’s why we need victory.”In her cement block home in eastern Caracas, Zulay Perez, 63, walked into her kitchen and turned on the tap. “See? Nothing,” she says. “No water. No water at all.”For Venezuelans like Perez – the wife of a factory worker – life was never easy. But in the past, she says, the couple would get running water at least a few days each month. This year, they have had water once – and even then for just a few hours. The shortages have spread in 2018, reaching into middle-class and wealthy neighbourhoods, prompting hundreds of spontaneous, if small, protests.Venezuela\u0027s Maduro bids to be new ‘Christ of the poor’ with help from ‘Hand of God’Venezuela\u0027s Maduro bids to be new ‘Christ of the poor’ with help from ‘Hand of God’Argentina\u0027s football legend Diego Maradona takes part in the closing rally of the electoral campaign of Venezuelan acting President Acting Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro greeting his supporters during his campaign closing act in Cabimas, VenezuelaVenezuela\u0027s opposition leader and presidential candidate Henrique Capriles speaks to supporters during a campaign rally in Caracas Supporters of Henrique Capriles RandonskiSupporters of opposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles cheer during a campaign rally in Merida, VenezuelaSupporters of  Venezuelan acting President and presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro wear a moustache during his closing campaign rally in CaracasVenezuela\u0027s acting President Nicolas Maduro holds his grandson as he stands with his family on stageSupporters of Venezuelan opposition candidate for  president, Henrique Capriles Radonski, cheer during his campaign closing act in BarquisimetoA portrait of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is held by a supporter of  Venezuelan acting President and presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro during his closing campaign rally in CaracasVenezuela\u0027s acting President Nicolas Maduro greets supporters holding Cuba\u0027s and Venezula\u0027s flags with during his closing campaign rally in Caracas, VenezuelaVenezuela\u0027s opposition candidate, Henrique Capriles, holds a dove as a sign of peace during a campaign rally in BarquisimetoAn Henrique Capriles\u0027 supporter holds a dove besides a photo of the candidate during a campaign rally in BarquisimetoSupporters hold a toddler wearing a Maduro-style mustache at the closing campaign rally for Venezuela\u0027s acting President Nicolas Maduro Supporters of opposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles cheer for him at his closing campaign rally in BarquisimetoA supporter of Venezuelan opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski attends a campaign rally in CaracasVenezuela\u0027s opposition leader and presidential candidate Henrique Capriles greets supporters during a campaign rally Supporters of Venezuela\u0027s ruling party presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro, one dressed as Fidel Castro and the other as Cuban revolutionary hero Ernesto \u0027Che\u0027 Guevara, stand on a bus before the start of Maduro\u0027s closing campaign rally in Caracas, VenezuelaA sign poking fun of ruling party presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro is seen during an opposition campaign rallyA supporter of Venezuelan opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski shows a poster that reads \u0027my mom wants to be your mother-in-law\u0027The government blames a drought, as well as electricity outages partly attributed to sabotage by opposition activists. But community groups say the cause of the damage is more systematic – a combination of corruption, the flight of specialised workers from the country and the difficulty of buying imported spare parts in a nation were the currency is so worthless that you could wallpaper a building with money notes for less than the cost of paint.In past years, Perez says, water would run frequently enough to fill up the big blue tanks the couple keep in a corner. Now she goes outside, to a gutter where stray dogs defecate, to collect water that she boils and uses for cleaning. For drinking and bathing, her husband carries empty bottles to the home of her sister, who has larger cisterns and has been somewhat more fortunate with service.The road to Caracas – where cargo trucks have become a novel way of travelThe water crisis is one symptom of the failing state around her. Another is the lack of food. Perez’s daughter, a public school teacher, collected back wages last week. The family used the money to buy a rare treat – a dozen eggs. Skyrocketing inflation means they cost 480,000 bolivares – the equivalent of nearly one week of her husband’s salary. Perez, nearly emaciated, has lost 17 pounds in the past year.“I feel hopeless,” she says, adding that she fears the government will ensure a Maduro victory on election day, no matter what voters do. “We want change, but I don’t think we’ll get it.”Inside Caracas University Hospital – one of the capital’s largest – the first thing that hits you is the smell.“We’ve had no water for two weeks, and it just came back today,” says a 29-year-old doctor who guided two journalists through its dim halls. The doctor spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals, since the hospital’s administration is pro-government. “For a while,” she says, “some toilets couldn’t be flushed.” Medical shortages have gripped Venezuelan for several years. But things have markedly worsened over the past few months as water and power have become more intermittent. Three weeks ago, the electricity went out for a whole weekend, with generators able to power only the emergency ward, surgery rooms and the intensive care unit.As Venezuela has rocketed into hyperinflation, drugs and supplies – almost all of them imported – are increasingly unaffordable.Malaria was once rare here. Now the hospital is receiving almost 40 infected patients a day. The worst cases end up in the infectious disease ward, which on the recent visit was loaded with patients suffering from preventable or treatable illnesses that have run amok in a weakened population.Lethargic measles patients filled a room marked “isolation”. There was a round hole in the door from a missing knob, allowing the air inside to easily filter into a hallway. The corridors echoed with the coughs of skeletal HIV patients, some of whom are suffering complications from tuberculosis.A child carries a plastic container on the outskirts of CaracasThere will be fewer and fewer doctors to treat them. “A big part of our newly graduated medical students are leaving the country right away. I’d say 90 percent of them,” says Oscar Noya, a doctor who heads the hospital’s malaria department. On a recent afternoon, Leon Avila, a 54-year-old security guard, was waiting at a bus stop at the bottom of a hill in Guarenas, a slum 18 miles east of Caracas. To reach his home at the top, he would normally travel by public bus.But of the 25 buses that used to ply the route five years ago, all but two are out of commission because of a lack of affordable spare parts. In Venezuela these days, a single tyre can cost 100 times what a bus driver makes in a month. Even the two buses currently running are suffering from breakdowns – so frequent that residents have been forced into a relatively novel type of transit – cargo trucks, whose drivers charge them a fare.Zulay Perez has only had running water once in the past year“Travelling like cargo is now our day-to-day life,” Avila says.In Caracas, 70 per cent of the city’s 18,000 buses are not operating. The rest work only intermittently, says Hugo Ocando, a transportation union leader. Ten to 15 per cent have gone out of order this year alone, he continued. After a midsize cargo truck pulled up to Avila’s bus stop, he piled into the back with a mob of others. “Stop boarding people! We’re getting asphyxiated!”, someone shouted in the back.In moments, more than 30 people were crammed inside, holding on to ropes to keep from falling. Much of the cabin’s interior was dark. There were no windows, with the only light and air funnelling through the open back doors.“It’s like we’re animals,” Avila says. The mainstream opposition is boycotting Sunday’s vote, citing a lack of guarantees of a free and fair election. Maduro’s government has banned some key opposition figures from running, kept others behind bars and prompted at least one to seek asylum at the Chilean Embassy in Caracas. Maduro, 55, will still face two main challengers: Henri Falcon, a former governor, and Javier Bertucci, an evangelical pastor. But despite growing international pressure, including an escalating list of US sanctions, few here believe that Maduro is prepared to lose. The government was widely accused of fraud in an election last year for an all-powerful legislative body. Venezuela blocks opposition candidates from presidential electionVenezuela’s opposition refuses to recognise surprise win for MaduroEvidence of ‘crimes against humanity’ in Venezuela conflict, says UNYet with so many Venezuelans expected to skip the vote, Maduro may genuinely edge out his opponents Sunday. According to the Delphos polling firm, Maduro and Falcon are neck and neck among likely voters, with Maduro at 38 percent compared with Falcon at 37 percent. Bertucci is polling in third, with 20 percent support.Critics say some Venezuelans may vote for Maduro out of fear – of losing state jobs or government-subsidised food baskets. Maduro says they will vote for him out of national pride. “When you ask Donald Trump who’s going to win in Venezuela, even he says, ‘Maduro,’” the Venezuelan leader said at a rally last week. “And why are we going to win? Because we are the fatherland, of history, of dignity.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We can be positive and we can stand together’People in Manchester have gathered at events across the city to mark the first anniversary of the arena bombing that left 22 people dead and hundreds injured.Over a thousand attended a service in bright sunshine outside Manchester Cathedral which began with a minute’s silence that was observed across the country.Elsewhere, people laid bouquets of flowers in St Ann’s Square and others left hand-written notes on Japanese maple trees that have been planted to form a “Trees of Hope” trail through Manchester.Pop star Ariana Grande, who had finished a performance at the arena when the bomb was detonated, shared a message of hope, telling survivors and families of victims she was “thinking of you all today and every day”.“I love you with all of me and am sending you all of the light and warmth I have to offer on this challenging day,” she said in a tweet in which she also included a bee – the civic symbol of Manchester.Members of the public observe a minute’s silence in Cathedral Gardens (PA)Outside the cathedral a choir sang “Amazing Grace” and “Somewhere Over the Rainbow”, and Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Sikh, Muslim and humanist leaders all addressed the congregation. On the altar stood 22 lit candles, made from the wax of thousands of candles left in the city’s St Ann’s Square in the days after the attack. Prince William and Theresa May joined survivors and emergency workers who responded to the attack for the service.William read a passage from the Bible’s book of Corinthians, ending: “Faith, hope and love abide, these three but the greatest of these is love.” ‘You will never be forgotten’, reads a message left among the flowers (Jessica Morgan)A large screen showed photographs and the names of those killed. Many struggled to keep themselves from sobbing, and small groups of people held each other as they cried when specific names and faces came up on the large display.People leaving the service said they thought it was a “perfect” tribute, and that they were “proud of our city”.Mother and daughter Susan and Emma Wardley had both known victim Martyn Hett for over 10 years through the LGBT+ community. They said the attack had become “part of Manchester’s history”.Susan told The Independent: “I feel we have to remember the people that died as a mark of respect. We have to remember those who were injured, who helped and saw some horrific sights. We need never to let it go because it’s part of Manchester’s history. It happened but we can’t change that. We can be positive and we can stand together.”Emma added: “It’s amazing to know we have so much support from other people. But what saddens me so much is that it shouldn’t be because of a tragedy that we’ve come together. It shouldn’t be like that. The world needs to respect and to love each other no matter what.”Manchester Bombing Attack: one year onManchester Bombing Attack: one year onThe Flower Festival at St Ann\u0027s Church marking the Manchester Arena bombing The Trees of Hope trail in St Ann\u0027s Square where people are encouraged to leave and share tributesThe Flower Festival at St Ann\u0027s Church marking the Manchester Arena bombing The Trees of Hope trail in St Ann\u0027s Square where people are encouraged to leave and share tributesThe Trees of Hope trailin St Ann\u0027s Square where people are encouraged to leave and share tributesThe Trees of Hope trailin St Ann\u0027s Square where people are encouraged to leave and share tributesThe Trees of Hope trailin St Ann\u0027s Square where people are encouraged to leave and share tributesEmbracing Manchester Exhibition at St Ann\u0027s Church was created by artist Ghislaine Howard after being inspired by  Muslim video blogger Baktash Noori who, after the attack spent days in the city centre trying to win the trust of the public.

Everyone was so together and you could walk around and everyone hugged each other despite not knowing each other.

It takes fear and tragedy to really bring out what’s important and that’s just sticking together and focusing on the positive.”Salman Abedi, a 22-year-old Briton of Libyan descent, blew himself up as fans were leaving Grande’s concert at Manchester Arena.Many of those killed were children, and others included parents waiting in the lobby as the concert ended.Police have said more than 800 people were left “with physical and deep psychological injuries” as a result of the attack.Agencies contributed to this reportor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We had a celebration for the prince. There were many, many pigs. We had many, many people come who wanted to celebrate.”Strange island: Pacific tribesmen come to study BritainWith the atmosphere further lifted by kava, a drink made from a plant root said to have sedative and mood-enhancing qualities, the celebration seems to have been even more joyous than those for the duke’s 89th birthday on June 10 2010.That was when it had been prophesied that Prince Philip would come to Tanna to be with his people, living in a hut and hunting wild pigs with them.The slight disappointment that the dukeMessiah was a no-show on that occasion was mitigated by the fact that British gap year student Marc Rayner, 18, was on hand to act as a stand-in.As a stickler for protocol, the duke would doubtless have been glad to hear that Mr Rayner adopted formal dress by wearing a nambas, a slightly more extensive version of the penis sheaths that Tanna men wear in everyday life.“They are a wonderful people and I didn’t want them to feel let down,” said Mr Rayner.  “I stepped in to explain that the prince\u0027s many responsibilities prevented him from visiting in person - but that he would one day rest in spirit on the island.”As it is, however, although Tanna is the home of the so-called “cargo cult” known as the Prince Philip Movement, the duke – in bodily, if not spirit form – has never set foot on the island, one of 82 in the Vanuatu archipelago.The closest he came was in 1974, when he visited the Vanuatu capital Port Vila on the royal yacht Britannia with the Queen.Chief Jack Naiva, one of the paddlers of a traditional war canoe which greeted the royal yacht, was quoted as saying: I saw him standing on the deck in his white uniform. I knew then that he was the true messiah.Tanna elders later sent Prince Philip a nal nal hunting club.  He sent them back a picture of himself holding the club.  The photo has become a cherished religious icon on Tanna.In the village of Yaohnanen there is a sort of shrine to the duke, with a Union Flag draped over framed photographs of the Queen’s consort.Last year’s announcement that he would be retiring from public life did nothing to dampen the people of Tanna’s devotion to him.Jimmy Joseph Nakou told reporters from the Associated Press that it was still the custom for villagers in Yaohnanen and Yakel to gather every evening, drink kava, and pray to Prince Philip.“We ask him to increase the production of our crops in the garden, or to give us the sun, or rain,” he said.  “And it happens.“Here in Tanna, we believe that Prince Philip is the son of our god, our ancestral god, who lives up in the mountain.Top gear: William and Kate had an Aston Martin with balloons and a JUST WED number plate.

But the cults reflect quite logical and rational attempts to make sense out of a social order that appears senseless and chaotic.”  He outlined how South Pacific populations with “highly developed cultures” had been subjected to “enormous social stress and strain” by the arrival of Europeans with “cargo” – Pidgin English for trade goods – and frightening technological power.With the 19th Century traders came missionaries, who thought it would be clever to try to make Christian ideas like the Second Coming more palatable by tacking them on to existing South Pacific beliefs.The result, however, seems to have been that instead of Christinaity, beliefs grew up that a local hero or god would come to initiate paradise on Earth and bless the people of the South Pacific with the riches of the white man’s cargo.Worsley explained that the seizure of islanders for work on the plantations of Australia and Fiji left them disinclined to swallow whole the missionaries’s teachings: “The splendid vision of the equality of all Christians began to seem a pious deception in face of the realities of the colour bar, the multiplicity of rival Christian missions and the open irreligion of many Whites.“They found that acceptance of Christianity did not bring the cargo any nearer. They grew disillusioned.”Prince Philip asks \u0027Is that a terrorist?\u0027 after seeing bearded manPrince Philip believed in nuclear disarmament, letters revealPrince Philip \u0027told Blair’s team to f*** off’ over Diana’s funeral96 Prince Philip gaffes in 96 yearsThen the Second World War came to the Pacific.On Vanuatu the appearance of so many troops and so much US military hardware seems to have boosted the “John Frum Movement” that had begun in the 1930s, and was still going strong in 1960 when David Attenborough visited to be told about a Messiah figure: “’E look like you. ‘E got white face. ‘E tall man. ‘E live ‘long South America.”On Tanna, the John Frum Movement seems to have morphed into the Prince Philip Movement some time in the 1950s or 1960s.One theory is that people on Tanna noticed the respect with which British colonial officials spoke of the Queen, and aligned Prince Philip with their traditional belief that the son of the mountain god would travel over the sea, marry a powerful woman and eventually return to his people.  One Tanna elder has suggested that the Prince Philip Movement will not die with him but be passed on to his children, and his children\u0027s children (Getty Images  WPA Pool  Pool)And at the time the duke\u0027s retirement, it was also suggested that the Prince Philip Movement would not die with him.Tanna elder Chief Tom Numake was quoted as saying: “Just because he has retired, it doesn\u0027t just stop.“It will be passed on to his children, and if they have children then it will continue on through them. The followers don\u0027t just see it as Prince Philip but that it will continue going on through the bloodline.Which does now rather suggest that in the unlikely form of Prince Harry, Meghan Markle has just got herself hitched to a husband who might one day, just possibly, come to be seen, as the Messiah, not a very naughty boy. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle weddingor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It can’t be time limited or it’s not a backstop.”Commission officials have pointed to the first page of the draft withdrawal agreement, which includes a note, signed off by both sides, stating that the backstop alignment can be ended only if another solution is found.“The negotiators agree that a legally operative version of the ‘backstop’ solution for the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, in line with paragraph 49 of the joint report, should be agreed as part of the legal text of the withdrawal agreement, to apply unless and until another solution is found,” a note on page 1 of the withdrawal agreement says.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesBrexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

I would be very afraid of the threat to the peace process, it was a dreadful time to live through. Even to go to mass on a Sunday, you’d have to go through checkpoints. It is terribly stressful,’ said Mullen. ‘All those barricades and boundaries were pulled down. I see it as a huge big exercise of trust and I do believe everyone breathed a sigh of relief’A bus stop and red post box stand in the border town of Jonesborough, Co ArmaghA UK government spokesperson said: “The prime minister set out her position yesterday. The fallback solution put forward by the EU is not acceptable, and that’s why we will be bringing forward our own proposal. We want to make progress as soon as possible.”Cabinet ministers including Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have signalled their unease at the backstop plan in recent days. The foreign secretary issued an apparent veiled warning to the PM while speaking to reporters on a trip to Latin America, warning her against “betrayal”.“Brexiteers fearing betrayal over the customs backstop must understand that the prime minister has been very clear that neither option is an outcome we desire – we want a deal with the EU and she will deliver it,” he said.“I’m convinced that the prime minister will be true to her promises of a Brexit deal that sees Britain come out of the customs union and single market, have borders as frictionless as possible, reject European Court of Justice interference, control immigration and free to conduct unhindered free trade deals across the world.”Bank of England Governor Mark Carney: Brexit has already hit UK GDP by up to £40bnSpeaking separately, Mr Gove was at pains to make clear that the backstop was “intended not to be implemented” and was “there just in case”.Brexiteer cabinet ministers have repeatedly rolled over for Downing Street after issuing similar veiled warnings on issues ranging from the Brexit orce bill to the transition period, however.The row over the backstop is the latest twist in the wrangling over what post-Brexit customs arrangement the UK and EU will have.The backstop was agreed on paper in December as part of a deal – the joint report – struck between Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels. The section on the backstop says that “in the absence of agreed solutions” to the Northern Ireland border, “the United Kingdom will maintain full alignment with those rules of the internal market and the customs union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all-island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement”.Why both parties are changing their Brexit strategies this weekIt has since become clear that the UK and EU have begun to interpret the agreement in different ways, however. Downing Street says the entire UK will stay in alignment under the backstop, while Brussels says the agreement was intended only to maintain full alignment in Northern Ireland.The difference in interpretation comes because the UK desperately also wants to prevent customs checks at Irish Sea ports between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The DUP, on whose votes the Conservatives rely for a majority in the House of Commons, are staunchly unionist and have threatened to block any plan that puts any checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Ms May has said “no British prime minister” could agree to such a state of affairs.Brussels is, however, concerned that the UK would gain access to the single market without having to commit to its four freedoms – effectively gaining a preferential deal. Talks between the two sides started again in Brussels on Tuesday with the remaining issues of the withdrawal agreement, Northern Ireland and the future relationship on the agenda. With the focus of negotiations now clearly between Theresa May and her own cabinet, the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier last week said there had been little progress on any issue since the March meeting of the European Council.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Progress has been slow so far, however, with some partners such as Japan saying they would prioritise the EU ahead of Britain, or others such as the United States attaching difficult conditions.Speaking as ministers from the EU member states signed off the start of talks, EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said: “This is great news. We look forward to adding Australia and New Zealand to the EU’s ever-growing circle of close trading partners. “We are already close in terms of shared values and our open, global outlook. Together, we will now negotiate win-win trade deals that create new opportunities for our businesses, as well as safeguard high standards in key areas such as sustainable development. “I am looking forward to visiting Canberra and Wellington in the coming weeks to officially launch our negotiations. Starting these talks between like-minded partners sends a strong signal at a time where many are taking the easy road of protectionism.”We look forward to adding Australia and New Zealand to the EU’s ever-growing circle of close trading partners.In September of last year, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker proposed the start of full trade talks with the two countries. Preliminary discussions between Australia and the EU were already completed in April 2017, following an announcement of intention to start a trade deal by both actors in November 2015. The Australian government says the EU is its largest export services market and also the country’s largest source of foreign investment. Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has meanwhile promised not to “muck around” in doing a deal with the UK, but talks are yet to begin because Britain cannot legally start them until it has left the union.EU minister says little progress has been made on Brexit since MarchLabour MP Gareth Thomas, former trade minister and a supporter of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “Once again, our international trade secretary has been outfoxed in his attempts to secure new post-Brexit free trade deals.“The supposed economic benefits of Brexit rely entirely on striking new international trade deals, but clearly most countries are more interested in negotiating with the EU, the largest trading bloc in the world, than with the UK alone.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Mr Conte also said he had attended the International Kultur Institut in Vienna to refine his legal studies. The Kultur Institut is however a language school and does not offer legal courses, according to its website.The politician, who previously acted as the personal lawyer for Luigi Di Maio, the leader of the Five Star Movement, also claimed that he pursued his legal studies at Yale University, Duquesne University, the Sorbonne in Paris, and the University of Cambridge. Cambridge was unable to immediately confirm or deny whether Mr Conte had attended, citing confidentiality rules.A spokesperson for the Five Star Movement said in a statement that the criticism of the would-be prime minister’s CV showed that the press was “so afraid of this government of change”.“In his curriculum Giuseppe Conte wrote with clarity that he perfected and updated his studies at New York University. But he did not cite courses or say he completed a master’s at the university,” the spokesperson said.“Conte, like any scholar, has studied abroad, enriched his knowledge, and perfected his legal English. For a professor of his level, the opposite would have been strange. He did it and rightly wrote it in the curriculum vitae, but paradoxically this is not good now and it even becomes a fault. It is the umpteenth confirmation that the press are so afraid of this government of change.”World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPeople demonstrate in Paris during a nationwide day protest by French public sector employees and public servants against the overhauls proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron, calling them an attack by the centrist leader against civil services as well as their economic security.Newly appointed Catalan president Quim Torra arrives to visit jailed Catalan separatist politicians at the Estremera jail near Madrid.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro casts his vote during the presidential elections in Caracas.

out at least one massacre of Hindu villagers in Myanmar’s conflict-wracked Rakhine state, an Amnesty International report has concluded. Ethnic conflict has convulsed the military-ruled southeast Asian country in recent years, with the military accused of slaughtering members of the Muslim Rohingya minority in the majority-Buddhist country.But the new report from the human rights organisation suggests that a Rohingya group known as the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) killed up to 99 Hindu women, men and children while also abducting Hindu villagers.‘Bittersweet’ Ramadan for Rohingya

residents by saying they were suppressing an armed insurrection after attacks on police posts.The Rohingya have responded by suggesting that their communities suffered disproportionate and undiscerning government reprisals as a result.But while the Amnesty report accused Myanmar authorities of orchestrating a frenzy of “unlawful killings, rapes, and burning of villages” targeted at the Rohingya, driving a mass exodus to neighbouring Bangladesh, it said “no atrocities can justify the massacre, abductions, and other abuses” committed against Hindu villagers.Rohingya Crisis in Photos

crucial as it is for the crimes against humanity carried out by Myanmar’s security forces in northern Rakhine State”, Ms Hassan said.After ARSA members launched an assault on army installations in August of 2017, the report says, Myanmar’s security forces launched an “unlawful and grossly disproportionate campaign of violence marked by killings, rape and other sexual violence, torture, village burning, forced starvation tactics and other human rights violations”.Security forces targeted all Rohingya in Rakhine state, the report alleges.ARSA responded by unleashing violence on Hindu people, according to Amnesty. It says the group killed some Hindu villages “execution-style” and abducted others, with survivors recounting having been forced to “convert” to Islam if they wished to be spared.The group denied having carried out a massacre.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Nanny-state ROASTED as just elite \u0027controlling lower classes\u0027                 Shameless Corbyn has betrayed the working classes says STEPHEN POLLARD\u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a prize on offer for the parties who understand this.She also predicted that people on low and middle incomes are less likely to associate with Labour now than they used to.She continued: \u0026ldquoWorking class support for Labour has declined, it\u0026rsquos started to rise a bit for the Tories, and has definitely increased among the SNP.Radical changes to the economy and society means the world of work is largely different to what it was 40 years ago, and that disenfranchised Labour voters have floated away.By 2005, working class support for Labour had tailed off, and they had begun to not vote for anyone at all, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation executive.Ms Ainsley said the message for politicians was simple - tell voters what you are going to do, and then show them when you\u0026rsquove done it.She suggests new policies such as an extra bank holiday, a crackdown on soaring shop prices and a massive housebuilding programme could capture working class voters.In her new book, The New Working Class: how to win hearts, minds and votes, Ms Ainsley says: \u0026ldquoNew Labour was right to suppose that Labour could now build a parliamentary majority based on the traditional working class alone, but they were wrong to assume those voters would have nowhere else to go.Outspoken Shadow Home Secretary, Diane Abbott holds strong opinions which does not always go down well.

This must change.\u0026ldquoAs a country, we need to harness and give a greater value to the contribution that people make in their communities in later life, and that requires political leadership and commitment.

These can only be efficiently addressed by the appointment of a Minister for Older People, one with enough influence to unite these departments.\u0026ldquoOlder people\u0026rsquos issues cannot be addressed in isolation because they often impact more than one government department. For example, relaxing restrictions on building retirement properties will result in less demand on the NHS.\u0026ldquoOnly through a dedicated minister can the Government send a clear message that it is serious about addressing the needs of today\u0026rsquos and future generations of older people. We fully back the  calling for a Minister for Older People.In 2012, MPs unanimously urged the Government to consider creating a Minister for Older People.The decision was reached after a cross-party group of backbenchers, who said elderly members of society are often overlooked by politicians, launched a Commons debate on the subject. But there has been no responsibility handed to a cabinet minister.TIM CLARKEBaroness Altmann is a Campaigner for older peopleSo this is how 21st century Britain repays proud old folk, says\u0026nbspBARONESS ALTMANN,\u0026nbspCampaigner for older peopleI commend the  for its excellent campaign to highlight the need for a dedicated minister for older people and hopefully ensure they, to whom we owe a huge debt of gratitude, are treated with the dignity, care and respect they deserve.Latest research on digital discrimination is another shocking indictment of the way so many older people are treated in Britain today.The most worrying aspect is that it is Government itself which is discriminating against older people.People already in their late 70s or 80s, who had no opportunity to learn about technology, cannot be expected to master online transactions at this stage of their lives.Many may be disabled or live alone, which makes such age discrimination particularly heartless.These people built Britain into the success it is today, often served loyally in wartime, then worked hard to rebuild the country in the post-war years. They have sacrificed much for our country.We must not let them down. Housing and council tax benefits can be a lifeline for older people. It seems many are being denied this money just because they cannot cope with filling in online application forms. STOCKBaroness Altmann supports the  campaign for a Minister for the elderly Many will still be alive for another 20 or more years and must be allowed to claim their entitlements for many years into the future. Many elderly people have nobody to help them fill in online forms, or are too proud or embarrassed to ask for help.So they go without. This is unacceptable in 21st-century Britain. I call on the Government to establish a minister with special responsibility for older generations.For far too long the elderly have been considered a viable target to take money from in order to help younger generations.Most young people would not wish to see older citizens deprived of rights or left in poverty and we need a cross-Government approach to ensuring no generations are unfairly penalised. STOCKThose who cannot use online services usually lose out, says Baroness AltmannWhen I was pensions minister, it was proposed I should take on the role of minister for the ageing society, liaising across various departments. The idea was dropped by David Cameron, but I would love to see Theresa May establish this role.Digital discrimination extends well beyond being unable to claim benefits.Those who cannot use online services usually lose out in banking. They are denied the best rates on savings accounts \u0026ndash and in insurance \u0026ndash being unable to shop around for more competitive quotes.We must not let this go unchallenged and having a minister responsible for ensuring older citizens are not marginalised by the advances taking place in technology would be a positive way of ensuring government is aware of the needs of the older generations."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/Brexit-news-Brexit-news-Michael-Gove-Brexit-news-Philip-Hammond-Brexit-news-Brexit-defeat-Brexit-news-House-of-Lords-Brexit-963762.jpg","title":"Brexit news Michael Gove blasts Philip Hammond for Brexit defeat House of Lords","story":"GettyA source from the Treasury stated Mr Gove was \u0027clearly wrong\u0027 to blame Mr HammondThe Environment Secretary declared the Treasury\u0026rsquos opposition to his plans for a new green watchdog resulted in the EU Withdrawal Bill blow.In a letter, Mr Gove wrote: \u0026ldquoAs I explained at Cabinet on Tuesday, the short-sightedness of the Treasury has now led to an entirely predictable and avoidable defeat on the EU Withdrawal Bill and inflicted a damaging blow to the Government\u0026rsquos environmental credentials.The MP for Surrey Heath insisted the Government will need to make \u0026ldquosignificant concessions to overturn the amendment from the unelected Lords.He added it is critical that we now confront the reality of our position and emphasised ministers cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of recent weeks and have the Government\u0027s environmental credibility further undermined.

Well, Harry’s acted.They all talked about modernising the Royal Family. Harry has actually done it with a bride and a wedding service like no other.“Love,” Bishop Curry told us in his extraordinary sermon — which spoke in accents unheard of in polite English churches — “love can change this world.”It’s sure changed the Royal Family. Ms Markle, it is worth repeating, is mixed-race, American, of uncertain religion, an actress, divorced and with a sexual history.In the past any one of these would have rendered her deeply doubtful as a royal bride and the combination would have ruled her out entirely. But the times they are a’changing.The stigma of divorce was still powerful as late as the 1990s, which is why it took so long to dissolve the disastrous marriage of Harry’s parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana.But their divorce, and Charles’s subsequent remarriage to Camilla, acted as a sort of earthquake which brought all the remaining conventions of royal marriages — virginal brides, nice English girls, no divorce — tumbling down.Which, in a nutshell, is how the Royal Family came to get Meghan.But why did Meghan want to become royal? The short answer is that she wanted Harry. But so did lots of other women, who all baulked at the prospect of becoming royal.Not Meghan. Indeed, she seems to have embraced it as passionately as Harry himself.As an actress, of course she wasn’t fazed by the publicity that had so put off Harry’s earlier girlfriends. But there’s more to it than that.At university she took a double major in theatre and international studies — which was her real love.She became an intern in the American embassy in Argentina. She took the exam to enter the US State Department, which is the equivalent of our Foreign Office.It was only when she failed the notoriously difficult test that she turned to acting.Moreover, the moment she enjoyed success and fame with Suits, she used it to leverage her entry on to the international stage as “Global Ambassador” for World Vision Canada, among many other good causes.In other words, acting was not her vocation. It was only a means to an end.And that end is much better served by her marrying Harry, becoming royal and using her fame — and his — to serve the issues, particularly women’s issues, she is so keen on.So you could say that Harry — the eternal boy-man — is marrying his mother, since Diana used her fame too.But Diana did it in opposition to her estranged husband. Meghan aims to do it in partnership with Harry and at the very heart of the Royal Family.And she’s proving astonishingly adept — is it those actressy skills again? — at winning over the British establishment.Back in the 1930s, the Archbishop of Canterbury was the deadly foe of Wallis Simpson, King Edward VIII’s divorced American bride, and led to his abdication.Today, Archbishop Justin Welby is Meghan’s best friend. Indeed, he’s practically three in a bed with the couple.There’s chemistry, of course. But there’s also calculation on both sides.Welby wants to use Meghan, who as an American does religion as well as touchy-feely, to spearhead a religious revival among the young.The Royal Family also want to buy into her as an international brand.Which is why the Queen appointed Harry Commonwealth Youth Ambassador.Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKKeeping the Commonwealth going in the face of the overwhelming indifference of British politicians of all parties has been the greatest personal achievement of the Queen’s long reign.And she capped it by ruthlessly stage-managing Charles’s acclamation as her successor as Head of the Commonwealth at the most recent Commonwealth Conference.That was the constitutional bit sorted out.Harry’s appointment addresses the equally important question of PR.Meghan and Harry are the model modern couple: Mature (well, she is), bi-racial,bi-cultural, international, do-gooding, fashion-conscious and media-savvy to their fingertips.They are the perfect face of a modern monarchy at home and ideal Global Ambassadors for Brand Windsor abroad.And, come to think of it — which I’m sure the Queen and her advisers have done — they are the perfect Global Ambassadors for post-Brexit Brand Britain as well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It showed this country is world class.The sub-plot, of course, was the emotional union between the damaged children of two broken families.Fans have long yearned for Prince Harry to find happiness after the roller-coaster life and shocking death of his fabled mother, Princess Diana.They have warmed to a young man who transformed himself from a mixed-up kid to a likeable soldier, helicopter pilot and champion of war-damaged Invictus casualties.As for his bride, Meghan Markle is the glamorous star of hit TV series Suits, who dreamed as a child of becoming a princess.Best of all in this age of right-on political correctness, she is the daughter of a charming African-American mother and an Emmy-winning Hollywood lighting specialist.The House of Windsor is now truly multicultural.It is also hip.Our amazing sovereign, at 92, and doughty Prince Philip, 96, both heading for their royal telegrams, are the Queen and King of Cool.Where else in the world would you see an Elton John double act with Windy City preacher Bishop Michael Curry?This was a truly uplifting occasion, worn lightly by a once-stuffy Royal Family.Nobody does it better when it comes to choreographing mounted cavalry, trumpets, banners and horse-drawn carriages with an electric-powered E-Type and a vintage Rolls-Royce.All underscored by a sense of humour, as Harry and his supportive brother William exchanged banter at the altar of Windsor’s historic St George’s Chapel.Even the weather turned out in tribute, bathing Windsor Great Park’s glorious greenery in spring sunshine.There may have been some muffled coughs over Markle family squabbles but they were nothing compared with the torrid dramas leading to the Queen’s own “annus horribilis”.The world has become used to British pageantry.But this Royal Wedding was a timely reminder that Britain is not just a small island with a fading history on the edge of Europe.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex ride in a carriage down The Long Walk back towards Windsor Castle after getting married in St Georges Chapel, WindsorThe 21st-century United Kingdom is an unrivalled brand on the global stage.The world was witnessing more than mere pomp and circumstance.This was UK plc on international parade, joining hands with the global community in a way no other nation can match — even the mighty USA.Had Meghan married into the family of a French or American president, a German Chancellor or a Kremlin tsar, would anyone have tuned in?Neither China nor Russia could captivate so many friendly eyeballs.The Olympics might do it.But London 2012 revealed Britain is best on these occasions, too.On Saturday, Britain proved it is capable of reaching out to a world beyond borders.Harry and Meghan’s marriage bonded the UK indelibly with the US.If the new Duke and Duchess have kids, they will be American citizens — as well as British due to Harry’s lineage — and will eventually be liable to American tax.Importantly, this wedding had special significance for the 2.5billion citizens of 52 Commonwealth countries, especially in Africa and the Caribbean, who swear allegiance to the Queen.My Australian in-laws were constantly on the phone from Sydney this weekend, all thoughts of becoming a republic abandoned, to discuss the finer points of royal protocol.But this event was watched from lands with no current ties to Britain — South America, the Far East and the Gulf States.It was a showcase of modern Britain forever adapting to change, the key to our success as an outward-looking nation.There was a clear hint of defiance, too. This steely couple were doing it their way.Our Brexit negotiators — on both sides of the argument — should take note.That big wide world, viewing us in high definition on Saturday, is where Britain’s future lies.These are our markets.The audience liked what they saw and they want some of what we’re having.In marketing terms alone, it was priceless.Too often we underestimate our strength and standing.We have developed an absurd inferiority complex.We’ve been led to believe we are too weak and puny to stand alone on the global stage.Yet we are among the world’s greatest economies, second only to Germany in the EU.We are a nuclear power with a real professional army which has helped keep the peace in Europe, and have an envied place on the UN Security Council.Republican lefties despise all this stuff.They smear Britain’s record as a brutal colonial power while ignoring our global lead in abolishing slavery.Disturbingly, some Conservatives seem to agree the UK is washed up and past its prime.Since we cannot run our own economy, they say, we should hand the job to unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.These, remember, would be the same Brussels flunkies who created the euro, wrecked the economies of member states and put millions of unemployed young people on the scrap heap.Most of those workless youngsters gratefully upped sticks and moved here.I wonder why?Saturday’s Royal Wedding showed we are in the Premier League.Now the world is watching, perhaps with slightly less enthusiasm, as another British saga lurches towards its climax — another broken family consumed with jealousy and bent on revenge.The cast is familiar — the statutory drunk, a bully who prefers to talk with a gun in his hand, some characters who would prefer a car crash to a happy ending.Can we stop the bickering and reach a good Brexit deal?Why can’t the Leavers and Remainers put the country first, join hands, bury their differences and take a vow to work together to serve the national interest?Inspired by the Royal Wedding, by the poem Invictus, we can rise above petty differences.“We are the masters of our fate: We are the captains of our soul.”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Oh well.Most married couples leave it 18 months before they reach that arrangement.But on that bombshell it was on with the Royal Wedding, which normally divides the nation into two distinct camps.There are the royalists, who have great fun watching all the pomp and pageantry on television.And the republicans, who have great fun hating all the pomp and pageantry on television.So the only real choice to be made, for all of us, is: Which channel?Personally, six hours of a photobombing Kay Burley giving it the full Partridge on Sky News was a punishment that’s way beyond me, as was five hours of the E! channel gang ­yelling: “Oh my God. Wow!”ITV was never going to be anything less than thoroughly professional in the hands of Julie Etchingham and Phillip Schofield, once he shut up about Holly Willoughby, so I went with the Beeb, where Naga called it a night shortly after announcing Prince Harry was now: “The Duke of Essex.”Oi! Oi! “Sussex rather.” Oh. Pity.The real surprise for some of you, though, might have been discovering that to give it an informal vibe, ­alongside Kirsty Young, BBC1’s 9am-and-beyond coverage was now being fronted by the strangely contorted ­figure of Dermot O’Leary — the former host of ITV’s The Marriage Ref.A show that may have been the ­perfect rehearsal for most royal ­weddings, but probably not this one.They weren’t alone, obviously.The Beeb had the joint surrounded, in fact, by among others Huw Edwards, ­fashion expert Jo Elvin, who was “across the dress” (as clueless as the rest of us), Alex Jones, Ore Oduba and Anita Rani, who performed the ­essential task of repeating what the other person had just said.Ore: “First glimpse of the dress, it’s going to be a moment.”Anita: “It’s going to be a moment.” Traditionally, of course, on these great state occasions, the moment TV crews start interviewing other TV crews is the cue for the coverage to descend into flannel, repetition, idle speculation, cliche (“Excitement’s ­building”), imponderable questions and outright stupidity.On Saturday, by slight contrast, the trigger was actually the arrival of Oprah Winfrey and the first trickle of celebrity guests, who had a clearly ­nervous ­Dermot asking: “When the invite says ‘hats’, does that mean hats are an absolute given?”“Absolutely, it does,” said Kirsty, slapping him down testily.It got progressively worse with each arrival as well.So by the time Amal Clooney wafted in alongside husband George, who was dressed as one of Modern Romance, even basic motor tasks seemed beyond some of the BBC team.Kirsty: “It can be difficult to wear a hat, can’t it?”Jo: “I think so, yes.”In fairness, it should also be stated this idiocy was certainly not restricted to the BBC.I switched over to ITV during the ­arrivals and heard Meghan’s old drama teacher, Gigi Perreau, say: “This is incredible and we’re right there. Well, we’re here but we’re also there, so it’s fabulous.”It’s just the nature of the beast.With so much time to fill, everyone will say these things.Only the BBC, though, could possibly leave me feeling queasy with the choice of one of its Royal Wedding experts.This was left-wing “social commentator” Afua Hirsch, who was privately educated and has led a life of unimaginable advantage, compared to most of us, but is also a professional victim who thinks pretty much ­everything is “racist”, wants Nelson’s Column torn down and wasn’t about to drop her agenda with such a large audience at her mercy.“While I have felt alienated by the inherited privilege,” said Afua, who’s enjoyed more than most, “my own struggles with identity have made me appreciate the need for cultural ­continuity.“So while I didn’t relate to the Royal Family, I did relate to that need for a sense of tradition.”Quite a brass neck, isn’t it, speaking out against the whole concept of the Royal Family, while simultaneously using them to increase your TV profile, as Afua had been doing all week.Instead of telling her so, or pointing out Harry’s ex Chelsy Davy had arrived while she was guffing away, a nodding Dermot said he could listen to Afua “all day”.A claim I doubt, frankly.Indeed, I reckon he’d have been throwing himself off Windsor Castle’s ramparts before breakfast if he’d tried.No one else, I suspect though, was listening to a single word she said.Nor will they have needed Afua’s lofty approval to enjoy a day filled with so many memorable events, including Bishop Michael Curry’s fiery address to the congregation, the ­reappearance of the Duke of Edinburgh and Meghan’s Rolls-Royce ­hurtling up the Long Walk past 100,000 Union Flags like it was being driven by Richard Hammond.These are all magical moments you’ll possibly want to watch again — and if you do, having sat through both start to finish, I’d probably recommend the ITV version.It had the better ­historic detail, was never in any danger of missing Chelsy Davy’s arrival and rounded everything off nicely as well.Over on the BBC, meanwhile, Kirsty did it by searching for profundities and going where angels feared to tread.“Something has travelled between Harry and Meghan that might be the next page of the story, where they give us a gorgeous little product of their union which we might enjoy too . . . ?”Though not if Naga’s honeymoon arrangements are to be believed, they won’t.Obviously.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

May that never change.The immense global interest in the wedding was a reminder, too, of our standing on the world stage.Around the planet, an estimated two billion viewers of all colours and creeds watched, transfixed by our history, culture and traditions.How many other countries could pull in such ratings?It was a stark reminder that Britain is an outward-looking, adaptable and unique nation. Brexit negotiators should remember this.An exciting new era awaits the happy couple, and us, as a truly global Great Britain.SHADOW Chancellor John McDonnell is a sinister politician who would wreck Britain’s finances.Yesterday he outlined how he wants to overthrow capitalism and introduce socialism.He and Jeremy Corbyn would take us down a very dark path. Just look at once-rich Venezuela, where socialism resulted in the poor starving to death and there being no medicine for the sick.Madly, McDonnell yesterday claimed the South American country’s problem was that it was not socialist enough. He also said he wanted a “zero- tolerance” approach to anti-Semitism, yet defended Labour’s appointment of Martha Osamor to the House of Lords.That’s the same Martha Osamor who claimed the party’s anti-Semitism row was manufactured as “a tool to intimidate activists on the Left”.We wouldn’t expect anything less from McDonnell, a man who glorified the IRA, described London rioters as “the best of our movement” and joked about lynching a Tory minister.There are rumours the Government is insanely considering calling a snap election — risking handing this scary clown the keys to the country finances.The Tories would not just be gambling their future, but Britain’s.CULTURE Secretary Matt Hancock is right to get tough with the social media giants.For far too long Facebook and Google have shown no concern for the youngsters using their sites.Mr Hancock invited 14 of the internet giants to a consultation.

Later, I went back with him after he had built a night school for the boys, and asked over a cup of tea: “Why are you doing this, Harry?”He replied: “This is the most important thing I do.”It tells you everything about who his mother was.Inside the Chapel, the hymn was Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, which was played at Princess Diana’s funeral and one of her favourites.Di’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes delivered the only reading. Listening to it was Sarah, the Duchess of York, who had not been invited to other recent royal weddings.Inviting Fergie was a brilliant thing to do. During Diana’s troubled times every Sunday she would drive down to Berkshire to have lunch with Fergie, spending the afternoon talking about their divorces.Outside in the Chapel courtyard were 2,000 people from Harry and Meghan’s charities, including servicemen who have lost limbs.Harry is following Diana’s hugely successful campaign to stop landmines by working with those who have been wounded by IEDs.When Harry was flying back from one of his tours of Afghanistan he shared the plane with three soldiers who were in a coma.He realised these soldiers, if they recovered, would have limbs missing and facing a life of misery — which is why he inspired them with his support for the Invictus Games.And Harry and Meghan asked guests to make donations to the Children’s HIV Association.Harry has clearly never forgotten how his mother took the stigma out of Aids by embracing sufferers, including babies in Brazil.And then there was the ring. On Saturday night Meghan was wearing the emerald-cut aquamarine ring Diana first wore in 1996.Harry once told ITV’s Tom Bradby: “I wanted to do something that would make my mother proud.” He succeeded on Saturday.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I am distraught at the outcome and I am very sorry it did not come out the way I meant it.”The tragedy occurred on March 16, 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee.She told the tribunal: “The plan was for the baby to be delivered by a Caesarian section.I thought with a C-section we might not have a live baby and it would have been a difficult procedure.Dr Laxman urged the mother to attempt a natural birth rather than having a C-section“I still believe we had a very good chance of having the baby using other options than a C-section but we had to act fast.The bottom of the baby came out quite easily and when this happened I thought it was going to be possible.“I started to encourage the patient to push. Whilst she was pushing I applied some traction to the baby’s feet so I could deliver the baby. She was doing well.“After that there was some difficulty in delivering the arms.The arms were then delivered and I went to deliver the baby’s head, I was trying to flex the baby’s head but I didn’t feel the baby move and the cervix started to close. I tried to deliver a couple of times and asked for help.”Laxman said she to tried to cut the cervix but the incision had no impact.She added: “We made another cut to the cervix and I used my index finger to flex the baby’s head.But, at some point between the general anaesthetic and the decapitation, the baby died - I’m not sure when.”I was told the neck was tearing and that’s when I knew the baby had died.The hearing continues."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000405543210.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jeremy corbyn is alienating both sides of brexit debate and should start backing second referendum tony blair says","story":"The ex-PM claimed the current Labour boss is a closet Eurosceptic who is refusing to take a strong stance on Brexit.And ultra-Europhile Mr Blair said Mr Corbyn should throw his weight behind a second EU referendum.He claimed Labour’s vow to leave the single market but stay in the customs union would create “the worst of both worlds”.Mr Blair added: “If the reason for being against the single market is we don’t want to be merely rule takers, then the customs union solution has the same objections.”He said Labour’s support for a customs union is an “unacceptable compromise” for Leave voters.But at the same time pro-EU voters were also “losing faith in Labour as a route to avoid Brexit”, Mr Blair insisted.Speaking on BBC Radio 4s Today programme this morning, he said: That ambiguity probably did serve Labour well at the last election... I dont think it works any more today.Were in a position now of not pleasing the Remainers or the Leavers.Mr Blair concluded: I think the sensible thing for the Labour party to do is to say, if we want a jobs-first Brexit the sensible thing to do is to stay close to Europes economic area.If people then say, Whats the point of leaving?, you say the final decision should be taken by the British people on whether to proceed on this basis.In the same interview, the former PM insisted he had no idea that a Libyan dissident had been sent from Britain to his home country when he was in power.Mr Blair said he acknowledged Theresa Mays decision to make a formal apology to Abdul Hakim Belhaj and his wife Fatima Boudchar.He added: I have gone along with what the Governments done, which is issue the apology, I didnt actually know myself about this case until after I left office.The couple were sent to a prison run by the forces of Libyan dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/lg5_0676-1.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"a and e live davina mccall","story":"No two days are the same, she says. We deal with everything from minor issues right up to terrible injuries - and it changes from hour to hour.Suicide attempts, car accidents, head injuries, strokes, bashes and broken bones  - all of them are in a day’s work for Chanele and her colleagues.It’s a dramatic, fast-moving world, and one which television cameras will aim to capture as it unfolds when ITV broadcasts live from their A\u0026ampE department.A\u0026ampE Live marks 70 years of the NHS, and the show, fronted by Davina McCall, will be taking place over the next three nights.And the production crew, just like the doctors and nurses, will have no idea what will burst through the doors of the hospital and into one of the UKs leading trauma centres.There will certainly be no shortage of patients - each day the department deals with an average of 350-400 people, and while there are occasional quiet periods in the middle of the night, it’s normally a hectic 24-hour operation.Patients could include the walking wounded, those stretchered in by an ambulance dash or even someone brought in by the helicopter for emergencies where every second counts.Things have got a lot busier in the sixteen years I’ve worked here, says Chanele.  Even within the last twelve months, you can see attendances are increasing.An ageing population, more complex problems and changing expectations have all contributed to the rise in numbers.Then there’s the frequent flyers – those who attend A\u0026ampE regularly - and a convenience culture which means patients often arrive at A\u0026ampE when they would be better off seeing their GP.The latter has become so prevalent that it has led Leeds General Infirmary to pilot a scheme in which a GP is in attendance in their A\u0026ampE 12 hours a day, seven days a week to relieve the pressure on their harried staff.As a major trauma centre the department has also seen the impact of rising knife crime.We see stabbing injuries quite regularly, says Chanele. It can be all ages – we have had middle-aged victims although most are younger – and the outcomes are varied.Some people can get stabbed in the arm and survive, but someone can get stabbed in the chest and not make it.Inside the department abuse is also a daily reality: most A\u0026ampE staff see being sworn at as part of a day’s work although thankfully physical violence, though it happens, is less common due to the presence of security staff.However, some frustrated patients take out their anger on walls and chairs, which can be stressful for staff and other patients.Lets hope the show it isnt too gory, as Davina previously exclusively revealed to The Sun that her fear of blood could pose some problems.“I have to brace myself, she said. I’m very squeamish - I think I’m going to need to see a hypnotist beforehand because I’m not very good with blood.That would be terrible if the presenter faints live on air, wouldn’t it?”Then there’s the families.Some of our patients are going through the most horrific day of their lives - but that also means a huge trauma for their family too, Chanele explains.Many of them are in shock  - they have someone they love in the resuscitation area and they don’t always know what is happening.We try to include them as much as we can – we have to think not only of the patient but their carer as well.Poignantly, the ultimate fate of their patients usually remains unknown.Once they leave the department, whether it is to go home or to care elsewhere in the hospital, most A\u0026ampE staff never get to hear about what happened next.The reality is that we can only deal with what is right in front of us though, Chanele explains.Because as we’ve seen, there’s little in the way of breathing space – not that Chanele would have it any other way.I couldn’t think of doing anything else,’ she says.

The neighbours had mentioned a bunker but I hadn’t thought anymore about it.“I was talking to the builder about it while we were having a cup of tea in the garden and he said, ‘Come on let’s have a look’.”The first cavity, which had a metal ladder about 8ft to 10ft in length attached, was full of water so they spent two days pumping it out.At the bottom of the ladder was a wooden door which was open and led to the two rooms.The first measures four metres by three metres and the second is five metres by three metres.At the end of that room, the pair found another door. Tony dug out the rubble behind the door and discovered another ladder.Chris added: “It’s an emergency escape ladder in case the first one was destroyed or blocked by rubble from a bomb.“It’s not worth fully digging it out as it’s a small area.”Chris said neighbours had mentioned the possibility of a bunker in the back garden.He said: “I’ll be asking them more about it. We were really shocked by the size of it.“There are a lot of electrics and switches down there and lights on the wall.

Over a million premises already have direct access to them, but if we are to achieve our ambition of a truly high-speed economy, and keep up with our competitors, then we need a step change in our approach.”The targets will be met by freeing up businesses to deliver the internet revolution rather than a huge injection of new government money, Mr Hammond said.In a tongue lashing to flagging British businesses, he also called on them to step up and do a far better job of embracing new technology and practices.Many of the UK’s companies are failing to learn from their competitors and keep up with productivity improvements, the Chancellor argued.“We need business leaders in this room and around the country to embrace innovation and technological change and to invest in driving productivity growth.”Labour attacked The Tory Treasury chief for presiding over productivity growth hitting its lowest level in 200 years.A Labour spokesman said: “Sadly this announcement only offers a drop in the ocean compared to the amounts of money really needed to take our country forward”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So is Her Majesty the Queen. They haven’t felt the need to label themselves as such we know from their actions.As the basic scriptwriting rule dictates, show don’t tell.To her credit, Meghan Markle championed many charitable causes that advocate female empowerment before she met Prince Harry, and no one is suggesting she shouldn’t continue with this work.But what grates about the above statement is the unsaid inference that here is a feisty, independent woman who, unshackled by pomp, ceremony and dutiful political impartiality, is going to drag the stuffy, deluded old monarchy kicking and screaming into the 21st century.That this go-get-’em gal from the US of A is going to shake things up with a few bumper-sticker sentiments and teach those Brits a thing or two about how the world works.Or perhaps we should leave it to Patrick Jephson, former private secretary to Princess Diana, a man very much in the know on the inner workings of the House of Windsor.In his book, The Meghan Factor, he says: “The one key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising force. It’s a useful guideline when weighing the pros and cons of any intended course of action, from saving a local playgroup, to saving an endangered species, to saving the planet. What always comes first is saving the monarchy.”Quite. In other words, don’t get up the collective nose of the British public or they might just, ahem, pick it and flick you off into oblivion.As we saw on Saturday, as Bishop Michael Curry’s address entered what felt like its third decade, The Queen’s resolutely impassive expression suggests she’d make a fine poker player.We have no idea what she thought of it, nor Donald Trump, Brexit or the highly political Me Too campaign. She has opinions, of course. But what she doesn’t do is wear them like a badge.Just like her great-great-grandmother Victoria, who advocated “never complain, never explain”, The Queen knows the future of the monarchy lies in being a non-political figurehead who promotes national unity.Jephson adds: “If you acquire a profile, a purpose and a passionate public devotion independent of the royal mainstream, then you risk being perceived and presented as a threat to the Crown itself.”We already know what Meghan thinks about an awful lot of things, because her life so far can’t be edited.We also know that her soapbox has just got bigger thanks to her new status which, to those unused to it, could foster the corrosive misconception that everyone is hanging off your every word.Read my pursed lips: They’re not. They’re just being polite.So Meghan must learn fast that she’s a very minor cog in an ancient royal machine that has survived so long by saying nothing and doing its duty to its loyal subjects.Frustrating that may be for a “feminist” (or, indeed a manist), but that’s the trade-off for the largely taxpayer-funded life of luxury that is granted, not self-generated.As a celebrity, you can say what you like and we can choose to listen or not. But opinions divide people and, as a royal, you are supposed to represent everyone.Meghan needs to understand, and implement, that distinction sooner rather than later.HUMAN rights lawyer Amal Clooney was officially crowned “best-dressed guest” by fashionistas observing the Royal Wedding.According to one, she was “a sublime vision in marigold”, though personally speaking, Colman’s Mustard yellow might be more accurate.Either way, Ms Clooney once again proved adept at pulling focus from the other mere mortals floundering in her ever-stylish slipstream.By contrast, the Duchess of Cambridge’s understated, Alexander McQueen frock coat got a sniffier reception from certain fashion quarters, not least because she’s worn it three times before.They’re missing the point.A wedding is about the bride, not the guests.And Kate understood that perfectly by wearing something that wouldn’t propel her into the limelight on Meghan’s big day.Now that’s style.THOSE attending Chelsea Flower Show (no, me neither) have declared that “she-sheds” are the latest must-have – kitted out with radiators, chandeliers and squishy sofas.Alternatively, we could have all that inside the house and just send the other half out into the garden.AN Islamic school in Birmingham has warned female pupils against using tampons.The guidance, adopted as school policy, states: “Among the types of pads, tampons may not be appropriate due to insertion.”But the head of the school insists it has “no connection to faith”.Hmmmm. Meanwhile, it has emerged that women are having “virginity restoring” operations on the NHS at a cost of £1,000 a time.The 30-minute procedure involves the hymen – which can break after using tampons, doing sport or having sex for the first time – being stitched or reconstructed.One relationship counsellor suggested that one of the reasons was that some religious women were “over- whelmed” by feelings of sexual guilt and wanted to be “as pure as possible again” for their husband.Want to? Or are forced to by religiously driven, moral expectations not placed on the man they’re marrying?Either way, is this really something the NHS should be funding when money for other, more vital, operations is so scarce?MEMO to Sir Anthony Hopkins: Yes, families do fall out and just because you’re related doesn’t mean you have to like each other.But saying you “don’t care one way or the other” whether your 48-year-old daughter Abigail has children or not seems overly cold and perhaps partly explains your 20-year estrangement.In future, a simple, “We don’t speak and I’d rather not go in to it”, might be wiser.HOW come, in this age of state-of-the-art camera phones, when anyone spots the Loch Ness monster, beast of Bodmin Moor or any of the other fearsome creatures supposedly roaming our shores, the evidential photo is always out of focus?Exhibit A: The “lion” spotted in Oldbury in the West Midlands this week.Yep.

He had definitely had a procedure done – he wasn’t feeling very well. He seemed like he was in a bit of pain. Heart surgery obviously isn’t something minor.“He definitely wanted to lay low. He was given his space and he did not come out of the guesthouse.It was an apartment with a full kitchen so he could cook. He didn’t have any visitors – it was a bit sad that he was all by himself.“He checked out on Monday and said he was feeling better and well rested. It is good to see him back on his feet again.”He emerged from the guesthouse, in a gated compound three miles south of Antonio Del Mar, on Monday afternoon, after telling the landlady that his daughter looked “beautiful” at the wedding.Despite recovering from heart surgery, Thomas Sr was picked up by a pal, single mum Lori Davis, 38, and driven to a Starbucks, where he was seen holding a creamy Frappuccino with whipped crème.The Emmy Award-winning lighting expert was then taken back to his scruffy cliff-top home – carrying a bag marked ‘personal belongings’. It was one week since he had been seen at the property – following the heart drama which eventually saw him ruled out of attending the royal wedding on health grounds.He had told TMZ on Monday last week that he suffered a heart attack six days previous and was not going to go to the royal wedding. Twenty-four hours later he informed the website that he had checked into hospital.The father-of-three underwent surgery on Wednesday – later revealing that three stents had been inserted into his blood vessels. He then told TMZ that he had crossed over the border, 45 minutes from his Mexican home, and was recovering in California, where he watched Meghan get hitched from the bedroom of a ‘safe house’.Thomas Sr, who watched as Prince Charles gave Meghan, 36, away, told the website it was “emotional a joyful”, adding: “My baby looks beautiful and she looks very happy. I wish I were there and I wish them all my love and all happiness.“The service was beautiful and its history. I will always regret not being able to be there and not being able to hold my daughters hand. My baby girl is a duchess and I love her so much.“When you watch your child get married, every thought goes through your mind, every memory from the first day she was born, the first time I held her.”The Sun told on Monday how Meghan and Harry – who had spoken to Thomas Sr during an emotional phone call on Thursday – were discussing plans to visit him.They are thought to be leaving on their honeymoon this week, following Saturday’s glitzy wedding at Windsor Castle – attended by David Beckham, Oprah, Tom Hardy and George Clooney.

So the inescapable conclusion is that Mr Livingstone has jumped before he was pushed. After left-wing activist Marc Wadsworth was expelled for bringing the party intro disrepute for comments towards the Labour MP Ruth Smeeth a few weeks ago, the disciplinary panel would probably had found against \"Red Ken\" too.Critics of Mr Corbyn claimed earlier this year that he had hounded out Labour\u0027s former general secretary Iain McNicol, awarded a peerage on the eve of the Royal Wedding last week, and that his replacement, former Unite official Jennie Formby, was a stooge.As a result, his one-year suspension was extended by another year.It was then that the Labour MP John Mann confronted the former London mayor in front of reporters in Westminster, accusing him of being a \"Nazi apologist\".Mr Mann, who chairs parliament\u0027s All-Party Parliamentary Group Against Antisemitism, chased Mr Livingstone up the stairs at the Westminster offices of Sky News, shouting and calling him a \"f****** disgrace\", which resulted in extraordinary TV pictures showing the clash.This year, the anti-Semitism row in the Labour Party has become more damaging.An unprecedented demonstration by Jewish organisations, supported by dozens of Labour MPs, filled Parliament Square and there was evidence that the row robbed Labour of taking control of Barnet Council in the elections on 3 May.After the Parliament Square demonstration, the leaders of the same organisations held a meeting with Mr Corbyn in Westminster, but immediately dismissed the talks as a missed opportunity.The first demand of these Jewish groups - and the so-called \"moderate\" Labour MPs who joined them in Parliament Square in March - was the expulsion of Mr Livingstone from the party.Some of Mr Livingstone\u0027s strongest critics are disappointed that he was not put through the formal disciplinary procedure and expelled, claiming that would have made his return to the party impossible, while resignation leaves the door slightly ajar.In his resignation statement, Mr Livingstone said he recognised he had caused offence and upset in the Jewish community. \"I am truly sorry for that,\" he said.But he said he does not accept the allegation that he has brought the Labour Party into disrepute, nor guilty of anti-Semitism. That suggests he is unrepentant and remains defiant. Mr Livingstone has, of course, quit the Labour Party before, when he stood as candidate for London mayor as an independent after he was denied the Labour nomination by a plot by Tony Blair to install Frank Dobson instead."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-north-korea-south_4298127.jpg?20180501145528 ","title":"north korea path to peace is paved with photo ops","story":"And we\u0027re wondering: How much importance should we attach to the closing of the Punggye-ri test site?

He simply doesn\u0027t need to do any more tests, so shutting down Punngye-ri doesn\u0027t mean all that much.Those points are good ones, although you can deal with them one by one. In reverse order: The last test might have been impressive but the North\u0027s nuclear programme is far from complete - not least in demonstrating the ability to fit a warhead to a missile that successfully reaches its targets.That would require further testing. At the moment, neither the West nor Kim himself really knows whether North Korea could do this reliably and accurately. But the chance isn\u0027t worth taking.The decommissioning of Punggye-ri is therefore total symbolism. That\u0027s why camera crews are here, not weapons inspectors. But that symbolism is hugely important.Kim has pledged no more tests - an easily verifiable claim. If he reneges on that, he makes a very public, deliberate choice - the opposite of hiding a weapons program in secret.More importantly, the path to peace is paved with photo ops. The rapid turnaround in the situation on the Korean peninsula has been captured in three moments full of imagery and symbolism.The North Korean delegation to the Winter Olympics the meeting of Kim Jong Un and Moon Jae-in in the demilitarised zone between their two countries, still technically at war the handover of three American political prisoners to the US, shown off by a deliriously happy Donald Trump at Joint Base Andrews in Washington. All photo opportunities.But photo ops that have pushed things closer to peace, stunts that have built momentum when the difficulty of complex geopolitical negotiations have slowed it."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-harry-meghan-duke-duchess_4317509.jpg?20180522163913 ","title":"pictured meghan and harry at first official royal outing","story":"It is Harry and Meghan\u0027s first royal duty as husband and wife after they were married in a ceremony at St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle on Saturday.Harry began his speech at the palace by remembering those \"affected by the tragic events at the Manchester Arena a year ago\".The first anniversary of the deadly bombing was marked by a memorial service earlier on Tuesday at Manchester Cathedral.:: Why the new Duchess of Sussex cannot be Princess Meghan Harry also paid a moving tribute to his father for his charitable work over more than four decades.

It reveals how Environment Secretary Michael Gove blamed the Chancellor Philip Hammond for a defeat in the House of Lords over environmental protections.  Peers voted to force the Government to maintain EU environmental principles and standards after Brexit , the 15th defeat suffered during the Bill\u0027s passage through the Lords last week.  And Gove says the Treasury\u0027s refusal to back giving a new UK environmental regular teeth was an act of short-sightedness which led to the avoidable Lords defeat for the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill.  In the letter to Cabinet colleagues, which was obtained by the Daily , Mr Gove pinned the blame for the defeat on the Chancellor\u0027s department.  The newspaper reported Mr Hammond blocked plans to give a new post-Brexit environmental watchdog the power to impose fines on the Government and local authorities if they fail to meet targets on boosting recycling and cutting pollution.  In the letter Mr Gove wrote: The short-sightedness of the Treasury has now led to an entirely predictable and avoidable defeat on the EU Withdrawal Bill and inflicted a damaging blow to the Government\u0027s environmental credentials.  The Government will face a battle to reverse the 15 defeats suffered in the Lords when the legislation returns to the Commons within the next few weeks.

The National Fund was set up with an anonymous \u0026pound500,000 gift in 1928 - but one major catch means that it has so far been untouchable. The terms of the bequest stipulated that it should be only used to pay off the entire national debt. Despite growing 800-fold in value since the original \u0026pound500,000 donation, the fund has never been sufficient to clear all of the nation’s debt.  It has therefore remained locked in the specially created National Fund. The Fund has since grown to \u0026pound400million, but is dwarfed by the debt - which in December was estimated at \u0026pound1.7trillion. It has never been worth more than 0.066% of the national debt. Attorney General Jeremy Wright filed documents at the High Court, urging judges to alter the terms of the trust fund and release the money for its intended use.  Mr Wright said: “Almost 90 years ago, an anonymous donor bequeathed money to the nation and yet we have not been able to put it to good use. “We have been working with the Treasury, trustees and the Charity Commission to find a solution consistent with the donor’s original objectives of extinguishing the national debt. “I am applying to the High Court to ask that the fund is released - and if that application is successful, the fund could be used to benefit the nation by helping to do what the original donors intended.” Barclays, which manages the charitable fund, has been trying for years to get permission to use the money to make charitable grants or to turn it over to the Treasury. But any change has to be approved by a court.

Lord Tyrie, who lost his seat in 2017, is a former chairman of the Treasury select committee. But despite serving as a Tory MP for a decade, he will not be taking the Conservative whip when he joins the House of Lords. This will be a particular blow to the Prime Minister who has recently suffered 15 defeats on Brexit in the Lords. Theresa May triggered fury when she announced a fresh batch of Conservative cronies for the Upper Chamber under cover of the Royal Wedding.  In theory she created nine new Tory peers, three new Labour Lords and gave the DUP one. But with Tyries admission that reduces the Tories\u0027 haul to eight. The Electoral Reform Society estimates the extra Lords and Ladies could add another \u0026pound1,079,000 per year to the total bill, with peers able to trouser \u0026pound305 a day just for turning up. Lord Tyrie, who has been appointed head of Britain\u0027s competition watchdog, faced accusations of impartiality if he took up his seat on the Tory benches. Cabinet Office spokesman Lord Young of Cookham said today that Lord Tyrie will sit in the Lords as a non-affiliated peer. Lord Young was responding to concerns raised by Lord Newby, Liberal Democrat leader in the Lords, at question time. Lord Newby asked if ministers agreed with the Institute for Government that Andrew Tyrie cannot be an independent chair of the Competition and Markets Authority and take the Government whip, but should sit as an independent crossbencher instead.  Lord Young said Mr Tyrie was a robustly independent-minded chairman of the Treasury select committee in the last Parliament and regularly held the Government to account. I have spoken to Lord Tyrie this morning and can confirm he will be sitting as a non-affiliated peer ... and not be in receipt of the Conservative whip. Mr Tyrie is among nine new Conservative peers announced last week along with one Democratic Unionist and three Labour.  Tory Lord Garel-Jones said Jeremy Corbyn had given an undertaking that if elected leader of the Labour party he would not nominate any new peers and asked what might have led him to change his mind.  Lord Young said Mr Corbyn had recognised that the Lords has a role to play in holding the Government to account and had, when campaigning to be leader, said he could see no case for appointing new Labour peers. I\u0027m delighted that sensible heads on the Opposition benches have persuaded him to change his mind and help refresh the Labour benches, he said.

The stunning snap shows the Queen and the next FOUR in line to the throne: Princes Charles, William, George and the three-year-old Princess Charlotte. Prince Louis, just one month old, was absent from the days events.  James Brookes, director of communications at Royal Central , said the photo, one of three released by Kensington Palace, will be seen as turning point for the monarchy in 50 years time.   Speaking to MirrorOnline he said: 70 years ago the monarchy almost collapsed because a king wanted to marry an American divorcee. He was shunned forever for it. Now we have a beautiful official photo featuring not just an American divorcee but an American divorcee who is mixed race, something else which is rare with the royal family. It is hard overstate just how important this photo could prove to be. It points to the fact it was a modern wedding, something both Harry and Meghan wanted to have. They wanted to put their own stamp on the wedding and they did but they are both still aware of the tradition Harry\u0027s family is steeped in. They\u0027re not shying away from that but they are showing the royal family is open to change.   The pictures, taken by fashion photographer Alexi Lubomirski , are significantly different from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s wedding photos from 2011 - which are more formal.  James says that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, ages 33 and 36 respectively, are likely to have more freedom to break with tradition than Harry\u0027s older brother who is second in line to the throne. The shape of the royal family is going to change dramatically over the next 10 to 15 years. The Queen and Prince Philip will no longer be with us, Charles will be king and Prince William will take over as Prince of Wales.  William and Kate know what\u0027s coming so they are sometimes a little bit more reserved. They want to make sure they can take on the baton. Harry and Meghan have less pressure on them because it is unlikely they will be on the throne. But they will still hold a lot of power on how the royal family moves with the time. You could tell from the ceremony, which was magnificent, they want to bring about change. And this photo shows that, it shows that they are open to change, however slowly it may be.

When Frankie was born, he weighed about the same as a cup of coffee and at first his chances of survival were slim.  Parents Michelle and Pete Thompson were shocked when her labour started early and their baby was born 16 weeks prematurely at St Peter\u0027s Hospital in Chertsey.  Immediately after birth, the 378g (13oz) baby boy was placed into a sandwich bag and resuscitated successfully. His mum and dad were told the first two days would be critical and they had to tell his eight-year-old step-sister he might not make it.  Doctors and nurses then faced a gruelling battle to ensure Frankie did not suffer from any of the birth defects that affect premature babies. Now, held in the arms of his doting mother in their Farnborough family home, Frankie is a happy healthy baby with a clean bill of health and against all the odds, a normal life ahead of him.  In fact, leading child experts say that he may even be Britain\u0027s lightest ever surviving baby boy, Get Surrey reports.  The chances of survival for a 400g baby boy is around 25% and surviving without moderate to severe brain damage is astonishingly low, at around 7%. Dr David Evans, The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health Vice President for Training and Assessment said: Smaller baby girls have survived in Britain, but I am unaware of such a tiny boy surviving. Michelle, 36, is incredibly grateful to doctors and nurses at both St Peters and Frimley Park hospitals in Chertsey and Camberley respectively, for saving her son\u0027s life. She said: From the minute I was told to go into Frimley Park they were amazing. It was a massive shock to find out I was going into labour but they dealt with me straight away.  Hospital staff were able to delay Frankie\u0027s birth by almost three days in total by using various different methods. Michelle was then transferred to St Peter\u0027s to give birth. She continued: Again, it was amazing care. They had already gone through what would happen if he does come. After the birth we were told that the first two days were very critical and he was so small so we thought there wasn\u0027t much chance. We then had to think about telling his eight-year-old step-sister, Tilly, who was taken out of school and told that he might not make it. Six weeks later, Frankie was moved back to Frimley Park and things started to look more optimistic. Michelle phoned everyday and remembers holding her breath as the hospital staff answered. Born on September 25, 92 days later, on Boxing Day, Frankie was eventually allowed to go home with breathing assistance.  Michelle, who works as a flight attendant for British Airways said: The neonatal nurses come out on a regular basis check his oxygen and work out when they can next turn it down. Unfortunately he did get bronchitis after a month and went back in but again it was amazing care, everyone was on top of things. He literally stopped breathing as I arrived at the hospital and they were there within seconds. Because he was so premature we have kind of VIP access to children\u0027s ward and if we didn\u0027t have that service things might not have turned out so well. Luckily because Farnborough is a small area all my friends and family are just around the corner and I couldn\u0027t have coped without them all. The kids in the street have been amazing too especially for Tilly. It\u0027s lovely for her and it is lovely for us. There is a nice community spirit and everyone is so pleased for him. Michelle recently returned to St Peter\u0027s to visit the doctors and nurses who saved her son\u0027s life.

The happy couple - who are postponing their honeymoon so they can fulfil official engagements - are at a Buckingham Palace garden party this afternoon being held to celebrate Prince Charles turning 70 later this year. But there is something familiar about the Prince of Wales\u0027 outfit - he appears to be wearing the exact same suit he wore for the nuptials on Saturday. The tailored grey suit which comes with a matching waistcoat seems to have been recycled for today\u0027s occasion, a mere few days after he last donned it.  And with the wedding being possibly the most photographed event of the year, he hasn\u0027t quite got away with it. While at Windsor\u0027s wedding he teamed the ensemble with a lilac tie, today he has gone for a blue one.  His suit also looks remarkably familiar to one he wore back in 2016 , at the society wedding between Alexandra Knatchbull, 35, the great-granddaughter of Lord Mountbatten, and Thomas Hooper.  There was speculation at the time Charles had given Alexandra away because of her own father Lord Bradbourne\u0027s ill health. Prince Charles wouldn\u0027t be the first royal to recycle an outfit. The Duchess of Cambridge was initially accused by some fans of trying to upstage Meghan on her wedding day by wearing a cream Alexander McQueen dress with a nude pair of Jimmy Choo heels and a Philip Treacy hat. Wearing white or cream to a wedding is largely seen as a faux pas.   But actually, Kate had made every effort not to upstage the bride at St George\u0027s Chapel as it was the fourth time she\u0027d worn the coat.  For many of her looks over the years, she has wore the dress or coat once or twice before. Today, Prince Charles appears to have followed in the footsteps of his daughter-in-law and got his wedding outfit back on again.

Experts shook in disbelief as they recognised the nine-inch dish as a Jun Number One Narcissus bowl, made in the 14th century for China’s Imperial Palace during the reign of the first Ming emperor Hongwu. It will now return to China after a private collector flew in for the sale. The sellers plan to use their windfall to help their children buy a house.  The family had previously had the bowl valued 27 years ago but its estimated price then was far lower than what it has fetched now, as the Asian art market continues to boom. The bowl had been owned by 20th-century Liverpool-born collector George Eumorfopoulos, whose collection was so vast he added a two-storey extension to put it all in.

And now, for the Duchess of Sussex, the serious work begins.  She and Prince Harry were already back on royal duties yesterday at a Buckingham Palace garden party celebrating Prince Charles’ 70th birthday .  But she has made it clear that her role in “the Firm” will be to do more than wear stylish dresses or just be arm candy for her husband.  Shortly after the wedding, her official biography on the Buckingham Palace website was out and in it she boldly announced she is “proud to be a woman and a feminist”. It was a signal she will be using her huge platform to support causes that help the advancement of women. Insiders say she has the blessing of the palace to do so.  It didn’t take long for the haters to pile in at the mention of the word feminist and I must admit that I initially groaned at the thought.  Of course I believe in equality of men and women which, by definition, makes me a feminist. But I’ve always felt excluded from feminism and feminist debates because they’re always dominated by one voice – well-off middle-class women. Instead of being inclusive, it is exclusive and rarely addresses the views and needs of ethnic minority or working-class women. It seems those who benefit most are usually already well paid and well connected. I’ve been to networking events about gender equality in business or the media and I can usually count the number of non-white women on one hand. During panel discussions I never hear anyone talking about tackling the lack of social or racial diversity. Instead it’s a certain group of women fighting for women like themselves. Women of colour have fought against sexism and racism, but their voice is rarely heard. I believe Meghan can change that. Yes she’s well-off and privileged, but her background, and the fact she was raised by a black woman, gives her a different perspective.  As her bio says, she’s had a keen awareness of social issues from an early age, instilled by her wonderful mother Doria Ragland . “Those early experiences helped shape her lifelong commitment to causes such as social justice and women’s empowerment,” it says.

The city held the Manchester Together - With One Voice concert, which was packed with moments of raw emotion from a city still grieving. But as this video shows, a crowd of strangers joining hands and dancing in a circle to Ariana Grande\u0027s One Last Time, captured the spirit of the event perfectly.  As the song blasted out in Cathedral Gardens, with the lyrics displayed on a giant screen, people spontaneously joined hands, formed a circle and began to dance, the Manchester Evening News reported .   It was an unforgettable moment, bringing to mind the police officer, PC Paul Taylor, who held hands and danced with fans during the original One Love concert. Thousands of people turned out for this evening\u0027s mass singalong as a united act of remembrance for the 22 killed a year ago today.  The event was particularly poignant as the Manchester Survivors Choir, a group made up of people who were at the Arena on the night of the atrocity, and Parrs Wood High School\u0027s Harmony Group, both made a special appearance. Songs were specially chosen to evoke pride and solidarity, including the Ariana Grande hit and One Day Like This by Elbow.

The 6ft 2in beast had been tipped to become the ultimate guard dog to deter burglars. But instead he turned into a real-life Scooby Doo who is even afraid of his neighbour’s pugs. Fed-up owner Mary-Ann Riley struggles to walk Dez because he is scared of cars and lampposts. She said he jumps into her arms at the slightest noise such as rustling bags or the dishwasher.  Mary-Ann, 46, spent two years trying to ‘toughen up’ her petrified pooch before seeking professional help. She booked Dez into behaviour therapy classes in the hope it would give him some confidence. But after more than 200 sessions, costing an eye-watering \u0026pound1,500, he is still a big softy. Mary-Ann, from Alfreton, Derbys, said: “When we first got Dez he was petrified of everything – he was the real-life Scooby Doo.  “He used to be scared of anything covered in faux fur, he’d flinch when I’d open a tin and cower in fear whenever we walked past a lamp post. “I knew that I had to do something to help him get over his fears, or he’d be too scared to live his life. “I found a dog training course that would help him get over his worries, and we’ve been twice a week for over two years. “But despite that, he is still scared by lawn mowers, tractors, motorbikes and the neighbour’s four pugs.”  Mary-Ann adopted Dez as a rescue puppy and he initially appeared boisterous around other dogs. But the housewife said: “As soon as he got home his true side showed. “He would run away when the dishwasher was on and tiptoe around any lamppost he walked past. “He was scared of practically everything in our house. “I knew something has to be done – such a big dog couldn’t be scared of such little things.

Video showing a victim pleading for help from the 23rd floor and shots of the high-rise fully ablaze proved too much for many in the room. Around 20 people walked out and at least one woman had to be treated by paramedics after collapsing in the area outside the hearing room. Bernard Richmond QC had promised at the start of both days of the inquiry there would be a warning ahead of any disturbing footage.  But he forgot, saying changes in the schedule made him misplace notes to remind him. Apologising after a break, Mr Richmond said: “This has been a very busy day. We’ve had a number of technical difficulties to sort out. I said at the start there would be distressing images. I have a system to make sure there are warnings. “Sadly, because of things being moved around, my notes got moved. I should have mentioned again there were images in this room. And for that I’m truly sorry.”  The footage was in a film played as part of tributes to the Choucair family, who lost six members and three generations in last June’s blaze. In heartbreaking testimony, the hearing was told how Zaynab Choucair, three, died alongside sisters Fatima, 11, and Mierna, 13, and mother Nadia, father Bassem and grandmother Sirria.  Nadia and Bassem lived on floor 22, with Sirria next door. Nadia’s sister Sawson and brother Hasim described the horror of losing half of their family in one night. Hasim said he ran to the building with his children after getting a phone call about the fire. He said: “I found the building completely engulfed in flames. We had to stand there for hours, helpless, watching them all burn to death.  “It was five months before we were able to bury them. We took them to a village [in Lebanon] where my family are from. “It was my mother’s wish to be buried next to my father.” Hasim added that he feels part of him has been taken away and described getting flashbacks whenever he looked at the tower. “This inferno has split up families and smashed up their lives,” he said.

The new Duke and Duchess of Sussex are attending a garden party at Buckingham Palace to celebrate Harry\u0027s dad\u0027s 70th birthday year.   It\u0027s the couple\u0027s first official public appearance since they tied the knot at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor, on Saturday.  And Meghan appears to be making quite an impression on her new in-laws, having a giggle with them this afternoon. Endearing pictures show the 36-year-old former actress in fits of laughter with them, at one point even holding her hand to cover her mouth.  Much of the laughter centred around her new husband fluffing his lines while delivering a moving speech to his dad after a hovering bee put him off. Meghan looked radiant in her dress by luxury British label Goat, a brand the Duchess of Cambridge often wears. The blush \u0026pound590 “Flavia” dress in dusky pink is described on the Goat website as having a “contrast silk-chiffon decolletage and sleeves with delicate frayed edge trim on the neckline and cuffs”. The party is being held to celebrate Prince Charles\u0027 charity patronages and military affiliations ahead of his 70th birthday this year. Present at the event are several emergency services personnel who were first responders after the Manchester suicide bombing exactly a year ago which killed 22 people. More than 6,000 representatives from the police, fire and ambulance, mountain rescue and RNLI have been invited.

They were both stunning and sophisticated as they said their vows and married their prince, but there were key differences in their behaviour, appearance and their wedding day as a whole.  As second in line to the throne, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s wedding was very formal, held at Westminster Abbey in April 2011.   Harry and Meghan\u0027s celebration was a lot more relaxed, and the couple have far more freedom to make their special day their own.   But how did Kate and Meghan compare as royal brides? We\u0027ve taken a look at some of the key differences between the two women\u0027s weddings.  The music they walked down the aisle to Kate decided to walk down the aisle to Sir Charles Parry\u0027s I Was Glad from Psalm 222, which was composed for the crowning of William\u0027s great-great-great grandfather Edward VII.  Kate had a VERY long walk down Westminster Abbey\u0027s VERY long aisle. Meghan on the on hand, went for a less traditional song. She had Welsh soprano Elin Manahan Thomas singing Handel’s Eternal Source of Light Divine for her big moment, and it really was beautiful. The cost of their dresses In the lead up to the wedding there were rumours Meghan had opted for a dress which was much cheaper than Kate\u0027s. However as soon as she stepped out the car in a gorgeous pure white Givenchy number is was clear that probably wasn\u0027t the case.  Kate\u0027s detailed lace gown, designed by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, is believed to cost \u0026pound250,000. Meghan\u0027s dress, designed by Brit Clare Waight Keller, has an estimated price tag of \u0026pound387,000. However it is understood that she paid for her dress herself.  Holding hands Much like most of their public appearances since announcing their engagement, Harry and Meghan couldn\u0027t keep their hands off each other during the ceremony.  Kate and Wills on the other hand looked a lot more formal, and didn\u0027t hold hands as much during their service. Who walked them down the aisle Following with tradition, Kate\u0027s dad Michael walked her down the aisle. Meghan\u0027s dad Thomas was due to do the same, but he dropped out for medical reasons after having heart surgery. This meant she was left with nobody to walk her down the aisle just days before the big moment.  In the end she decided to walk the first part on her own, which many have said is a nod to her strong feminist beliefs. She asked her future father-in-law Prince Charles to accompany for the final part stretch. Their age Kate and Meghan are the same age but they walked up the aisle seven years apart. Compared to their mother-in-law Princess Diana, who was just 20 when she married Prince Charles, neither was a particularly young bride.  Kate met William at university, and apart from a brief split they dated for their entire adult lives. She was 29 on her wedding day. Meghan on the other hand had a whole life, including a successful career and a failed marriage, before she finally met her prince. She was 36 when she said her vows.  Speaking at the wedding reception Like most brides, Kate didn\u0027t stand up and speak at her wedding reception and left it to her father, her new husband and his best man. But Meghan was different, and decided she wanted to say a few words to her friends and her family.  It\u0027s understood the bride thanked the royal family for welcoming her into their lives.  According to the Sun , her speech was very romantic and in it she said: I have found my prince.  Their official wedding photos Meghan\u0027s wedding photos are much less formal than her sister-in-law\u0027s. She\u0027s actually sitting on the floor in one of them, with her beautiful dress flowing out in front of her. Kate and William\u0027s photos look at lot more like traditional wedding photos, taken in Buckingham Palace, with more standing and  Maid of honour Kate had her sister Pippa with her on her big day, and she walked down the aisle with her. Of course, Pippa received quite a lot of attention Meghan on the other hand decided not to have any grown-up bridesmaids or a maid of honour at all.

Prince William joined families of the victims of the Manchester Arena terror attack who were remembered at an emotional national commemoration service to mark its first anniversary. There were tears in many eyes as the city observed a minute\u0027s silence to commemorate those who were killed. The order of service listed the 22 names of those who lost their lives with the heading In our hearts forever. The Duke of Cambridge attended a service at Manchester Cathedral alongside Prime Minister Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. The prince was greeted with cheers as he arrived at the service where he met dignitaries and religious leaders outside the cathedral. Hundreds of floral tributes have been laid in the city to mark the first anniversary of the horror. Many were adorned with the image of a bee that became a symbol of defiance in the face of the tragedy.  The Dean of Manchester, Rogers Govender, opened the service of remembrance, saying: In this service we come together as people of different faiths and none, as we remember with love before God those whose lives were lost, and those whose lives have been changed forever and have to live with the terrible memories of that day 12 months ago. There is a land of the living and a land of the dead, and the bridge between them is love: the only survival, the only meaning. Schoolchildren George Herbert and Remsha Asif read a poem entitled For Lost Friends - and the Halle Youth Choir then sang a rendition of Somewhere Over The Rainbow.  The Duke of Cambridge read a Bible passage from the book of Corinthians. He said: For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then we will see face to face. Now I know only in part then I will know fully, even as I have been fully known. And now faith, hope, and love abide, these three and the greatest of these is love.  Thousands of messages of support on cardboard tags have also been attached by members of the public to 28 Japanese maple trees which form the Trees of Hope trail from St Ann\u0027s Square to Victoria rail and tram station. Among the notes were messages which read: Thinking of you all, stay strong xxx, Manchester we stand together. Forever in our hearts, and: As a clever bishop said \u0027there is power in love\u0027. Another message read: RIP to all you beautiful angels who have all gained their wings in such a horrific vile way. Manchester will not cower away to you monsters. Spread love. Stacie xx  More than 7,000 handmade stitched hearts are also dotted around the city centre with people encouraged to smile on the day and take them as they pass as part of social media campaign #aheart4mcr. The massacre on May 22 last year claimed 22 innocent lives when suicide bomber Salman Abedi detonated a homemade device in the lobby of the Manchester Arena following an Ariana Grande concert. Hundreds more were injured or left with devastating psychological trauma. Prince William met some of the bereaved families in private after the cathedral ceremony.  The bombing - the worst terror attack on UK soil since the July 2005 London underground bombings - left more than 800 injured. Ariana Grande released an emotional message of support ahead of the anniversary. She wrote: Thinking of you all today and every day. I love you with all of me and am sending you all of the light and warmth I have to offer on this challenging day. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said it was a day to come together, tweeting: Today ... we remember each of the 22 people whose lives were taken \u0026amp we re-commit to supporting their families \u0026amp all affected.  Members of the public could watch proceedings at the invite-only cathedral ceremony on a big screen in nearby Cathedral Gardens, while the service was also screened at York Minster, Liverpool politan Cathedral and Glasgow Cathedral. Later on Tuesday, more than 3,000 singers from local choirs will join forces and share the spirit of solidarity at the Manchester Together - With One Voice event in the city\u0027s Albert Square from 7.30pm to 9pm.

Moments earlier thousands had defiantly sung Oasis track Don\u0027t Look Back in Anger in a huge show of solidarity. The city\u0027s Albert Square was packed with people as a concert, called Manchester Together - With One Voice, was held on the anniversary of the atrocity. Oasis frontman Noel Gallagher appeared on a big screen to introduce the track, which became an anthem of defiance after the attack at the Manchester Arena last year. Those gathered in the square also sang One Last Time by Ariana Grande, who was performing on the night the bombing happened. The star herself posted a tweet voicing her regret that she was not there in person, but said she loves Manchester.    At 10.31pm, bells rang out from buildings across the city centre to mark the moment when the attack happened 12 months ago. It was followed by loud applause in the square. On an emotional night, messages were also screened from Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany and Manchester United hero Ryan Giggs.  A choir made from police, fire and ambulance officers performed a moving version of Bridge Over Troubled Water at the concert this evening, the Manchester Evening News reports.  And members of the Manchester Survivors Choir, comprised of people who were in the music venue when the bomb went off, also took to the stage to loud cheers. Before they sang Rise Up by Andra Day, choir member Cath Hill told the audience: We are showing Manchester and the world that we carry on.  It is so important for us to be together. We are here to look after each other, care for each other and to be positive and move forward. Poet Tony Walsh returned to Albert Square where last May he read his poem This Is The Place at the public vigil to widespread acclaim. After an earlier minute\u0027s silence, Walsh encouraged the crowd to make a minute\u0027s noise for the 22, those injured in the blast, for the first responders, NHS staff involved in the care of those affected and for Manchester and its spirit and its amazing people. As the crowd of up to 15,000 people responded, Walsh shouted: This is what love sounds like. You can\u0027t stop the sound of love. A mass 30-minute communal singalong finale brought the event to a crescendo with performances of Don\u0027t Look Back In Anger by Oasis, One Day Like This by Elbow, Grande\u0027s One Last Time, Never Forget by Take That and finally The Beatles\u0027 All You Need Is Love. Earlier today Prince William, Prime Minister Theresa May and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn attended a service of remembrance at Manchester Cathedral to pay their respects to the victims.  Former football star Giggs said: Manchester is a city of music and is a city of love, and we are sending out love and prayers on this emotional day. Mani from The Stone Roses said: One voice Manchester. Sing it up. While Liam Fray, of The Courteeners, said: We are a proud city of love and I will be thinking of each and every one of you on this very emotional and very difficult day.

Throughout the city yesterday thousands observed a minute’s silence in a mood of reflection and remembrance. But the mood changed to one of celebration as more than 3,000 singers took to the stage to belt out their defiance and prove that love, hope and music can beat fear and hatred. It was a fitting tribute to the music fans killed at the end of Ariana Grande’s concert at the Manchester Arena, and to a city that refused to be bowed by terror.  One of the choirs that took part in the Manchester Together concert was made up purely of children and their parents who survived the bomb. Some broke down in tears as they sang Rise Up – but with their friends’ arms around them, and the support of the thousands packed into the city’s Albert Square, they were able to stay strong.  The last half hour was dedicated to the people of Manchester, those who pulled together in the darkest hours after the attack to offer help and support. Tony Walsh, whose poem This Is The Place united the city the day after the attack, urged the crowd to make a minute’s noise in memory of the 22, those injured, the emergency services and all those affected.  He said: “This is what love sounds like. Hate won’t win.” In one voice, the crowd joined in the city’s anthems – Don’t Look Back in Anger by Oasis, One Day Like This by Elbow, Take That’s Never Forget, and One Last Time by Ariana Grande – the last song she performed before terror struck.  Corrie’s Jennie McAlpine hosted the event, with video messages from her co-stars, the city’s football heroes, and other leading lights of TV and music. Poet Lemn Sissay summed up the mood as he said: “Let there be peace so the storms can go out to sea and be angry.”  Earlier Adam Lawler, 16, who broke both legs in the attack in which his friend Olivia Campbell-Hardy was killed, said: “If I could go back in time, I’d change everything. But I can’t, so I’m going to try and live my best life. We won’t be beaten because we’re Manchester.”  At a memorial service at Manchester Cathedral yesterday afternoon, Prince William read 1 Corinthians: “Love is patient, love is kind” – an echo of the message of the weekend’s royal wedding.  Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn joined survivors and grieving families there. Hundreds more came to watch on the big screen in the Cathedral Gardens, just wanting to be there together. With 22 candles behind him, Dean of Manchester Rogers Govender said: “We remember with love those whose lives were lost, and those whose lives have been changed forever and have to live with the terrible memories of that day.  “There is a land of the living and a land of the dead, and the bridge between them is love, the only survival, the only meaning.” The service included addresses from Rabbi Warren Elf, Imam Irfan Chishti and Sukhbir Singh of the Sikh community, and humanist Dr Kevin Malone.  At 2.30pm the service paused for the national minute’s silence. In a statement earlier, the Prime Minister said the attack was “designed to strike at the heart of our values and our way of life, in one of our most vibrant cities, with the aim of breaking our resolve and dividing us. It failed.” She was right. A year ago, the mood was one of grief and bewilderment. Today it was one of respect, love and pride.  There were teenagers in Ariana Grande T-shirts, parents in Manchester bee T-shirts, friends laying flowers, all wanting to hug, support and remember. In St Ann’s Square, the focal point for remembrance in the days after the blast, thousands took part in the “trail of hope” between it and the arena.  They wrote messages of remembrance on specially designed cards and hanged them from 28 trees on the trail. One read: “Mum we all love you. What a sad day. Rest in peace our mum.” The hexagonal cards represent the honeycomb created by the worker bee – the symbol of Manchester’s industrial heritage, and of the city’s solidarity.

The exact dates of Ramadan change every year, because Islam uses a lunar calendar and because lunar months are shorter than the solar months used elsewhere. For Muslims who are fasting, this means when Ramadan falls during the summer months, Iftar (breaking of the fast) falls much later in the day - which in turn Muslims observing Ramadan will also pray five times a day. This, together with the physical and mental demands of fasting, mean employers need to be aware of how they can help their staff who are observing the holy month. Speaking to MirrorOnline Jonathan Carr, partner at Lewis Silkin , reveals your rights when fasting and praying at work during Ramadan.    1. Are employees allowed to take time away from work to pray? Not allowing employees a reasonable opportunity to pray during the working day is likely to amount to unlawful discrimination.  All workers are entitled to a break of at least 20 minutes anyway if their working day exceeds 6 hours. Employers should be flexible if the employee wants to take their break at a particular time in order to pray. If the employee wants to take additional prayer breaks, a common solution is to ask them to make up the time but if additional breaks are tolerated for smokers or others without needing to make up time, not exercising that discretion similarly for religious observance could land the employer on the wrong side of the law.  In some circumstances the employer may be able to push back, for instance where the proposed frequency or timing of the prayer breaks would cause significant operational disruption on a production line. 2. Can employees ask employers for space to pray in the workplace or is this up to the employee? Employers are not obliged to provide rooms for prayer but where a quiet space is available and allowing this to be used for prayer does not cause problems for others, the employer should agree.  Refusing such a request could amount to unlawful discrimination, particularly where an existing space is unused and could easily be designated for this purpose. Where the request would involve significant cost or inconvenience to others (for instance converting a bathroom or kitchen facility) the employer will obviously need to weigh up the competing considerations more carefully. If a space can be designated for quiet prayer it is important this is made available to employees of all religions though. Reserving the facility for one faith is likely to result in claims as much as unreasonably refusing a request in the first place.  3. Because fasting for long, warm days during Ramadan can impact on work, do workers have the right to request to work from home or start the day earlier? Yes, as with prayer opportunities and facilities, the key is for employers to offer some reasonable flexibility. If temporary changes to working hours or arrangements won’t cause significant problems then the employer should consider allowing them. It may also benefit the employer if this helps the employee to stay fresh and productive.

Whitney Martin, 18, believed she simply had a cold when she became bed-ridden with flu-like symptoms three weeks ago. Her condition, however, worsened and on May 4 she was rushed to Princess Royal Hospital in Telford, Shrops, after her illness began attacking her vital organs. Just 24 hours later, she was placed in intensive care at a Manchester hospital after suffering heart failure and \u0027technically dying twice\u0027 on the operating table.  Whitney has since been left in an induced coma, relying on two life support machines and has been diagnosed with sepsis and myocardiopathy - a disorder of the heart muscle. Her mum Suzanne, 38, has been forced to quit her job as a support worker in order to care for her daughter who is receiving around-the-clock hospital care. The mother-of-two, who is now living in a bungalow for transplant patients on the hospital site to be close to her daughter, said: It all started about three weeks ago when she had a cold. It was usual flu-like conditions such as tiredness and being hot and cold and we thought she was just being a bit of a drama queen.  She was a fit and healthy girl and we never expected what was to come next as she was such an outgoing girl. On the Friday, her blood pressure was too low and her temperature was sky high and I took one look at her and knew I had to get her to a hospital. She had been due to start a job as a waitress at one of our local pubs the next day. Within 24 hours her condition completely deteriorated and they wanted to transfer her to Birmingham by air ambulance for specialist care because they thought she was going to die. The didn\u0027t have any beds so she went by land ambulance to Manchester. She went straight into intensive care as she suffered heart failure. Her heart stopped twice, she technically died twice on the operating table and she only had a 50/50 chance of survival.   Whitney was placed in a BiVAD machine, an implantable pump designed to help the heart function better when both sides of the organ are failing.   She was also hooked up to an ECMO machine, which uses an artificial lung to oxygenate the blood outside the body.   Although her condition is life-threatening, her family remain hopeful she can pull through after she started showing signs of recovery this week.     Suzanne, who lives with partner Kevin Davidson, 42, a lorry driver, and her son Luis, 20, added: It has just been a living hell and every mother\u0027s worst nightmare.    But she is now off one of the machines after her heart started working independently of the BiVAD machine, which the consultant had said is a small miracle.    We are just hoping for the best now, she has picked up but I could still potentially be here another six, nine or 12 months until after Christmas they are telling me.    The doctors and nurses have just been amazing and I cannot thank them enough for what they have done for Whitney so far.   We are just praying she carries on fighting because we\u0027ve always said Whitney cannot live without me and I can\u0027t live without Whitney - she is my little mini me.    Her grandmother Wendy Burford, said: As a family we\u0027re living day-by-day as everything is now down to chance.    It has been such a shock to everyone as Whitney was so young and full of life.    We are remaining hopeful that Whitney will pull through and wake up soon.    Of course, we want to do as much as we can to help family members who want to visit and support Whitney and make regular visits.    Her mother, Susan, has been so strong throughout it all.   She\u0027s had to give up her job in order to care for and visit Whitney in hospital. Manchester is quite a way and affording to travel on a regular basis is tiring and very expensive.

The snazzy E-type, which has been converted to an electric vehicle, used to belong to Jamiroquai musician Toby Grafftey-Smith, who died last year the age of 46 after a six-year battle with cancer. His widow, Gabriella Crewe-Read, told the Daily Mail: The royal wedding car was bought from Toby. His brilliance is everywhere. She added that her late husband is \u0027still here\u0027. Like Jamiroquai frontman and petrolhead Jay Kay, Grafftey-Smith was a classic car enthusiast and owned the 50-year-old Jag. Jay Kay himself has starred on Top Gear and is famous for his selection of luxury cars.    After his death it was sold by his widow, although Crewe-Read has not revealed who bought it - although the keys have now found their way into royal hands. The keyboard player was an alumnus of Marlborough College, the \u0026pound36,525-per-year boarding school where the Duchess of Cambridge was educated. The car was prepared for the much-anticipated wedding by giving it a new registration plate - the date on which Harry and Meghan tied the knot.  The car is a zero-emissions, battery-electric-powered version of the 1968 car with LED head lamps. Built between 1961 and 1975, the E-Type was described by Enzo Ferrari as ‘the most beautiful car in the world’. This model is said to be worth \u0026pound350,000.

Actor Jay Aubrey Jones only recently became aware that he was the origin of the second-long clip. Now, the 64-year-old has finally put the argument to bed and spilled the beans on what he REALLY said. The voice artist has confirmed that he said the word ‘laurel’ - dealing a blow to those convinced the sound was ‘yanny.’  Oddly enough I had not recognised my own voice when I heard it on television, he told NBC in an interview . I\u0027m completely and utterly floored by this, I\u0027m really amused...every so often I\u0027m laughing.   The word had been recorded over a decade ago as part of a project for Vocabulary, a website dedicated to helping students master new words. The New York-based Broadway and theatre actor was working at JP Morgan at the time of the clip’s recording but successfully auditioned for the job of voice actor. I wound up recording about 36,000 words and phrases, the whole process took about two or three months. The one that sticks out the most to me was Ethel Merman...typical for a Broadway kid, right?  So far the clip has been analysed and shared around the world by major celebrities, including Ellen De Generes, Chloe Feldman and even US president Donald Trump. Millions of people have debated whether the word in question is either Laurel or Yanny, with most apparently opting for Laurel Experts say the frequency of the sound is experienced differently by some brains, meaning that some people heard two completely different words when the sound is played.

Jan Mai, 50, was detained by German police on Friday after the body of Irina Aizina was found on Wednesday. The 29-year-old mother-of-one, originally from Moldova, had been stabbed up to 20 times and mutilated beyond recognition. The chilling discovery was made by a dog walker at a Frankfurt park.  The pair hit the headlines earlier this year when Mr. Mai claimed his nightclub venue \u0027First\u0027 had been attacked by up to “50 Arab” men during New Year\u0027s Eve 2016, The Daily Beast reported. The men had raided the venue and had groped the hostesses before making off with their jackets, according to Mai\u0027s account of events. Ms Aizina had been interview by journalists in relation to the alleged attack and backed up Mr. Mai\u0027s claims. She said she had been groped everywhere“ and had said she was “lucky she had been wearing tights.”  The accusations echoed a spate of sexual assaults in central Cologne on December 31, 2015. The disclosure left many Germans shocked following a government decision to grant asylum to up to one million refugees the previous year.  Mai\u0027s revelations further exacerbated tensions in the country and led to a headline by German\u0027s right-leaning publication Bild, with the headline “Sex Mob Rages on Frankfurt Restaurant Strip.” “They streamed inside here,” Mai said. “They put on the jackets of the guests and marched outside with the jackets. They grabbed the girls from behind.” Investigating authorities soon grew suspicious particularly after it was revealed Aizina had been celebrating New Year in Belgrade at the time. Charges were later filed by police against the pair for falsely reporting a crime. Authorities claimed that the two had simply made up the incident to garner publicity for their struggling nightclub.

at least two targets are at an advanced stage and deals could be struck over the weekend.Dunfermline pair Fraser Aird and Nicky Clark could be on the verge of joining up.While United have declined to confirm their interest in Clark, the 26-year-old’s proven scoring record at Championship level is something of which they are aware.And despite interest in him from the Premiership – St Mirren have also been linked – a determined effort to get him to Tannadice appears to be ongoing.Ex-Hamilton defender Ziggy Gordon is also on their radar and he could be fixed up soon.With other identified targets, the process could take longer.While the departures of 14 players means replacements are needed, and soon, as much time as is needed to ensure the right quality is obtained for next season will be taken.With the season just over, a number of players and agents are on their summer break and that will delay some business. In other cases, the calibre of those involved means United will battle with other clubs to get them.The fact they are remaining outside of the Premiership for a third season running makes that task harder – but it’s not being seen as an insurmountable one.And the number of players who’ve expressed an interest in hearing what the plans for the new-look squad are has been encouraging.There will be action at Tannadice tonight as Dave Bowman’s annual match to raise cash for skin cancer and dementia charities takes place.It will see a string of other past Tangerines greats turning out in the home ranks.“We’ve got the usual list of suspects and Sean Dillon and Jon Daly will be back in United strips as well,” said Bow.“We’ve even got your columnist in the Tele, big Lee Wilkie, playing.

Sometimes you just have to look after yourself, make sure you give your team the best chance to go and win a game by making saves when you need to.“All I did really in that Partick game was do my job.“I conceded a goal which is very annoying because I just want to keep clean sheets – that’s what goalkeepers are built on.“I wasn’t happy about that but, overall, it was a pleasing performance for myself.”And Ferrie did impress, making timely saves as well as commanding his area with Partick quickly putting the rookie keeper under pressure from the off.An early save that saw him claw an Adam Barton header out of the top corner set him on his way and, although he couldn’t stop Kris Doolan poking in the winner, he was happy with this performance.On that Barton header: “It had me worried when it was looping over me! I was thinking ‘oh, no, it’s looping, it’s looping, please get there!’“I managed to just get there and then, after that, there was a corner and with a young keeper they were going to put it on me. That’s what anyone does with a young keeper, and I got a good punch on it.“I felt that was important because it meant they maybe didn’t put it on me as much. I found in the second half they didn’t. The crosses were a bit further out, which was good.“Teams might look at that because I’m maybe not as big as other goalkeepers. I’m 6ft 1in but it doesn’t matter, you just have to be dominant and you get yourself out for crosses.“I’ve always tried to do that because I always think if you attack it 100% you can get there even if they are six foot seven or eight.“If you want that ball more than them then you can go get it.”His displays in training and for the successful U/20 side, saw him handed another year’s deal by Dundee and Ferrie is determined to make the most of the chance he’s been given.He added: “It was good to get that signed, get secure for next year knowing I can come back and work 100% again to make sure that gets me as far as I can go.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/02/wf-863x575.jpg ","title":"free dundee waterfront wi fi to be working by summer","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA free public Wi-Fi scheme will be operational at Dundee Waterfront by the end of July, it has been revealed.Mike Galloway, executive director of city development, has given assurances the service will start with a temporary set-up for Slessor Gardens by July 31, with a wider area operational before the V\u0026ampA opens on September 15.Mr Galloway also confirmed provision for Union Street, Crichton Street, Castle Street and Reform Street will be operational by September 7, with a permanent solution for Slessor Gardens expected to be in place by November 16.However, he said the work was still “out for tender”, adding that dates may have to be revised slightly when a preferred bidder has been appointed.It is understood no specific timelines have been given for introducing free Wi-Fi to the City Square area, although all firms bidding to provide the service have stated this should be completed by the end of the year.Paul Jennings, chairman of Visit Dundee, said free Wi-Fi being available in time for the V\u0026ampA’s opening was “brilliant” news and “could create real economic benefits” for the city.“We’re looking at an influx of visitors to Dundee and I think their ability to access information on the move is going to be key,” he said.“That ability to access content live – whether it’s nearby restaurants, shops or other attractions – could be really useful in providing a boost for the local economy.”City councillor Fraser Macpherson said the service could provide a “boon” for the city and added: “Many cities are discovering free Wi-Fi is a good way to attract more visitors.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/10/SMac_Invertay_House_Maule_Monifieth17100501.jpg-846x564.jpg ","title":"fresh hope of building facility for local community","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlans to build a new community centre in the local area could be back on the table.The Monifieth Community Resource Group (MCRG) suffered a huge setback in March when a £1 million request to the Big Lottery Fund to refurbish Invertay House was rejected.The former school building was earmarked to be turned into a multi- purpose centre to hold sports and community events.Angus Council had most recently used the premises to process benefit inquiries, but agreed to the community asset transfer in August last year.Jean Lee, chairwoman of MCRG, said: “Before Invertay House was declared surplus to requirements by Angus Council, and we began the whole process, we had done a huge amount of work on the potential development of a community hub on land beside the Blue Seaway.\u0026#8220We were at the stage of being ready to apply to the Big Lottery for funding. Our plans were well advanced and we were very enthusiastic about them.“However, the decision was made to shelve those plans and pursue the option of Invertay House because it was accepted it had always been first choice of building by the community.”However, £2m was needed to realise the ambition, and with the Big Lottery grant application having been turned down, the MCRG is now considering the previous plan to build a brand new facility in the Blue Seaway park area, near to the waterfront, in conjunction with Monifieth Athletic FC.Jean said: “The Blue Seaway option is now again our best option.“We can have a fit-for-purpose building in a magnificent setting – a building that provides for local groups, community events and individuals who just want to have somewhere to socialise, an activities space that will ensure the viability of the whole community project.“Monifieth needs this building and we are ready again to start work on making it happen. We have had very positive preliminary discussions with Monifieth Athletic to take this forward as a joint project.“They had ambitions to create a sports hub down at the riverfront and we had always shared the understanding that we would support them in this ambition after we had secured our community centre.

They started to chase after the car in case he injured someone and the bouncer told him to give him the keys.Police were called and Palade disappeared, however when police attended, he returned with a spare set of keys and tried to get into his car and start it up.Officers prevented him from doing so and a roadside breath test showed a reading of 134 mics. He was then taken to Bell Street HQ but would not agree to provide two further specimens of breath and would not provide any explanation, Mrs Bruce said.Solicitor Nicola Brown told the court Palade had “panicked” when told what the roadside breath test reading was and had failed to provide further tests.She said in terms of the driving offence, he had driven about 300 metres.Ms Brown said he had gone to the pub for a drink with a colleague but ended up consuming far more than he had intended and had foolishly decided to move his car away from the restricted parking area he was in to avoid getting a parking ticket the following day.She said he intended to sell the car to pay for any fine that was imposed.Sheriff Alastair Carmichael fined Palade £800 and banned him from driving for 16 months.

coach Dave Bowman’s charity match against a team of fans at Tannadice on Friday night.It was the first time since January he’d kicked a ball in anger and leaves him on course to be ready for the start of pre-season training next month.The man who won promotion from the Championship with Hamilton, Hearts and Hibs was seen as a key signing when he joined after leaving the Hibees last summer.However, the first season of a two-year deal was ruined by a catalogue of injuries.Early in the campaign he was sidelined by an ankle problem and he hasn’t played since being forced out by a groin condition in January.That led to surgery but, in recent weeks, he has been building his fitness and has now reached the stage where he can resume playing.Also turning out for the United greats team on Friday was Craig Easton, with whom talks over a youth coaching role at Tannadice are continuing.Easton taking charge of the development of the club’s young talent remains very much on the cards.The 39-year-old was himself a product of United’s youth policy and went on to make more than 200 appearances for the club before continuing his career with Livingston and then a string of lower division clubs south of the border.Once his playing days were over, he did some coaching in England and, for the past two years, has been in charge of the youths at Raith Rovers.

If it doesn’t work out, the only person I will blame is myself but I feel the move to Dundee has been good for me because it’s got me a lot more Premiership experience.”He admits had the loan interest at the turn of the year been from someone other than Dundee, there’s a fair chance he would have opted to stay put.“A lot’s been said about me being a Dundee fan and that was a factor.“More important was it was a move that wasn’t going to involve me having to get used to a new city or league.“I stayed at my mum’s when I was back up and I already knew some of the boys, so it was easy to settle in. I’m not saying I wouldn’t have gone somewhere else but all that made it an easier choice to come.”And, as a proud Dundonian, Murray admits the fact he’s joined a select band of players to have worn dark blue and tangerine is pleasing.“I will look back at the end of my career and be proud I played for Dundee and United. While I’m a Dundee fan, even before I was at United I was never one who didn’t want them to do well.“I always went to see both teams and I still do. I’m a football fan and I want to see both sides from my city doing well.“Now I’ve got a United connection, they are a club I will always have a lot of time for.“They were the team that gave me my chance in the game full-time and I’m grateful for that.“I still know a lot of people there and they are very good people who I respect a lot.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b03eb36a6964-e1526984625691-490x564.jpg ","title":"wwe star drew mcintyre salutes dundee grappler after tournament win","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee wrestler has been given a glowing endorsement by a WWE superstar after winning a tournament in his honour.Adam Hastings — who performs under the name Irving Garrett — was recently crowned the winner of the first Drew Galloway Invitational.The 26-year-old fought off stiff competition from other up-and-coming grapplers to win the event in Glasgow.Drew, competing for WWE as Drew McIntyre, took to Twitter to congratulate the city centre man on his achievement.The former Intercontinental and NXT champion said:\u0026mdash Drew McIntyre (@DMcIntyreWWE) May 13, 2018The seal of approval from his fellow Scotsman has led to a flood of interest from promoters across the UK.Speaking to the Tele, Adam said: “It was really cool to be able to win that, especially considering it was in Drew’s name.“It was amazing that he Tweeted out that support, and since then I’ve had lots of people getting in touch on Twitter.“I’ve always been such a huge fan of wrestling and my family knew I was always going to get into it.

artwork","story":"\u0026nbspAN alternative artwork to replace the controversial tilting pier concept proposed for the banks of the River Ness will be showcased at a public exhibition next week.Designs, to be displayed at Inverness Town House on May 24, have thrilled councillors who have had a peek at an international architect\u0027 new offering.The images are being kept under wraps for now. But the Courier understands the \u0026pound370,000 art installation, still branded by Highland Council as the Gathering Place, will be divided into two sections positioned on either side of the river. The installation is thought to be a mix of stone and wooden construction.There is great excitement among city councillors who have seen two-dimensional design work, and there is apparent consensus that it is aesthetically pleasing and will easily blend into the local, tranquil environment.The \"pier\" project, proposed for a spot by Eden Court, was aborted two years ago due to the scale of public objections to the design.The location for the new proposal is believed to be nearby, slightly further upriver, at the most shallow point on the edge of the Ness Islands.The council\u0027 Inverness city committee delegated powers of approval to the Inverness city arts working group. Its current chairwoman, councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, said she had closely scrutinised the fresh concept adding that it was \"within budget\".Giving little away, she added: \"I can see it appealing to the local community. It\u0027 innovative and there are a variety of ways to use it.\"The artwork is believed to be static and radically different from the previous offering.Fellow city councillor Duncan Macpherson said: \"The whole thing looks good. I think people who use this walkway regularly will be impressed. It\u0027 enhancing.\"People will be happy with it because they\u0026rsquove heeded public opinion.\"They\u0026rsquove taken the key aspects of the best features of the River Ness \u0026ndash its shape, the salmon fishing, the popularity of it. It enhances a current meeting place and it\u0027 a natural walkway.\"It\u0027 a good design, in the right place and way better. It\u0027 a natural \u0026lsquogathering place\u0026rsquo unlike the previous design which was very modern. That may go on to be a great success in another city but it wasn\u0026rsquot for Inverness or the location.\"A two-day public consultation was held last December at the city\u0027 railway station and in the Eastgate Shopping Centre to gather opinions about the overall riverside arts project to consider \"how the river should connect with the people and community of Inverness\".The arts initiative has been plagued by complaints about design and costs.The council has consistently stressed that the overall \u0026pound759,000 project, featuring a range of different art installations, is publicly funded but largely through ring-fenced grants.They were \u0026ndash Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,600), the Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound281,000), the council\u0027 \"cities gateway\" initiative (\u0026pound66,000), Highlands and Islands Enterprise (\u0026pound66,000) and a further \u0026pound40,000 from the council. Backers also emphasised that if Inverness spurned the project the funding would simply go elsewhere in Scotland.The local authority\u0027 Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"It is in development and about to be revealed to the public.\"I\u0026rsquom confident the new proposal will prove a big hit for the city.
