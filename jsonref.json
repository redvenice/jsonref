She managed to break free when her mobile phone rang and she unlocked the door before escaping.The alleged incident was one of several unwanted advances made towards the woman by Ihsan between January and April last year after he rented the property in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire.The GP was subsequently asked to leave by the managers at the apartment block after the woman complained.The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service was told the housekeeper had been employed to clean various flats at the complex where Ihsan had taken out a lease on a serviced property.Lawyers for the General Medical Council Helena Duong told the Manchester hearing: \u0027She was responsible for cleaning his room and on a number of occasions, he was present when she was cleaning the room.\u0027On one incident in her statement she went to the room to collect her keys which she had left behind and Dr Ihsan opened the door with a towel around his waist.          Dr Mohammed Ihsan, 36, approached the woman whilst he was dressed only in a towel around his waist and told her: \u0027I\u0027m looking for some fun,\u0027 it is alleged\u0027After she retrieved her keys, he dropped his towel and exposed his bottom in her sight. The next incident happened about a week after this when she was making his bed sheets.\u0027He came behind her and he put his bottom on top of hers. She describes feeling uncomfortable and moving away.\u0027About three weeks later, she was cleaning the room and she walked past his en-suite bathroom and he was using the shower and his door was open. We say he did this on purpose to expose himself to her.\u0027On April 4, while Ms A was cleaning his room, she went to get some things from the trolley outside and when she returned she saw Dr Ihsan with a towel around his waist. He said to her that they had \u0027chemistry\u0027 and he locked the door.\u0027He pushed her into the corner and said that he \u0027wanted to have fun\u0027 but she said that she is \u0027not that type of person\u0027.

She managed to break free and unlock the door and escape. These are unwanted sexual advancements towards Ms A.\u0027Following the alleged incidents the housekeeper became nervous when she was about to clean Ihsan\u0027s room but at first did not tell her partner about the incidents.She later broke down in tears and told him when she said she wanted to get a new job. She subsequently told her manager who then rang police on her behalf. Another manager later got in contact with Ihsan and suggested he move out.In a statement Ms A said: \u0027I didn\u0027t want to tell my partner because I know he would go mad and would not let me go back into work.\u0027When asked how she did eventually tell him she replied: \u0027Yes I said to him how I got a bit upset at work and asked whether he remembered me telling him about that doctor. I said there was a bit of an incident again where he put his hands down the back of my trousers.\u0027Recalling one incident she said: \u0027I was situated with my back to the wardrobe. He bent over to open the wardrobe and his bottom touched mine. He did not say sorry for his bottom touching mine.\u0027Describing another she said: \u0027He came out and stood behind me and he was very close. I went a bit further up the door. He came up to me and locked the door so I pushed myself further up the door.\u0027She agreed with Miss Duong when she put it to Ms A: \u0027You say that the towel drops and Dr Ihsan exposes himself and then you say that he makes some other comments to you and then you say that you pushed him away against his bare chest.\u0027You then tell us about your phone ringing. You told him it was your boss calling. He replied that there were not any cameras in the room but you said that your boss would know that you were in there and you quickly unlocked the front door.\u0027In November last year Ihsan was suspended for nine months after being found guilty of misconduct.He quizzed a patient about her sex life during a routine appointment, and he told a second patient he was \u0027horny\u0027 and asked to see her bottom at his surgery in South Kirby, Wakefield.  At the time Dr Ihsan said he acknowledged the seriousness of his actions and was sorry for what had happened. Ihsan, from Huddersfield, denies sexually motivated misconduct.

The Dare Stone (either side is pictured) – named because it is believed to be written by Eleanor White Dare, Roanoke Governor John White\u0027s daughter – was found  on the North Carolina-Virginia border          In a recent study done by Brenau University, who owns the Dare Stone, a small part of it was cut off for an analysis of the chemicals and minerals present. The elements they found have helped determine where in Virginia the stone is likely from. However, more work is needed to figure out if the stone is a forgery or notMorrison heard about the Dare Stones for the first time 11 years ago, during his first week on the job at the university.\u0027I had never heard of them and I was sitting at my desk one day and I got an email message from somebody that wanted to know why we were hiding away these valuable artifacts in a 16th century mausoleum and wanted to know why,\u0027 he tells DailyMail.com.\u0027It was kind of odd because there was no Georgia in the 16th century, let alone Brenau University with a mausoleum,\u0027 he says. The state of Georgia was founded in 1732 and the university in 1878.Soon after the accusatory email, Morrison says he got dozens of other inquiries from people who wanted to take rubbings of the Dare Stones. He found out that was a scavenger hunt task created to promote the 400th anniversary celebration of Jamestown. He also found out who sent that first email.Los Angeles police hunt for USC PhD student, 22, who...¿She was murdered¿: Cold case breakthrough as police find...Rare and unseen pictures of The Who taken by super-fan who...Share this article    The Lost Colony of Roanoke has captured the world\u0027s imagination for hundreds of years, in some ways particularly because among the missing colonists is the first English child to be born in the New World, Virginia Dare (pictured in a woodcut in \u0027North Carolina Illustrated\u0027 in Harperís New Monthly Magazine, 1857)He adds later: \u0027It\u0027s just a good story is what happened to that colony. You could simplify it and say they signed everybody up saying well we\u0027re trying to start a colony at that location several times and it hasn\u0027t worked out because it\u0027s just too dangerous. If the Indians don\u0027t get you, the weather will… and that\u0027s probably what happened to them, one or the other. And so, mystery solved. But that\u0027s not good enough. People really want to know the whole story.\u0027After two other groups had previously landed at Roanoke Island – the first to explore and chart the area in 1584 and the second to unsuccessfully attempt a colony in 1586 before returning to England a year later – Governor John White led a group of about 115 men, women and children, including his pregnant daughter Eleanor White Dare, to the site in 1587. Several weeks after they landed there on August 18, Eleanor gave birth to the first English baby born in the New World and named her Virginia Dare.Governor White soon returned to England to ask for more supplies, but he was held up in England for three years while the English warred with Spain. When he was finally able to make it back in 1590 on his granddaughter\u0027s third birthday, Roanoke was empty. Houses were dismantled and there wasn\u0027t a person in sight. There was also no sign of their agreed-upon emergency symbol: a cross. The only hints at the colonists\u0027 whereabouts were the letters \u0027Cro\u0027 carved on a tree and the word \u0027Croatoan\u0027 carved on a gatepost.Croatoan was an island south of Roanoke as well as the name of a Native American tribe who had befriended the colonists, according to a new book about Roanoke called The Secret Token by Andrew Lawler. According to his notes, Governor White was relieved to know the colonists were safe.Bad weather conditions prevented White from going to the second island and he was instead forced to return to England. The Roanoke colonists were never seen again.The mystery has sparked plenty of theories, both realistic and outlandish. Plausible theories suggest they died from disease, were massacred by either Native Americans or Spanish settlers or assimilated into a nearby Native American tribe, either as friends or slaves. More fantastic theories include alien abductions or death by zombie apocalypse.Twenty years after Roanoke was founded, the more successful colony of Jamestown was settled 100 miles north in Virginia by the Virginia Company of London in 1607. Though this colony was threatened with failure after two years of disease, famine and conflict, a second group of settlers in 1610 ensured Jamestown\u0027s success.          The Lost Colony of Roanoke\u0027s mystery became popular in 1937 when then-President Franklin Roosevelt dedicated a commemorative stamp to Virginia Dare for her 350th birthday. In the same year, a man named Louis Hammond claimed he found a 21-pound stone on the North Carolina-Virginia border. The stone had undecipherable carvings on it, so he brought it to Emory University\u0027s history department hoping someone there could read it. Three of the Emory scholars Haywood Pearce, Jr (center), James G Lester (left) and Ben W Gibson (right) are pictured with the Dare Stone          The Emory scholars were able to translate the messages on either side of the stone, which tells the gruesome and sad fate of the Roanoke colonists, if it is authentic. However, there were some doubts of the stone\u0027s authenticity among the higher ups at Emory, so Brenau University bought it. Brenau was run by Haywood Pearce Jr\u0027s father    Pearce Jr was unsuccessful in finding any other Dare Stones, so he opened up the search to the public, promising that Brenau would pay anyone who found any stones with carvings on them. Brenau\u0027s current president, Ed Schrader (right), who is also a geologist, is pictured discussing different stones at the University of North Carolina in Asheville for a History Channel program about the Dare Stones           The Pearces were somehow convinced of their legitimacy, Lawler writes, but Eberhardt\u0027s hoax was soon uncovered by the Saturday Evening Post in 1941, which left Brenau embarrassed. Pictured: Flour is applied to the Dare Stones to try and match stones up with the translated text          \u0027Where do you put rocks?\u0027 Morrison says. \u0027We weren\u0027t crowing about them. We weren\u0027t showing them off or anything, but I don\u0027t think they were actually hiding them. I think they were just done with them. There was no champion for them around anymore and they just sort of languished around, no further advancement on them at all.\u0027 Schrader is pictured examining the original Dare Stone          In 2016, Brenau brought the Dare Stone to the geology department at the University of North Carolina at Asheville, where they have the equipment needed to cut a small part of the stone and do mineral and chemical analyses, which was also featured on a History Channel program in March 2017          The Dare Stone sits near a saw before a sample is taken during the filming of the 2017 History Channel program at the University of North Carolina Asheville          During the 2016 analysis, they found that the stone is almost completely pure white vein quartz with amounts of gold, selenium and copper, which helped narrow down the possible location of the stone to an area in southern Virginia, about 60 miles upriver from the approximate location of where the stone was found in 1937          Their next step, Morrison says, is to determine how thick the layer of patina, or film produced from oxidation, is around the stone, to pinpoint when the carving actually happened. They are also trying to put together a comprehensive team to thoroughly study the stone      ¿Dare Stone¿ Highlighted in Second Two-hour History Channel Program - Brenau University"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/17/16/4E55059900000578-5962817-image-a-53_1531841061752.jpg","title":"Abandoned Disney park Florida captured eerie photographs","story":"    Disney opened River Country, the company\u0027s first ever water park and perhaps the first themed water park anywhere in the world, in 1976 before it closed its doors in 2001          The park was designed as an \u0027old-fashioned swimming hole\u0027 next to Bay Lake.

Then in 1989 another 13-year-old boy drowned at the park, but despite the many setbacks it continued to operate throughout the Nineties, though visitor numbers dwindled          On the first day of September 2001 the park shut for seasonal maintenance, but just ten days later the Twin Towers were attacked in New York. Amid a country-wide fall in tourism, River Country never reopened          The fate of River Country hung in the balance for several years before Disney announced its official closure in 2005. The company has never given an official reason for the closure          River Country could about to be reinvented as a themed hotel and timeshare resort under the mysterious name of \u0027Project 89\u0027, with construction slated to begin at some point next yearAnother 13-year-old boy then drowned in 1989, but despite this the park kept operation for more than a decade afterwards.However, the terror attacks on the Twin Towers in 2001 saw tourist revenue to the US plummet and Disney was forced to cut opening hours at all its parks to cope with the loss.River Country had closed its door in September of that year for seasonal maintenance and was expected to open again in 2002, but that never happened.For the next three years the park sat abandoned before Disney announced its permanent closure in 2005. The company has never given a reason, though likely falling revenues and the fact that it had since opened two larger water parks at Disney World persuaded them there was a better use for the land.However, the park could soon be about to come back to life, with the Orlando Sentinel reporting in May this year that Disney is planning to develop the land into a new themed hotel and timeshare resort.The construction, mysteriously dubbed Project 89, is due to start at some point next year though no opening date has been given.

Instead, they pay rising annual fees to the freeholder, and often face onerous terms that can prevent them carrying out home improvements.Former Communities Secretary Sajid Javid described leasehold sales as ‘unjustified’ and last year announced a ban that will force developers to sell new homes as freehold.But despite the crackdown, there are no laws to help the hundreds of thousands of families who have already bought leasehold homes. Experts believe these properties will soon be seen as ‘damaged goods’ and may become hard to sell as their values fall.This week, Money Mail found two estates in Lancashire which were still being marketed as leasehold. Homes on the Douglas Meadow estate, outside Chorley, are on the market from Stewart Milne Homes for £267,950 for a detached four-bedroom or £399,950 for a five-bedroom, with shared landscaped park and play areas. Each house is leasehold and owners pay an annual ground rent of £250, which is reviewed in line with Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation every ten years.Leasehold homes on the Jones Homes estate at Rivington Grange, in Horwich, Bolton, cost up to £199,950 for a three-bedroom, while a four-bedroom semi costs up to £252,950. Ground rents are understood to be about £200 a year for a £200,000 house, and are reviewed every 15 years in line with inflation.The used cars RISING in value: Buyers are snapping up...China\u0027s £1.7bn raid for British tech talent... as another UK...Royal Mail letter volumes decline as new data rules bite...Boardroom blitz!

Many of those hit were first-time buyers, some of whom used the Government’s Help to Buy scheme to purchase homes with a 5per cent deposit. If their property price falls, they face going into negative equity.Typically the leases they have last between 250 and 999 years. In some cases, their annual rent to the freeholder - who owns the land under the property - is scheduled to double every decade. That means a ground rent which starts at £250 a year rises to £500 a year after ten years, £1,000 after 20 years and £2,000 after 30.For property developers, this income stream can be lucrative. Many builders make extra profit by selling the freeholds - and all future ground rent income - to investment firms.          Catherine Gale, 44, fears she faces a huge loss on her three-bedroom house outside Bolton. Catherine, who is orced, bought the property in 2007 for £200,000In theory, homeowners retain the right to buy the freehold at a later date under the Leasehold Reform Act. But the prices set by freeholders can be tens of thousands of pounds. The contracts also state that leaseholders who want to make changes to their home - for instance, adding a conservatory - must often seek permission from the freeholder and pay a fee.Some who bought leasehold houses are already struggling to move home. Potential buyers fear the properties could become unsellable after the ban comes into force, and solicitors warn that banks have stopped lending on many leasehold properties where ground rents are due to double every decade.Some banks are refusing to offer loans if the ground rent is more than 0.1per cent of the property’s value (i.e. £100 a year on a £100,000 flat). Karen and David Wilson had feared the leasehold scandal would leave them £92,000 out of pocket. In 2012, they bought a two-bed flat in Leeds from a private seller for their son Ben, now 35.          An estimated 200,000 families are stuck with blighted leasehold homes. If their property price falls, they face going into negative equityThe family tried to sell when Ben, a teacher, decided to move back to their home town of Ulverston in Cumbria. They found a buyer, but a day before completion the purchaser pulled out. Their solicitor had highlighted that the flat had a doubling ground rent clause in the lease.The family begged the freeholder to link the ground rent to RPI inflation instead, which should make it easier to sell. It initially refused, but relented after Money Mail intervened.Catherine Gale, 44, fears she faces a huge loss on her three-bedroom house outside Bolton. Catherine, who is orced, bought the property in 2007 for £200,000. Now she needs to move to provide more space for her three children, two of whom have autism. She struggles to afford the £500 ground rent, which is set to double every ten years.But homes on the estate have sold at tens of thousands of pounds less than their original price, she says. Catherine adds that although she knew the property was leasehold, she had little idea of what this meant. The developer, Taylor Wimpey, has since offered to allow Catherine and other owners on the estate the chance to link their ground rents to RPI inflation. It argues that this should make it cheaper for sellers to buy the freehold.But under Catherine’s current arrangement, ground rents can only increase five times under the RPI deal being offered, the number of increases will be unlimited. And if owners such as Catherine sign up for the change, they must waive their rights to take legal action against Taylor Wimpey over the doubling ground-rent clause. Catherine says: ‘I feel angry that we are all stuck.’A Taylor Wimpey spokesman says: ‘We listened to the concerns and difficulties some customers were facing as a result of their doubling ground-rent lease terms and have taken action to put it right.‘We have reached agreements with our freeholders who own their leases to enable the majority of customers with a ten-year doubling lease to convert their ground rent to an RPI‑based structure.‘The use of RPI-linked leases is a nationally recognised and long-established measure, and is the most commonly used index for price increases across the leasehold residential sector.’Tory Sir Peter Bottomley, who has campaigned on leasehold issues, says: ‘The people responsible for this scandal - the Government, developers and freeholders - have to fund a solution that is equitable and effective for families stuck with toxic leases.’A Stewart Milne Homes spokesman says: ‘All our developments in the North-West have been freehold since January 1, 2018, with the exception of Douglas Meadow, which was not available for us to purchase on a freehold basis.‘We have waived all admin charges and fees and arranged for a long lease that tracks the Retail Price Index to ensure there are no unexpected increases for our home buyers.’A Jones Homes spokesman declined to comment. £185 M\u0026S vouchers to switch and stayNo fees to use abroad"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/11/16/4E200E2E00000578-0-image-m-34_1531323892886.jpg","title":"Navy veteran tells duped selling bogus tractors eBay","story":"    Defrauded: Neil Burns was offered a job selling farm vehicles on eBay.

Worse still, Neil has ended up on the hook for more than £5,000 after an innocent shopper clawed back payment for undelivered goods.Neil, a qualified engineer from Hampshire, heard about the job through a legitimate website called People Per Hour, which connects freelance workers with businesses.In September last year he received an email from a People Per Hour user who called himself \u0027Thomas Sandberg\u0027.The used cars RISING in value: Buyers are snapping up...China\u0027s £1.7bn raid for British tech talent... as another UK...Royal Mail letter volumes decline as new data rules bite...Boardroom blitz!

Shortly after Neil listed the first item - a 2014 Kubota compact tractor (pictured above) for £5,600, plus £160 for delivery from Aberdeen - he started receiving emails from potential buyersMost wanted to view the vehicle before buying. This is a common request because eBay does not provide a money-back guarantee on vehicles sold through its website. But when Neil asked Sandberg if this was possible, he was told to say no.One buyer asked if the tractor was in full working order, why Neil was selling it, if he was the original owner and whether he was able to supply the original manuals and purchase documents.Neil went back to Sandberg, who told him to say that the tractor was in perfect working order and was being sold due to lack of space. Neil was told to say he was the original owner and would supply all the relevant paperwork.Foolishly, Neil went along with Sandberg\u0027s suggestion and the buyer paid £5,760 into Neil\u0027s PayPal account on the understanding that the tractor would be delivered within three days.As soon as the payment had been made, Sandberg asked Neil to transfer the money to his account. Sandberg said this was urgent because he wouldn\u0027t be able to deliver the vehicle to the buyer until he had received the money, as he had to pay his suppliers and delivery fees.          NatWest has refused to help Neil clear his debtsSandberg wrote: \u0027You will need to have a little trust in this deal, otherwise I will need you to cancel the transaction and refund the buyer.\u0027Neil then transferred the £5,026 to Sandberg\u0027s NatWest account, taking £734 for himself to cover his commission and eBay fees. The next day Sandberg sent Neil a new vehicle to list - a 2000 John Deere 4x4 tractor costing £4,500 plus £160 delivery. But this time a buyer messaged Neil shortly after making payment to say he\u0027d spotted the exact same photos of the tractor on an American website.It was at this point that Neil became suspicious that something was seriously wrong.When Neil asked Sandberg to confirm the vehicle was in his possession, he became defensive and ordered Neil to transfer payment immediately. Neil says: \u0027I told him if he was a legitimate seller there wouldn\u0027t be a problem. I tried to call him and couldn\u0027t get through so I sent a message saying unless he could show me the paperwork, I wasn\u0027t going to pay him.\u0027Sandberg never replied, so Neil thanked the buyer for bringing the photos to his attention and agreed to refund the payment, explaining that they had both been a victim of a scam. He contacted eBay and Action Fraud, the cybercrime reporting service, and his own bank The Cooperative Bank. But several weeks later, £5,760 was removed from his PayPal account.It turned out that the first buyer\u0027s bank had clawed back the payment for the 2014 Kubota compact tractor which had never been delivered. Banks can do this under so-called Chargeback rules for debit cards or Section 75 rules for credit cards.This plunged Neil thousands of pounds into debt. His PayPal and eBay account have been disabled until he repays the money, which he says he does not have. Neil has since discovered Sandberg\u0027s scam was linked to a larger police investigation into online fraud.In June, Money Mail revealed that nine major banks had allowed 82 accounts to be opened by a criminal gang using fake passports, driving licences and utility bills.Police found Sandberg\u0027s NatWest account among these and confirmed to Money Mail that Neil was a victim of crime.

Between March and May, the number of full-time workers increased to a new high of 23.9 million.The 388,000 figure is the equivalent of 1,063 jobs being created every day.Part-time workers decreased on the previous three months by 40,000 to 8.5million, despite the popularity of ‘gig economy’ jobs working for firms such as Uber and Deliveroo. There were only 1.41 million unemployed people who were actively looking for work between March and May, a fall of 84,000 on last year – driven by a rise in the number of women who had managed to find a job.Tara Sinclair, an economist for global jobs website Indeed, said: ‘The fuel on which the labour market runs – people wanting to get into work – is getting scarcer. So it’s both impressive and surprising that it is still managing to meet the demands of the economy’s job creation engine.’Britain’s unemployment rate of 4.2 per cent puts other European countries in the shade.

Although the jobs growth is encouraging, the slowing rises in pay could mean an interest rate hike will hamper consumer spending.A drop in stay-at-home carers led to a decline in the number of people not in work and not looking to work.

The 78-year-old reckons it was roughly £140, including storage, and thought at the time that it seemed like a fairly good deal.But last month her daughter Debbie Folkes read an article in the Mail about how some of the wills sold by banks such as NatWest included onerous terms and conditions that leave grieving families thousands of pounds out of pocket.When Debbie dug out the will, she discovered her mother had fallen victim to a major money‑making ploy used by nearly all the major banks in the late Nineties and early Noughties. In the small print, NatWest had reserved the right to act as executor of the will when Barbara died.That means NatWest and its solicitors, rather than Debbie or another family member or trusted friend, will be responsible for wrapping up her estate and dealing with everything from property sales to inheritance tax.In return for this service, the bank states it will charge a £1,500 administration fee and a whopping 2.5per cent of her mum\u0027s total estate (plus VAT). The estate is currently worth around £220,000 - so this works out at £7,000 plus VAT.The bank claims that Barbara chose to appoint NatWest as executor and that it was clear about its fees.

I am horrified NatWest could demand this money when they die.\u0027Barbara and Debbie are among dozens of readers who have written to Money Mail since we revealed that up to 1.5 million customers have been sold rip-off wills by banks.Families have begun trawling through the small print of their contracts and say they have discovered huge charges they knew nothing about. Some described how they successfully begged for a reduction in the fees. One man managed to get the fee cut from £14,000 to £6,000 after challenging his parents\u0027 bank.          Dozens of readers  have written to Money Mail since we revealed that up to 1.5 million customers have been sold rip-off wills by banksAnother family faced a £32,000 bill to administer their mother\u0027s estate, only for the bank to refuse to help when the will was challenged by a relative.Around the turn of the millennium, many major banks offered wills for as little as £75, or even at no upfront cost. They could afford to do this because they had loaded the terms and conditions with a catch that stated that the bank could appoint itself as executor of the will. That meant when the customer died, the bank could charge as much as 4.5per cent on the first £100,000 of the estate.Accountants say unless the estate is extremely complex, this can end up being hugely expensive. This is particularly true for modest estates that have benefited from soaring house prices.Jonathan Hoffman, an accountant who has advised on cases involving inheritance tax and wills since the Seventies, says: \u0027Banks should be charging an hourly fee based on how long it takes to deal with an estate.\u0027There is no reason why a simple case involving passing an estate between a husband and wife should be any more than ten hours of work. Even charged at £200 an hour this should amount to no more than £2,000.\u0027Some banks have reduced these fees in recent years — but they are still high. Lloyds, for example, charges 2.5per cent on the first £1 million of an estate. On a £500,000 estate this works out at £12,500.          When Sheena Hayes\u0027s aunt, Martha Mathers, died in 2008, Lloyds took £32,000 from her estate in charges for acting as an executor. Martha had died aged 81 without children, so left her estate - worth just under £1million - to eight nieces and nephews. Above, Sheena pictured with her familyNatWest charges 2.5per cent up to a maximum of £15,000 plus a £1,500 administration fee. A NatWest spokesman says: \u0027We offer upfront and transparent fees which are capped at a maximum amount. Where an estate is simple to administer we will look to offer a discount or, if appropriate, we will also offer the option for the bank to renounce. The bank is not automatically appointed as executor and customers are free to appoint a different executor at any time.\u0027The first Graham Penfold knew about these fees was when a smartly-dressed woman knocked on his mum\u0027s door a few days after his dad, Dennis, died 11 years ago. Graham and his wife Janice were staying at his family home in London to help his mum Margaret, then 79, plan the funeral and sort out his father\u0027s affairs.The woman said she had been sent by HSBC to discuss Dennis\u0027s will. Graham says she explained that the bank had been named as an executor and planned to charge £14,000 to administer the estate.          In the end, Graham and his family paid a total of £6,563 including VAT and legal advice fees for the will, with the breakdown of costs shown above. More than a decade later Graham, 66, says he still feel let down by the whole processA Lloyds Bank spokesman says it reimbursed the family for some of the solicitor\u0027s fees they incurred because of the challenging of the will.He says: \u0027We\u0027re sorry for Ms Hayes\u0027s loss of her aunt and the challenges she has had dealing with the estate. Family disputes, particularly involving larger estates, can be complex and occasionally result in additional legal issues which are not covered by standard fees. In this case, caveats were raised by family members which we tried to resolve with minimal legal costs. However, we were forced to seek specialist legal advice to resolve the situation.\u0027Another reader says her elderly friend\u0027s £310,000 estate was charged £16,000 by a bank to deal with matters after she died in 2008. This was on top of £4,406 paid to solicitors who handled the property sale.The reader also says she was told to contact the utility companies herself, along with sorting out other aspects of her friend\u0027s affairs.          From Money Mail\u0027s story last monthShe adds that she had no idea about the fees until she received the documents back from the bank around a year later. She says: \u0027At the time I just assumed that it was the typical charge for administering a will. But now I look back, I think that the bank did very little to earn such a huge fee.\u0027So if you\u0027ve discovered that your bank intends to charge you thousands of pounds to act as executor, what can you do?First, write to your bank and ask if it will stand down. Banks typically charge a fee of around £250 to remove their name as executor. However, if you live in England and Wales, it could refuse. (In Scotland they must agree to give up this responsibility when asked.)You can also try to negotiate to bring down the fees. If all else fails, tear it up and start again. In your new will, just include a line to clarify that it revokes all previous versions.If you opt for a professional writing service, choose the firm carefully will-writing is an unregulated business and there are rogue firms out there.Check that the company is signed up to an industry trade body, such as the Society of Will Writers or the Institute of Professional Will Writers. These enforce strict rules to which members must adhere. Solicitors are regulated by the Solicitors\u0027 Regulation Authority.You will likely be asked if you want to appoint the professional arranging your will as an executor. If your affairs are complicated, this could make sense. But check the fees. Beware if a firm tries to persuade you to appoint them as an executor. You may prefer to appoint a relative as an executor in the first place, particularly if your estate is relatively uncomplicated. If the executor needs legal help after you\u0027ve died, they can ask a probate broker such as Final Duties, which should provide a flat fee to deal with the estate.Even if your estate is more complex and you prefer a professional executor, then wherever possible try to include a relative as executor, too. They will understand your wishes better than a firm of solicitors.Most banks, including Zedra (which has taken over the Barclays probate business) and the Co-operative (which runs the former HSBC wills business), claim they will lower fees if an estate is very simple. NatWest says the same. So hold them to their word.Experts say as a rule of thumb that it should cost no more than £4,000 to administer a simple estate where no inheritance tax is due, savings are held in cash and there is a single property to be ided between your children.If an estate like this is being passed to your spouse, the fee should be even less. Higher charges may be justified if inheritance tax is due on the estate or if it includes stock market shares, which can take time to sell.If you or a loved one has already paid charges to the bank from the estate, you\u0027re unlikely to get your money back even if you believe the terms were unfair. However, it is still worth complaining to the bank. Lay out the fees and explain why you believe your loved one\u0027s estate was overcharged.If you do not get a satisfactory response, take your complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service. You can make a complaint six years from the event or three years from the time that you knew (or could have reasonably known) you had cause to complain.Even if your loved one died long ago, it may be possible to argue that you realised that the fees were excessive only after reading about the issue in Money Mail this year. £185 M\u0026S vouchers to switch and stayNo fees to use abroad"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/16/11/4E4EF0CD00000578-0-image-a-9_1531736814853.jpg","title":"Holidaymakers losing 1bn debit credit card fees abroad","story":"    British holidaymakers are often unaware of extra bank fees when withdrawing money from foreign ATMsMoment \u0027British tourist snorts cocaine off his wrist\u0027 in...\u0027I thought we were all gone\u0027: Radio star reveals her brush...The taste of freedom!

Kogan says it is possible the data was accessed by a hacker, but the \u0027access\u0027 could be as innocent as someone working for the company checking their emails while in Russia\u0027This could be really innocuous, it could be as simple as an SCL (Cambridge Analytica\u0027s British parent company) representative was in Russia and they remotely accessed the server to see some of the files.\u0027\u0027It could have nothing to do with the Russian authorities, it could just be someone checking their mailbox.\u0027The Information Commissioner\u0027s Office in Britain noted in a report issued last week Kogan had declined to meet with the office to be interviewed, but Kogan said he and his legal team were discussing speaking with the office.Trump REFUSES to call Russia an \u0027adversary\u0027 in Fox News...Share this articleLast week, 12 Russian intelligence agents were indicted on election meddling charges.The group are accused of hacking into Democratic email accounts during the 2016 presidential election and releasing stolen and damaging conversations.They are also accused of stealing information on 500,000 US voters after hacking a state US election board.  Hours after the indictment was released, Twitter suspended two accounts allegedly run by the agents, which were used to disperse the stolen information.Cambridge Analytica\u0027s Facebook data was accessed from Russia, MP saysThere is no guarantee the truth can spread more successfully than a campaign of disinformation | News | The Times"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/17/15/4E57B84B00000578-0-image-m-21_1531839578310.jpg","title":"Two portions TIRAMISU motorists drink drive limit","story":"    Tiramisu is usually made with brandy, Tia Maria or Amaretto and sometimes all threeChristmas pudding is also a no-no if you want to \u0027scoff and drive\u0027, with a normal festive pud containing 150ml of brandy, sherry, whisky or rum, although you\u0027d have to get through at least five slices to put you in danger.Boozy chocolates filled with alcohol - like Bailey\u0027s mini delights or cherry liquor chocs - can also put you over the limit, although you\u0027d need to scoff 850 to end up with a drink driving conviction, according to the study by vehicle leasing firm All Car Leasing.In Scotland, in particular, diners should beware after the Government introduced even more stringent drink driving laws in 2014, with drivers facing conviction if they have just one pint or glass of wine.The limit in Scotland is now 22 micrograms in 100ml of breath, compared to 35 micrograms in the rest of the UK.\u0027Drunk\u0027 driver \u0027three times over the legal alcohol limit is...Drunk dad, 31, is arrested for getting his one-year-old son...Share this articleIt\u0027s not just desserts which are a danger, with hot sauce, orange juice, peppercorn sauce and chicken marsala on the \u0027no go list\u0027.According to the study, dashing a whole bottle of hot sauce - like Jack Daniels Jalapeño or bourbon sauce - over your grub could end up with a drink driving conviction.Scoffing too much peppercorn sauce could also land you in bother if you get behind the wheel, with four servings of the tasty accompaniment - usually containing around 100ml of brandy - putting you over the limit.Chicken marsala is also a risk, as a dish for four contains around 250ml of Marsala, a Sicilian wine with an alcohol content of between 15-20 ABV, although you\u0027d need to scoff several portions to get pulled over by the police.Amazingly, orange juice is also on the list as it contains 0.5 ABV of alcohol, which is produced as the orange ferments, although you\u0027d need to down at least two pints of OJ to put you close to drink drive limits.

Instead, they pay rising annual fees to the freeholder, and often face onerous terms that can prevent them carrying out home improvements.Former Communities Secretary Sajid Javid described leasehold sales as ‘unjustified’ and last year announced a ban that will force developers to sell new homes as freehold.But despite the crackdown, there are no laws to help the hundreds of thousands of families who have already bought leasehold homes. Experts believe these properties will soon be seen as ‘damaged goods’ and may become hard to sell as their values fall.This week, Money Mail found two estates in Lancashire which were still being marketed as leasehold. Homes on the Douglas Meadow estate, outside Chorley, are on the market from Stewart Milne Homes for £267,950 for a detached four-bedroom or £399,950 for a five-bedroom, with shared landscaped park and play areas. Each house is leasehold and owners pay an annual ground rent of £250, which is reviewed in line with Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation every ten years.Leasehold homes on the Jones Homes estate at Rivington Grange, in Horwich, Bolton, cost up to £199,950 for a three-bedroom, while a four-bedroom semi costs up to £252,950.

Many of those hit were first-time buyers, some of whom used the Government’s Help to Buy scheme to purchase homes with a 5per cent deposit. If their property price falls, they face going into negative equity.Typically the leases they have last between 250 and 999 years. In some cases, their annual rent to the freeholder - who owns the land under the property - is scheduled to double every decade. That means a ground rent which starts at £250 a year rises to £500 a year after ten years, £1,000 after 20 years and £2,000 after 30.For property developers, this income stream can be lucrative. Many builders make extra profit by selling the freeholds - and all future ground rent income - to investment firms.          Catherine Gale, 44, fears she faces a huge loss on her three-bedroom house outside Bolton. Catherine, who is orced, bought the property in 2007 for £200,000In theory, homeowners retain the right to buy the freehold at a later date under the Leasehold Reform Act. But the prices set by freeholders can be tens of thousands of pounds. The contracts also state that leaseholders who want to make changes to their home - for instance, adding a conservatory - must often seek permission from the freeholder and pay a fee.Some who bought leasehold houses are already struggling to move home. Potential buyers fear the properties could become unsellable after the ban comes into force, and solicitors warn that banks have stopped lending on many leasehold properties where ground rents are due to double every decade.Some banks are refusing to offer loans if the ground rent is more than 0.1per cent of the property’s value (i.e. £100 a year on a £100,000 flat). Karen and David Wilson had feared the leasehold scandal would leave them £92,000 out of pocket. In 2012, they bought a two-bed flat in Leeds from a private seller for their son Ben, now 35.          An estimated 200,000 families are stuck with blighted leasehold homes. If their property price falls, they face going into negative equityThe family tried to sell when Ben, a teacher, decided to move back to their home town of Ulverston in Cumbria. They found a buyer, but a day before completion the purchaser pulled out. Their solicitor had highlighted that the flat had a doubling ground rent clause in the lease.The family begged the freeholder to link the ground rent to RPI inflation instead, which should make it easier to sell. It initially refused, but relented after Money Mail intervened.Catherine Gale, 44, fears she faces a huge loss on her three-bedroom house outside Bolton. Catherine, who is orced, bought the property in 2007 for £200,000. Now she needs to move to provide more space for her three children, two of whom have autism. She struggles to afford the £500 ground rent, which is set to double every ten years.But homes on the estate have sold at tens of thousands of pounds less than their original price, she says. Catherine adds that although she knew the property was leasehold, she had little idea of what this meant. The developer, Taylor Wimpey, has since offered to allow Catherine and other owners on the estate the chance to link their ground rents to RPI inflation. It argues that this should make it cheaper for sellers to buy the freehold.But under Catherine’s current arrangement, ground rents can only increase five times under the RPI deal being offered, the number of increases will be unlimited. And if owners such as Catherine sign up for the change, they must waive their rights to take legal action against Taylor Wimpey over the doubling ground-rent clause.

There were only 1.41 million unemployed people who were actively looking for work between March and May, a fall of 84,000 on last year – driven by a rise in the number of women who had managed to find a job.Tara Sinclair, an economist for global jobs website Indeed, said: ‘The fuel on which the labour market runs – people wanting to get into work – is getting scarcer. So it’s both impressive and surprising that it is still managing to meet the demands of the economy’s job creation engine.’Britain’s unemployment rate of 4.2 per cent puts other European countries in the shade.

Although the jobs growth is encouraging, the slowing rises in pay could mean an interest rate hike will hamper consumer spending.A drop in stay-at-home carers led to a decline in the number of people not in work and not looking to work.

The 78-year-old reckons it was roughly £140, including storage, and thought at the time that it seemed like a fairly good deal.But last month her daughter Debbie Folkes read an article in the Mail about how some of the wills sold by banks such as NatWest included onerous terms and conditions that leave grieving families thousands of pounds out of pocket.When Debbie dug out the will, she discovered her mother had fallen victim to a major money‑making ploy used by nearly all the major banks in the late Nineties and early Noughties. In the small print, NatWest had reserved the right to act as executor of the will when Barbara died.That means NatWest and its solicitors, rather than Debbie or another family member or trusted friend, will be responsible for wrapping up her estate and dealing with everything from property sales to inheritance tax.In return for this service, the bank states it will charge a £1,500 administration fee and a whopping 2.5per cent of her mum\u0027s total estate (plus VAT). The estate is currently worth around £220,000 - so this works out at £7,000 plus VAT.The bank claims that Barbara chose to appoint NatWest as executor and that it was clear about its fees.

I am horrified NatWest could demand this money when they die.\u0027Barbara and Debbie are among dozens of readers who have written to Money Mail since we revealed that up to 1.5 million customers have been sold rip-off wills by banks.Families have begun trawling through the small print of their contracts and say they have discovered huge charges they knew nothing about. Some described how they successfully begged for a reduction in the fees. One man managed to get the fee cut from £14,000 to £6,000 after challenging his parents\u0027 bank.          Dozens of readers  have written to Money Mail since we revealed that up to 1.5 million customers have been sold rip-off wills by banksAnother family faced a £32,000 bill to administer their mother\u0027s estate, only for the bank to refuse to help when the will was challenged by a relative.Around the turn of the millennium, many major banks offered wills for as little as £75, or even at no upfront cost. They could afford to do this because they had loaded the terms and conditions with a catch that stated that the bank could appoint itself as executor of the will. That meant when the customer died, the bank could charge as much as 4.5per cent on the first £100,000 of the estate.Accountants say unless the estate is extremely complex, this can end up being hugely expensive. This is particularly true for modest estates that have benefited from soaring house prices.Jonathan Hoffman, an accountant who has advised on cases involving inheritance tax and wills since the Seventies, says: \u0027Banks should be charging an hourly fee based on how long it takes to deal with an estate.\u0027There is no reason why a simple case involving passing an estate between a husband and wife should be any more than ten hours of work. Even charged at £200 an hour this should amount to no more than £2,000.\u0027Some banks have reduced these fees in recent years — but they are still high. Lloyds, for example, charges 2.5per cent on the first £1 million of an estate. On a £500,000 estate this works out at £12,500.          When Sheena Hayes\u0027s aunt, Martha Mathers, died in 2008, Lloyds took £32,000 from her estate in charges for acting as an executor. Martha had died aged 81 without children, so left her estate - worth just under £1million - to eight nieces and nephews. Above, Sheena pictured with her familyNatWest charges 2.5per cent up to a maximum of £15,000 plus a £1,500 administration fee. A NatWest spokesman says: \u0027We offer upfront and transparent fees which are capped at a maximum amount. Where an estate is simple to administer we will look to offer a discount or, if appropriate, we will also offer the option for the bank to renounce. The bank is not automatically appointed as executor and customers are free to appoint a different executor at any time.\u0027The first Graham Penfold knew about these fees was when a smartly-dressed woman knocked on his mum\u0027s door a few days after his dad, Dennis, died 11 years ago. Graham and his wife Janice were staying at his family home in London to help his mum Margaret, then 79, plan the funeral and sort out his father\u0027s affairs.The woman said she had been sent by HSBC to discuss Dennis\u0027s will. Graham says she explained that the bank had been named as an executor and planned to charge £14,000 to administer the estate.          In the end, Graham and his family paid a total of £6,563 including VAT and legal advice fees for the will, with the breakdown of costs shown above. More than a decade later Graham, 66, says he still feel let down by the whole processA Lloyds Bank spokesman says it reimbursed the family for some of the solicitor\u0027s fees they incurred because of the challenging of the will.He says: \u0027We\u0027re sorry for Ms Hayes\u0027s loss of her aunt and the challenges she has had dealing with the estate. Family disputes, particularly involving larger estates, can be complex and occasionally result in additional legal issues which are not covered by standard fees. In this case, caveats were raised by family members which we tried to resolve with minimal legal costs. However, we were forced to seek specialist legal advice to resolve the situation.\u0027Another reader says her elderly friend\u0027s £310,000 estate was charged £16,000 by a bank to deal with matters after she died in 2008. This was on top of £4,406 paid to solicitors who handled the property sale.The reader also says she was told to contact the utility companies herself, along with sorting out other aspects of her friend\u0027s affairs.          From Money Mail\u0027s story last monthShe adds that she had no idea about the fees until she received the documents back from the bank around a year later. She says: \u0027At the time I just assumed that it was the typical charge for administering a will. But now I look back, I think that the bank did very little to earn such a huge fee.\u0027So if you\u0027ve discovered that your bank intends to charge you thousands of pounds to act as executor, what can you do?First, write to your bank and ask if it will stand down. Banks typically charge a fee of around £250 to remove their name as executor. However, if you live in England and Wales, it could refuse. (In Scotland they must agree to give up this responsibility when asked.)You can also try to negotiate to bring down the fees. If all else fails, tear it up and start again. In your new will, just include a line to clarify that it revokes all previous versions.If you opt for a professional writing service, choose the firm carefully will-writing is an unregulated business and there are rogue firms out there.Check that the company is signed up to an industry trade body, such as the Society of Will Writers or the Institute of Professional Will Writers. These enforce strict rules to which members must adhere. Solicitors are regulated by the Solicitors\u0027 Regulation Authority.You will likely be asked if you want to appoint the professional arranging your will as an executor. If your affairs are complicated, this could make sense. But check the fees. Beware if a firm tries to persuade you to appoint them as an executor. You may prefer to appoint a relative as an executor in the first place, particularly if your estate is relatively uncomplicated. If the executor needs legal help after you\u0027ve died, they can ask a probate broker such as Final Duties, which should provide a flat fee to deal with the estate.Even if your estate is more complex and you prefer a professional executor, then wherever possible try to include a relative as executor, too. They will understand your wishes better than a firm of solicitors.Most banks, including Zedra (which has taken over the Barclays probate business) and the Co-operative (which runs the former HSBC wills business), claim they will lower fees if an estate is very simple. NatWest says the same. So hold them to their word.Experts say as a rule of thumb that it should cost no more than £4,000 to administer a simple estate where no inheritance tax is due, savings are held in cash and there is a single property to be ided between your children.If an estate like this is being passed to your spouse, the fee should be even less. Higher charges may be justified if inheritance tax is due on the estate or if it includes stock market shares, which can take time to sell.If you or a loved one has already paid charges to the bank from the estate, you\u0027re unlikely to get your money back even if you believe the terms were unfair. However, it is still worth complaining to the bank. Lay out the fees and explain why you believe your loved one\u0027s estate was overcharged.If you do not get a satisfactory response, take your complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service. You can make a complaint six years from the event or three years from the time that you knew (or could have reasonably known) you had cause to complain.Even if your loved one died long ago, it may be possible to argue that you realised that the fees were excessive only after reading about the issue in Money Mail this year. £185 M\u0026S vouchers to switch and stayNo fees to use abroad"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/17/15/4E57B84B00000578-0-image-m-21_1531839578310.jpg","title":"Two portions TIRAMISU motorists drink drive limit","story":"    Tiramisu is usually made with brandy, Tia Maria or Amaretto and sometimes all threeChristmas pudding is also a no-no if you want to \u0027scoff and drive\u0027, with a normal festive pud containing 150ml of brandy, sherry, whisky or rum, although you\u0027d have to get through at least five slices to put you in danger.Boozy chocolates filled with alcohol - like Bailey\u0027s mini delights or cherry liquor chocs - can also put you over the limit, although you\u0027d need to scoff 850 to end up with a drink driving conviction, according to the study by vehicle leasing firm All Car Leasing.In Scotland, in particular, diners should beware after the Government introduced even more stringent drink driving laws in 2014, with drivers facing conviction if they have just one pint or glass of wine.The limit in Scotland is now 22 micrograms in 100ml of breath, compared to 35 micrograms in the rest of the UK.\u0027Drunk\u0027 driver \u0027three times over the legal alcohol limit is...Drunk dad, 31, is arrested for getting his one-year-old son...Share this articleIt\u0027s not just desserts which are a danger, with hot sauce, orange juice, peppercorn sauce and chicken marsala on the \u0027no go list\u0027.According to the study, dashing a whole bottle of hot sauce - like Jack Daniels Jalapeño or bourbon sauce - over your grub could end up with a drink driving conviction.Scoffing too much peppercorn sauce could also land you in bother if you get behind the wheel, with four servings of the tasty accompaniment - usually containing around 100ml of brandy - putting you over the limit.Chicken marsala is also a risk, as a dish for four contains around 250ml of Marsala, a Sicilian wine with an alcohol content of between 15-20 ABV, although you\u0027d need to scoff several portions to get pulled over by the police.Amazingly, orange juice is also on the list as it contains 0.5 ABV of alcohol, which is produced as the orange ferments, although you\u0027d need to down at least two pints of OJ to put you close to drink drive limits.

This retrospective perfectly captures his unhurried pursuit of a now vanished Manhattan‘I simply looked at the world, not prepared for anything,” Saul Leiter said towards the end of his life. That sense of unhurriedness, coupled with a painterly eye for colour and composition, is palpable in his evocative colour photographs of New York. There is also an attentiveness that speaks of his disinterest in anything other than making the seemingly mundane world around him seem luminously beautiful.By the time he was “discovered” in 2006 with the publication of a book, Early Colour, he was 82. He had been working quietly for almost 60 years, first in monochrome, as a photojournalist, then in the 1950s, turning to colour to capture the rhythm and stillness of the same few streets around his Manhattan apartment in the soft, deep tones of Kodachrome slide film.Leiter’s late recognition brought him the kind of attention he had long avoided. In Tomas Leach’s thoughtful documentary, In No Great Hurry: 13 Life Lessons With Saul Leiter, he emerges as a reluctant object of attention. “What makes them think I’m any good?” he asks. In a sublime retrospective at the Foto Colectania gallery in Barcelona, there are 130 answers to that question, almost every one a testament to his singular talent. In Search of Beauty, which is currently drawing hushed and reverent crowds to the newly relocated gallery in Passeig Picasso, is a well-nigh perfect overview of Leiter’s career. In many ways, it is the perfect space for his deeply crafted images: the gallery is in a converted saddler’s that retains an artisanal atmosphere, with its wood-panelled offices and library enclosing a simple square space.Curator Roger Szmulewicz has wisely chosen to lead with Leiter’s signature colour photographs of Manhattan. Arranged in a single line around the perimeter, each one is a study in form, colour and atmosphere. This is not the overcrowded, fast-paced New York later caught by the likes of Garry Winogrand or Joel Meyerowitz. Instead, what Leiter captures, and heightens, is the atmosphere of another, older Manhattan – an almost sedate place, sometimes suffused with warm summer light, sometimes blanketed by falling snow.Often he shoots through steamed windows or catches a passing reflection. His subjects are stilled in a moment of reverie, waiting at traffic lights or daydreaming in a stalled vehicle. Sometimes he shot at night or at twilight, just as the light was fading, so that people appear as ghostly silhouettes against the deep reds and greens of advertising billboards and neon shop signs. He isolates lone human figures in stark relief against snow or rain. Umbrellas are a recurring motif, their circular geometry irresistibly drawing the eye, like a splash of red or orange in an impressionist painting. He was constantly alert, too, to the typographical poetry of street signs and lettering stencilled on shop windows. It all adds up to an intimate portrait of a time, a place and its passing people.The son of an Orthodox rabbi who fled the constrictions of a traditional Jewish upbringing in Pittsburgh to try to become an artist in mid-1940s New York, Leiter never lost his painter’s eye for colour and composition. Some of his images approach the purely abstract: shadows against blurred orange lights a dark silhouette just identifiable against a blur of passing cars people and things partially obscured by shadowy objects in the foreground. The result is a strange hybrid of intimate observation and heightened atmosphere, the creation of a New York that is familiar and slightly unreal in the way that certain paintings of the city are unreal – Edward Hopper’s work springs to mind. Leiter was a photographer possessed of a painter’s sensibility. He even made a series of painted nudes, applying paint on top of his photographic portraits to often vibrant effect.It is hardly surprising then, that in the earlier black and white work, New York seems like another city – more ghostly and gritty, less dreamlike. Here, too, Leiter plays with form, homing in on silhouettes, catching shafts of geometric light as they fall on faces and torsos. To some degree, that painter’s eye informs every photograph. Even more revelatory are the series of recently discovered intimate portraits, many of them collected in the new Steidl photo book, In My Room. In the 1950s and into the early 60s, Leiter photographed the women he knew – including his longtime partner-muse, Soames Bantry, and several of her model friends – mostly in his New York studio.The portraits, in grainy black and white, are certainly erotic, but in an almost languorous way. He captures his subjects in motion or in repose, sometimes seemingly unaware of his gaze, sometimes returning it with a provocative or accepting look. The few full nudes are the most abstract images, shadows falling on skin, the prints grainy and high contrast. Again, many of the images were taken through doors or screens, giving the sense of glimpsed intimate snapshots – except his compositional skill is so consistently finely honed as to make the term seem almost insulting. There is a relaxed intimacy to them that speaks of thoughtful collaboration between photographer and subject.After such richness, the single wall of Leiter’s colour fashion photography seems almost superfluous. One can see he was too singular an artist to be at ease in such a commercial sphere, yet he succeeds in making portraits that, as he put it later, looked “like a photograph rather than a fashion photograph”. More interesting still is the small collection of ephemera, in the wood-panelled library next door, that includes family snapshots, a sketchbook and palette knives.Half a dozen quotes by Leiter are stencilled on the walls of the gallery. One reads: “There is a tremendous advantage of being unimportant.” Another reads: “In some secret place in my being was a desire to avoid success.” Both give you some idea of Leiter’s temperament and the ways it informed the unhurried pursuit of his art. The almost devotional hush in the gallery as people peer at these images is testimony to a life devoted to the quiet pursuit of a singular vision and the avoidance of such distractions as fame or even recognition. For Leiter, simply looking at the world was enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ad2933a1fdd244d53a330e0ba9d0429d51fc413/950_1699_917_550/master/917.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bc78c291b98c74b541048e124f97051","title":"woman loses bid to have real estate agents handshake considered a violent","story":"Tribunal accepts agent’s explanation that he shook woman’s hand to say goodbye after 2017 auctionA woman who said she was injured when a real estate agent squeezed her hand after a Sydney property auction has lost her bid to be declared a victim of violent crime.The woman, who cannot be named, unsuccessfully challenged a decision by the commissioner of victims rights who found she was not the victim of any act of violence that could have entitled her to counselling or financial grants.“I do not find that the agent committed a crime by shaking the applicant’s hand firmly or in some other physically hard or aggressive manner,” concluded John Anthony, a senior member of the New South Wales civil and administrative tribunal.A senior assessor accepted the agent’s explanation that he shook the woman’s hand to say goodbye after the May 2017 unit auction.According to the woman, her left hand became swollen and she was in severe pain for several months. She said she went to the doctor, underwent physiotherapy treatments and reported the incident to police in August 2017.But she testified that the police report was “grossly inaccurate” and denied telling them she had screamed or shouted as loud as she could when the handshake occurred. She also denied saying she fainted at the scene and an ambulance was called.The woman further contended that police had no basis to make comments about her possible mental health issues.In Tuesday’s decision, Anthony referred to her evidence of the agent squeezing her hand tighter and tighter and of “pleading in her heart for him to stop”.She did not seek medical treatment at the time but said she bandaged her hand and produced a photo of it to the tribunal.Anthony said no explanation was given for the months-long delay in seeking medical treatment.“The police report does not in my view support any act of violence in the nature of a deliberate or reckless act that could be classified as an assault,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/346955435e382557b2489e05f1308feb23441c20/0_0_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf246388a66c0fa906c25c3711ef4444","title":"there there tommy orange review","story":"A sorrowful, beautiful debut novel follows a group of young “Urban Indians” struggling to make sense of their identityHow do you rewrite the story of a people? This question shapes Tommy Orange’s sorrowful, beautiful debut novel. Orange is an enrolled member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes of Oklahoma. There There is simultaneously the story of a small group of “Urban Indians” living in Oakland and the story of “Indians and Native Americans, American Indians and Native American Indians, North American Indians, Natives, NDNDs and Ind’ins, Status Indians and Non-Status Indians, First Nations Indians and Indians so Indian we either think about the fact of it every single day or we never think about it at all”. And to tell the story of his small cast of characters Orange gives his readers a sense of the great sweep of history that was initiated when a group of settlers showed up and took a continent from the people living there.The book’s prologue begins not with a character but with the Indian Head. The image of a headdress-wearing head was used as the TV test card after the day’s programming had ended. It appeared on US TVs until the 1970s. The head had no name. It had no body. It had no tribe. It was just the Indian Head. Orange moves from this glowing TV head to the severed head of the chief of the Wampanoag, which was kept on a spike outside the Plymouth colony. The prelude goes on to describe how European settlers murdered Native American people. “They tore unborn babies out of bellies, took what we were intended to be, our children before they were children, babies before they were babies.”Why all this history? Because Orange cannot rely on his readers to know it. Too many have been taught their history by saccharine Thanksgiving Day parades and cowboy movies in which Native Americans are acted by an “Italian guy named Iron Eyes Cody”. When they appear, Orange’s characters look nothing like their Hollywood avatars. They live in Oakland, ride bikes and drive postal vans. As if anticipating a reader who expects a book about mythical figures who commune only with trees and grass, the prologue scoffs: “Buildings, freeways, cars – are these not of the earth?”Various characters are heading to the Big Oakland Powwow, where there will be a dancing competition with a large cash prize. Each wishes for something different from the event. Orvil Red Feather aims to win, despite having a mediocre costume. Edwin Black wants to meet his real father. Blue works for the festival and the job is her chance to escape an abusive partner. Tony Loneman plans to steal the prize using a 3D printed gun, and the reader is conscious throughout of this threat of violence. Loneman’s gun brings to mind Chekhov’s rule that a gun in the first act of a play must surely go off by the end: the anticipation keeps the novel feeling tight and fast.The brilliance of the book lies in what Orange does with this tension. With the plot device of the powwow holding the book together, he has the freedom to tell many different stories in many different voices. We learn about ripping the fur from a live badger in order to create a medicine chest. We learn too about the gentrification of Oakland, the excitement of buying a drone, about encountering the man who once raped you. We learn that many Native American names are colours because they didn’t have last names before the settlers came: names were made up or mistranslated or forced on them. The word Indian was imposed. The use of “Native American Indian” by his white mother causes Edwin Black to cringe. He doesn’t know his tribe but he’s learned that on Facebook the going term is “Native”.The novel grants each character the gift of complexity. It is possible to love and to be selfish, to have a limp and to walk with a swagger. These people have been hurt by history but are capable of causing hurt too – either with a 3D printed gun or by slipping away from one’s family into the haze of drink.The theme of addiction runs throughout. For several characters this is to alcohol, but drugs, Pepsi and even the computer also offer an escape. Orange refuses the common conflation of being Native American with being an addict. Instead he describes the sorrow that drives each character to their inidual obsession. In the words of one, “Some of us got this feeling stuck inside, all the time, like we’ve done something wrong. Like we ourselves are something wrong … We drink alcohol because it helps us feel like we can be ourselves and not be afraid. But we punish ourselves with it.”The force that pushes against this wrongness is story. At times this comes in the form of AA confessions, at others it is the hope of writing a short story collection, or compiling video testimonials after the loss of a family member. The word “story” appears again and again, weaving through the different narratives. As Opal’s mother says, “You have to know that we should never not tell our stories.” The prologue describes how untold stories can become a wound, and how false stories hurt. Perhaps to tell your own story is an attempt to heal, at least a little.But many of the characters are confused about how to tell their story. Knowing what you aren’t is not the same as knowing what you are. The characters aren’t certain what it means to be Native American. Some, like Dene Oxedene, are mixed race. Blue was adopted and brought up outside the community. Edwin Black was raised by his single white mother and doesn’t feel “Native enough”. Thomas Frank is half Native and half white, and thinks: “You’re from a people who took and took and took and took. And from a people taken. You were both and neither.” For Thomas this split is manifest in his white legs and brown arms and he wonders “what they were doing together on the same body, in the same bathtub”.These characters are simultaneously Native American and teaching themselves to be Native American. Edwin Black takes Native American studies in college and goes hunting for his father. Thomas Frank immerses himself in the Indian drum circle. Blue feels white inside and so gets a job at the Indian Centre to find a way to belong. Orvil Red Feather conducts his own research. His grandmother is too busy to teach him, so “virtually everything Orvil learned about being Indian he learned virtually”. He watches hours and hours of powwow footage. He even goes to Urbandictionary to learn the word “Pretendian”. But his grandmother argues: “You’re Indian because you’re Indian because you’re Indian.”Eventually, Orvil puts this uncertainty into his powwow dance. In the changing room, surrounded by other men readying themselves for the dance, he realises all of them “needed to dress up to look Indian too”. Although he is still uncertain about his status, he decides that “to cry is to waste the feeling. He needs to dance with it. Crying is for when there’s nothing else to do.”There There itself is a kind of dance. Even in its tragic details, it is lyrical and playful, shaking and shimmering with energy. The novel dips into the tiniest personal details and sweeps across history. Orange, like Orvil, creates beauty out of tragedy. Yet the novel remains a warning about the desolation that results when you separate parents from their children and try to eradicate a people.• Rowan Hisayo Buchanan’s Harmless Like You is published by Sceptre.

A team of scientists will be watching these human guinea pigs in a simulated real-life environment with sensors, microphones and wearable technology to monitor their physical, mental and emotional responses to the environment or building design.When complete, the 25,000 sq ft Well Living Lab, the first scientific research centre in Asia to focus on the indoor environment, will feature a range of simulated homes and offices. The facility will make small variations to the environment – in lighting, air quality and noise levels, for example – and monitor how they affect workers’ health, happiness and productivity. The research findings will be used to change the way future buildings are designed.“More and more architects, interior designers and engineers are working together with scientists for healthy design, and thinking about how to make the space more like human beings’ natural life,” says Xue Ya, Asia president at Delos Living, part of the team behind the Well Living Lab.Planned experiments include controlling the light in offices using a series of different types of windows and imported “smart glass” panels around the building, to analyse which has the most impact on productivity. A rotating research centre can turn 360 degrees, with adjustable interior lamps changing the colour, temperature, brightness and light spectrum. Large buildups under the floor and ceilings will hide hundreds of biometric and environmental sensors to monitor and record experiments. Entrants to the building will need to pass through three layers of doors into a protected environment with triple glazing.Architect Ruben Bergambagt of Superimpose says the design needs “ultimate flexibility” to anticipate future experiments. “Sometimes the research will be residential-focused, or for offices, or participants will spend a few weeks living and working on site and being part of the research – they need to change the building configuration constantly,” he says. There is an existing Well Living Lab in Rochester, Minnesota, a collaboration between Delos and the Mayo Clinic that is only a quarter of the size of the Beijing site. Researchers there have used cognitive tests, wearable and environmental sensors, observation and ethnography in initial research, and an ongoing three-year project is looking at responses to artificial lighting that simulates natural light and its impact on stress, sleep, job satisfaction and productivity.  An initial research study, published last January, involved 18 workers monitored in a simulated open-plan office in the existing Well Living Lab. Over several weeks, lighting, temperature and sound levels were varied, and their impacts on health monitored. Experiments included making the office uncomfortably cold, adding high levels of noise, and taking away or adding daylight. The researchers quickly concluded that occupants strongly preferred daylight to electric light – but if electric lights were used, then certain types of blue-enriched lamps were found to improve workers’ sleep patterns, mood and alertness. Chinese developer Sino-Ocean, which is building the lab in Beijing as part of a wellness-themed industrial park, will use the findings to adjust the way they run and construct their buildings in China. All their new office buildings will be built to the International Well Building Institute’s (IWBI) Well standard, which sets performance requirements related to air, water, nourishment, light, fitness and comfort. An example of Well research informing design is the finding that workers are less productive if stationed more than 7.5 metres away from a window.Beijing is still regularly heavily polluted. In March this year sandstorms helped PM2.5 air pollution reach 238μgm3 WHO guidelines say anything above 25μgm3 is dangerous to human health. But despite its less-than-green reputation, China is already the biggest investor by far in green technology, investing more than double the amount the US does and five times more than Britain. A report from the US-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis in January concluded that China accounts for half of the world’s $2.2tn investment in energy efficiency, and is by far the largest force in global clean energy development.As part of its 13th five-year plan, Beijing has mandated at least half of new urban buildings must be green-certified by 2020. According to the IWBI, 220 of the world’s 871 Well-certified projects are in China. The country also ranks number one outside the US for projects certified by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (Leed) green building rating, home to 1,240 out of 6,657 Leed-certified projects globally.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bd8f5385876d0208cf56962a89f4aa02fd8955f/500_746_4889_2933/master/4889.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12732559913f9f5c3ec069416cabf9f3","title":"cleaners fair wages university in house working lives","story":"The latest in our new economics series looks at how one university’s decision to bring cleaning staff in-house changed working lives and transformed a community for the betterA queue was already forming by the time Isaac Oti turned up for work before dawn that May morning. He came back a couple of hours later and – “boom!” People were spilling out of Queen Mary college, past the gates, past the engineering faculty. They were standing out on the road three or four deep, almost reaching the tube station.“It was crazy.” Even 10 years later, Oti’s eyes shine at the memory. “CRAZY!”Those excited masses were not lining up for a house, the latest iPhone or a glimpse of Beyoncé. They were waiting for the chance to be a cleaner at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL).As senior supervisor of college cleaning, the roles were Oti’s to give. Yet what he mainly felt at that moment was not power, but panic. Summoning HR to help triage the queue, he set out table after table in front of the grand Queen’s Building. The original recruitment questions he had prepared would, if posed to everyone waiting, take days. They got chopped in half. Then he noticed that candidates who’d completed the interview would pass on the questions to family members farther back, so he had to keep inventing new ones.That biblical queue entered campus mythology. One Queen Mary staffer, Simon Butcher, says: “I’ve never seen anything like it before, or since.” And as myths do, it’s improved a little with time and telling. Today, some put the queue at a thousand, when the college’s original estimate of about 300 is astonishing enough.This is more than just a great story. The cleaners of QMUL are the living rebuttal of some of the most repugnant hypocrisies in Britain today – over who is entitled to what, over what kind of work matters, over who counts as part of a working community.What drove those hundreds of people to stand for hours that May morning was stuff you should take for granted: a wage large enough to live on, some job security, the right to paid holidays and to rest when sick without worrying whether you’ll be able to pay the rent. Yet 10 years on, the counterparts of Oti and his colleagues at other universities and companies are still fighting like mad to get those basics.Over the past few years, I have reported many of their stories for this newspaper. A grandmother doing three cleaning jobs each day, just to make ends meet. A security guard who works a 70-hour week for so little money that his family of five rent a shared house. And a mother, whose supervisor refused to adjust for her disabilities, and called her “bitch” and “whore”. After shifts, she’d walk down to the tube and go right up to the platform’s edge, half hoping to kill herself. All worked at the University of London, an institution that boasts “every member of staff is treated with dignity”.Universities are where the biggest battles over outsourcing rage, but they are hardly alone in doing it. Whitehall and Westminster offices are cleaned by outsourced workers so, probably, are your local hospital and school. And while not all outsourced positions are bad, one of the surest ways of driving down a service job’s pay and conditions is to contract it out.Consider two workers doing the same role, whether in social care or cleaning or catering. One works for the public sector the other a private company. Given that they are doing the same thing in the same environment there\u0026nbspshould be no difference in their terms and conditions. Right?None of this is coincidence. It’s widely accepted that when a low-paid service job, such as cleaning or portering, is contracted out to a company it drives up profits at the expense of workers.“Through outsourcing, university managers routinely allow low-paid workers to be treated disgustingly, in ways they would never tolerate for their own staff,” says Jason Moyer-Lee , general secretary of the Independent Workers of Great Britain (IWGB), a trade union leading some of the key fights for the rights of college facilities staff. “Yet when we raise these issues, the standard college answer is: ‘This is nothing to do with us take it up with the\u0026nbspcontractor’.”It took 11 years of campaigning by the Unison trade union and students for Soas University of London to agree to bring cleaners in-house, starting this autumn. Last summer, the London School of Economics agreed to do the same. Yet the IWGB is still battling Senate House, the administrative hub of the University of London, for better rights for facilities staff.All this makes the case of Queen Mary even more striking. Years ahead of rivals, it brought cleaners in-house and became the first university to pay a living wage. Activists pushed college managers – but, compared to the epic campaigns waged on other campuses, they did not have to push hard or long. Today, the college doesn’t just have living wage accreditation: it boasts about it on a big banner outside its offices.The stark contrast raises two big questions: how did the college make this shift? And what difference has it made?Queen Mary in the mid-2000s would not have been the place or time you picked for a workers’ revolt. Cleaners were employed through contractors and were not being organised by the campus union, Unison. Hardly anyone in the country knew what a living wage was, and most were still getting to grips with Gordon Brown’s newfangled minimum wage.Yet the college was blessed with academics raring to apply their research on workers’ self-organisation to their own backyard. Prime among them was geographer Jane Wills. When she looked at local hospitals, the banks on Canary Wharf, and her own college, certain things were uncomfortably obvious: “All the low-end jobs were being done by foreign-born workers and, if they were subcontracted, they weren’t getting enough to live on.”Queen Mary had two-hour cleaners, who came in between 6am and 8am every day – before continuing on to other jobs. Most were employed by KGB Cleaning (a name that presumably had not been focus-grouped), which gave them minimum wage, no sick pay, nothing towards a pension and no compassionate leave. Khalid Rouass, who has worked at the college since 2004, remembers: “If I went on holiday I wouldn’t get paid. One of the guys went on holiday, he came back for payment and got sacked.” (These and other allegations were put to KGB but it did not respond.)Without Wills, someone like Rouass would probably have gone on to another bad employer. But not only had she done early research on the living wage, the academic also knew a community activist group that would later find fame as Citizens UK (it was at one of their events that Gordon Brown delivered his best speech of the 2010 general election). She drafted them in to help and they began by collecting testimonies from KGB workers that comprised what came to be known as the “dirty dossier”.In the summer of 2005, the campaigners asked top Queen Mary managers for a meeting. When that was refused, they held a rally outside the college of 120 cleaners, students – and the then-local MP, all calling for a living wage. “The college heard about George Galloway turning up and overreacted,” recalls Wills. Their heavy security helped produce some useful headlines.Then came an appeal to college trustees’ better natures: a film featuring not just members of Queen Mary but a local Buddhist priest, a couple of vicars and an imam from the mosque down the road. “A broad church of really very terribly decent people,” laughs Wills. “All talking about the common good.”But the decisive moment came when campaigners got the college’s chief administrative officer, Dean Curtis, to come to their tiny office just a few minutes off campus. When he turned up, a handful of outsourced cleaners were all ready to talk to him.“What they told me was tantamount to abuse,” Curtis remembers. About their bosses shouting at them, about not being given adequate protection when cleaning science labs. “They were brave enough to tell me about it\u0026nbsp… if their employer knew that they were doing this, that would have been their last day of employment.”There was no shop steward, no grievance hearing. This was people talking plainly and painfully about their own experiences. It would become a key technique for Citizens UK, and it stirred Curtis.So disturbed was the boss that he angrily asked a Unison rep why they weren’t giving him a hard time on the cleaners’ behalf. “It’s where you’d expect an organised labour movement to be vocal, confrontational.” (The union says it worked closely on the campaign: “Unison has always stood up for all the employees it represents in higher education, irrespective of whether they’re directly employed by a university or by a private company that’s won an outsourced contract.”)The campaigners were only asking for higher pay, but Curtis had bigger plans. By bringing the cleaners back in-house, the college could save on the VAT it paid the outsourcing companies – and use the money to pay\u0026nbspthem more. The trustees and senior management were on board his biggest hurdle was cajoling junior managers who had got used to the easy life of another company managing everything for them. He remembers the\u0026nbspconversations.“It was: ‘Do you realise I’m going to have work hard?’‘Yes, that’s what you’re paid for.’”His decision announced in September 2006 took the workers by surprise. “There were tears everywhere,” remembers Matthew Bolton, today the incoming head of Citizens UK.Curtis’s technique could be used by other universities today, say experts.“For most businesses, VAT isn’t a real cost because they get it back from the taxman,” explains tax barrister Jolyon Maugham. “But if colleges outsource they get hit by a double whammy, of paying the outsourcer’s profit margin and VAT on everything, including all staff costs. If you’re a college and you stop outsourcing you might reasonably expect to cut your costs by around a third, representing VAT on the costs of outsourcing and the outsourcing company’s profit margin.”A year after staff were moved in-house, Wills collected the figures on how costs had changed. They looked like this: In the year up to the end of July 2007, Queen Mary paid KGB £2,119,000 for cleaning. From August 2008, for the first full year that Queen Mary cleaners were in-house: £2,197,000.“It boils down to whether they want an easier life. Yes, it means more management and time, but you get better outcomes.” He moved last year to be acting vice-chancellor at University of East London, which outsources a lot of its services and plans to shake things up over the summer.At other colleges, outsourced cleaners sometimes call themselves “invisibles” to describe how they aren’t seen or heard by directly employed staff. But at Queen Mary, every passerby has a hello for Oti and his cleaning team. Academia is famously scruffy, a place where peacocks are encountered only in zoology textbooks, yet when I met Oti two weeks ago he wore a pair of chocolate suede monk straps. Once he’d been a two-hour cleaner at Gatwick, he told me: “Now I’m on the same terms and conditions as the principal of the college.” There was a soft pride at his own journey.Cleaners could now get NVQs through the college, or brush up their English. “Occupational health, counselling: we can use all of it.” And his colleagues had grasped their opportunities: cleaners had become administrators, security guards supervisors. Some had been promoted to managers.“When you’re a cleaner, it’s doesn’t mean you’re dirt,” he said. “We consider these people cleaners, but they’re working towards something.”• Aditya Chakrabortty is a  columnist and senior economics commentator"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e4e8ceeb92db028b688b17dade412956a713d78/0_21_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0eaf37ffd28d27529c05f4d380572a88","title":"what does childbirth feel like google","story":"Twenty-four hours into my labour I could be found wearing a pair of XXL hi-vis trousers – the kind worn by overweight construction workers as they repave motorways – walking up and down a small, rat-scuttled stretch of the River Lea, rubbing my nipples like kindling and muttering to my partner in the steady, driving rain.Six hours into my labour I was eating a chicken bagel on a bouncing birthing ball, watching Dr No with my cousin 48 hours into my labour, I woke up, light-headed and wet, my waters broken 51 hours into my labour, I was kneeling in a birthing pool in Homerton hospital, holding a beautiful, howling prune in my arms.Like cheese sandwiches, the Milibands and snowflakes, no two labours are ever the same. The same mother with the same father in the same room will have utterly different experiences with each child, let alone the differences from woman to woman. You may have a caesarian, you may have an epidural, you may deliver in the bathroom, you may be sent home from the hospital you may tear, you may take no pain relief, you may be induced, you may deliver early, you may need interventions you may mistake the early signs, you may not.But remember this: any labour that results in a healthy mother and a healthy baby is a good labour. Any woman who goes through any form of childbirth is a hero. The blood, the courage, the self-sacrifice, the stamina, the body-shuddering pressure, the fear, the gore: no wonder men had to invent war to soothe their phenomenal sense of inadequacy. Childbirth is an act of bravery, strength and endurance no man will ever know.When I was pregnant, people seemed eager to tell me horror stories about the women they’d known who had suffered greatly. Those experiences are real and valid and belong to the women who experienced them. But if you are pregnant, or thinking of getting pregnant while reading this, may I simply say: it isn’t always like that. It can be very different.Let us begin with contractions, for that is probably how things will start. My friend, the author Amy Liptrot, described contractions as “an earthquake going through your body”. It is, for me, a perfect description. I was expecting nuclear period pains – what I got, as my mother did before me, was a feeling like an HGV reversing into my lower back. They were seriously heavy weather and I remember thinking, two days in, as I hung on to the windowsill, in the dark, my partner rubbing my back, my face against the glass, “I am never doing this ever again.”They were unrelenting – a near-total block on thought, a thick black noise filling every inch of my body, an unshareable weight, a central focus for all the gravity in the universe. But they weren’t exactly painful – just overwhelming and exhausting. Because they kept on coming.Of course, people do experience incredible pain and if you are induced, your contractions will feel entirely different. I mention mine simply to point out that contractions, like all elements of labour, may not be what you’re expecting. If you possibly can, do not resist them, for they are productive, necessary and they do pass. I found this balloon metaphor quite helpful.My waters finally broke after two days and two nights of contractions. I felt suddenly light, radiant, made of something like glass – everything was bright and sharp but also shining. As I walked through the hospital I felt each breath rushing in like something white and icy.I had been sent home twice that previous night, hunkered over like an animal, a towel over my head to block out the world, heaving, groaning, sweating, impatient, throbbing. I had endured contractions lying on a bed, under a screaming fluorescent bulb, two monitor belts across my belly. I was not ready yet. I had to go home. I have never been so disappointed.When I returned that morning, light-headed, my pyjamas wet, unable to sit, walking like sand, the midwife examined me to discover that I was fully dilated. I have never felt such relief.“Nell, can you feel anything in your bottom?” the beautiful, clear-faced midwife asked me as I lay naked on a mattress beside the window. Did she mean the contractions? This pulsating heaving pressure in my lower back? “Do you mean my pooing bum?” I asked, bleary-eyed. She did. I felt nothing until, dragging my way into the toilet for a wee, I suddenly felt the urge. I walked out of the toilet, into my birthing room, naked, sweat-soaked, eyes half closed. “My bum,” I announced, “is now involved.”Pushing out a baby, the final stage, was – and please believe me when I say this – wonderful. After two days of contractions – a feeling that I was getting nowhere, the almost unbearable wait punctuated by the unrelenting crashing waves of pressure – to realise that I was finally going to evacuate was brilliant. Suddenly, I didn’t care where I was, who was with me, what happened. I could have pushed that baby out in the middle of a Lidl car park.As I knelt in the pool, gripping my partner by the fists, following the breathing directed by the midwife, I knew somehow what it took. This pushing was familiar, innate. Not unlike a shit, of course, but somehow phenomenal in its scale. I could actually feel the limbs, the corners, the structure of my baby moving down through my body.My limbs were merely ribbons hanging off this giant, pulsating tube. I was a volcano, a child, a rigid blank in the centre of a moving world. I felt a pop in my vulva. I felt with grim acceptance that I had torn my vagina into a doily I had been too eager and ripped it apart. “That was just the seal around the baby’s head,” my angel midwife said, from somewhere behind my arse.I pushed. I felt a head and then it slipped away. I asked my partner if the baby was out. He managed, somehow, to keep a straight face. It was not. Then, finally, out it came, in two enormous heaves that turned my face puce: a Francis Bacon painting of hot purple contortion so furious I had to dip it in the water around my body for relief.Childbirth feels like everything to everyone. Wolves gnawing at your entrails, blue medical hairnets, a thundering ocean, white noise, sandwiches in plastic packets, teeth-chattering nerves, the ripping apart of your pelvis like tectonic plates, the click and drip of machinery, lightning down your spine, the pale blank hum of a hospital light, the onion sweat of animals, panic, darkness, exhaustion, a mist that becomes hail, leaving your body, believing in your body, a beleaguered body, a body pulled from your body.There is no good labour and no bad labour. Anyone who births a child, by whatever means, deserves our admiration and our support. They should feel proud that’s what childbirth should feel like.

Parched and crisped by weeks of dry summer heat, the heather is a burnt brown-to-burgundy, the moorland grass yellowed. The bracken looks all right – still a deep pea-green (it takes a lot to bother bracken) – but finger-wide cracks have opened in the colourless peat of the footpath. It’s early morning the day hasn’t yet been fully cranked up, and the broken sky is a messy palette of blues and greys. A loose flock of a dozen meadow pipits forages for caterpillars.Rombalds Moor covers the hump of upland separating Airedale in the south from Wharfedale in the north. Walking the sun-baked flanks of the Wharfe catchment, we’d found that Barden Moor and Barden Fell had been closed due to the risk of fire. Those are grouse moors, and so is this: every so often I frighten a bird up out of the bents, and I can hear them burping and clucking around the feeding stations set up by the gamekeepers.A dry peatland is a manmade phenomenon. “Peatland habitats form over thousands of years,” Dr Tim Thom, peat programme manager at Yorkshire Wildlife Trust, tells me. “As a society, we’ve spent decades drying them out.”A healthy peatland should be wet, a cool, dark blanket of deep peat and saturated sphagnum moss. Breeding waders like it that way so do raptors, lizards, cottongrasses and carnivorous sundew plants. But years of “reclamation” – ditch-digging and burning, mainly – mean that it’s now a threatened habitat in the UK. Some peatlands amount to historical ruins: landscapes that were millennia in the making (a metre of peat represents a thousand years of steady mulching) reduced to bare dirt and ragged peat-hags. A few, thanks to backbreaking work by conservation and restoration groups, like the Yorkshire Peat Partnership, thrive. Most are somewhere in between – their fate still hangs in the balance.From Ilkley Moor, to the north, a curlew whinnies. A short-eared owl flaps heavily along the near horizon.

In The Equalizer 2, Antoine Fuqua’s follow-up to his 2014 reboot of the 80s TV staple that is somehow not titled “The Sequelizer”, that expression gets an amendment. The only thing capable of stopping five bad guys with guns is a Denzel with a gun, and probably a couple of knives, too, just to be sure.Much like the recent exhuming of the more overtly reactionary Death Wish pictures, the return of Denzel Washington’s avenging angel Robert McCall plays to a distinctly American, distinctly male power fantasy. A former marine, retired CIA black op and recent widower, McCall is getting long in the tooth. (Never the type to put too fine a point on things, Fuqua has the avowed bookworm tackling Marcel Proust’s In Search of Lost Time as the final entry on his lifetime reading list.) He fills his days by driving for Lyft, patiently listening to a doddering old-timer in his neighborhood and trying to keep local boy Miles (Moonlight star Ashton Sanders) out of the gang life. He’s trying to leave behind a better world than the one he entered, repainting a graffitied wall of his building and urging Miles not to use cuss words.But greater evils than the occasional S-word lurk among the high-rises of Boston’s lower-income neighborhoods, and accordingly, McCall must take more extreme measures in his quest to purge the streets of wrongdoers. It starts when some skeevy financial types dump a roughed-up female intern in his car, and McCall goes up to their penthouse to crack some skulls after safely depositing her at the hospital. He takes it upon himself to pick up the police’s slack by going vigilante with principle, dropping pseudo-slick one-liners about good manners while he dispatches the no-goodniks who fall through the cracks.Last time around, he was helping out streetwise teen prostitute Chloë Grace Moretz, and now, he’s unraveling a convoluted, uninteresting conspiracy threatening his pals Dave and Susan (Pedro Pascal and Melissa Leo, respectively). In either case, the mentality undergirding his actions remains the same. He’s a naked expression of the middle-aged man’s desire to remain relevant and in command of his immediate surroundings. Washington is now 63 years old, and McCall acts even older – though he never tells anyone to pull their sagging pants up, you can tell he is at all times thinking it – but he has no trouble putting the smackdown on men two or three decades his junior. Like the cowboys who took the law into their own hands before him, a tradition evoked by a final shot mimicking John Ford’s indelible end to The Searchers, he acts as a compromised society’s self-appointed moral . We want him on that wall, we need him on that wall, etc.He claims to pursue justice, and because Washington has had 30-odd years to perfect his onscreen charisma, the audience may very well believe him. (That Washington is charming enough to disguise McCall’s clear streak of Travis Bickle-level sociopathy ranks as this production’s greatest asset.) In actuality, he’s in pursuit of something far nastier, cheaper and faster – revenge. The Equalizer pictures operate under a false moral imperative, using the mission of cleaning up the streets as a cover for the same pat hyper-stylized, near-pornographic brutality. The audience at this critic’s screening howled with approval at intimately photographed knifings, shootings, and one instance in which a man is flung from a great height on to some sharp rocks. The film would have us believe that that reaction isn’t what McCall would’ve wanted, but it’s clear that this has been Fuqua’s game all along.The script makes repeated mention of what it means to be a man, as McCall often disses his enemies by impugning their masculinity. A real man would never lay hands on a woman, he rules, a real man has honor or a moral code. Little does Fuqua realize that his hero embodies the spirit of this particular variety of manhood more completely than he could have intended. For there is nothing more typical of a middle-aged American man’s fragile ego than the need to regain command over a world in the process of leaving him behind. The film ends with young Miles applying himself by putting his artistic talents to use on a comic book immortalizing the Equalizer, and in doing so, completing the dream of geriatric action (geriaction?) cinema: to remain vital, respected and capable forever. When a child feels this impulse to be big and strong, we get the inspirational superhero pictures currently flooding multiplexes. When a grown adult feels this way, however, the result is sad – pathetic, even – and in the worst cases, dangerous."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a14fbd1a6a29cdadbf97a13d768944b55a74f5b/0_0_4134_2757/master/4134.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ba6af41d0fbe90088ca20693da3253fa 1440w","title":"the world cup colour chart a photographic journey","story":"Looking back at the highs and lows of Russia 2018 via a rainbow of imagery, from Gareth Southgate to France lifting the trophy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a5456f684d9442293a3c38504e7136f9e8b68c3/0_278_4997_2998/master/4997.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e11a85ac768a5169635627dc2041fbd2","title":"wembley stadium sale plans fa sport england grassroots","story":"• Sport England expresses conditional support• World Cup strengthens FA’s resolve to sellThe Football Association’s proposed sale of Wembley stadium has become more likely to gain the necessary approvals of public bodies after the grant-giving agency Sport England expressed conditional support. In written evidence submitted to the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee before a hearing on Wednesday about the Wembley sale, Sport England stated that it sees benefits in the FA’s plan to invest the projected £600m proceeds in grassroots facilities, as long as Wembley’s sporting status is protected.Sport England suggests that if the necessary safeguards are in place it will give consent and provide grants to boost the FA’s investment. “Provided appropriate protections can be agreed it appears that there is an opportunity to coinvest new funds strategically, for the benefit of football, and the wider community, at the grassroots or community level,” it states.The original funding agreement stipulated that the new Wembley had to remain a national home of sport, with priority given to sporting events rather than concerts and other entertainment which could make money for the stadium. A list of sporting “flagship events” which have to be given precedence was incorporated into the agreement which, Sport England emphasises in its submission to the committee, will have to remain protected “as far as practicable”.The flagship events include England men’s and women’s football internationals, FA Cup semi-finals and the men’s and women’s FA Cup final, the FA Vase and Trophy finals and Community Shield, the EFL and National League play-off finals, the EFL Cup and trophy finals and the rugby league Challenge Cup final.Consent to a sale is also required from the Greater London Authority, whose predecessor the London Development Agency awarded a £21m grant towards the Wembley project, and from the government. The sports minister, Tracey Crouch, is due to give evidence to the committee.The England team’s surprising advance to the World Cup semi-final, and the widespread admiration for the way the team played and was managed by Gareth Southgate, has strengthened the FA’s resolve to sell Wembley. The FA set out in detail the generally poor quality of publicly owned football facilities across England, which have suffered severely from the Conservative government’s budget cuts to local authorities.The FA’s surveys have found that only one in three pitches in England is “of adequate quality” and that poor facilities are always “the number one issue” for grassroots clubs and players. From the £600m gross proceeds of selling Wembley, the FA is pledging that more than £2bn would be invested over the next 20 years, to support the national strategy for improving facilities and also increase the numbers of players, coaches, referees, volunteers and administrators.“A significant increase in investment in football at the community level … could bring significant benefits to people and communities across England,” it states, “reaching some of the most under-represented groups in sport and physical activity as a whole.”Sport England’s consent to a sale of Wembley will also be conditional on being satisfied that Khan or any other buyer, and any subsequent buyer, is “an appropriate person to own the national stadium” and has a sound business plan. The consultants Grant Thornton have been appointed to assess the purchase. The London borough of Brent wants any new owner to be committed to the ongoing regeneration of the area around Wembley.The DCMS committee will also hear evidence from the TV analyst and former England full-back Gary Neville, and Katrina Law, co-chair of the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters’ Trust."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3ab9d4cb5548bd868a610b745915511872e56d5/0_1_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=375ba495c18246eea24de4760560c4c2","title":"princess diana landmine legacy angola huambo","story":"21 years on, the Angolan province Diana visited is within months of being declared clear of unexploded ordnance.

Two people have been referred to the police. But with this initial investigation concluded, Britain faces a difficult period of soul searching over what to do about this evidence of extensive wrongdoing.A democracy is only as strong as the elections that set its course. If they can be bought or subverted, then confidence in democracy and the legitimacy of the governments it installs, seeps away.But astonishingly, the details that have been gradually revealed, of illegal activity by both the official Vote Leave and the unofficial Leave.EU campaigns in the run-up to the Brexit vote, appear to have no immediate consequences.Most British elections are guaranteed by law. If evidence of serious cheating is uncovered they can be scrutinised and overturned in an “election court”, overseen by high court judges. However, because the Brexit referendum was only an advisory vote there are no legal channels to challenge the result. Only parliament can investigate the result, declare it void or demand a re-run.Nor have the powerful politicians who fronted the flawed Vote Leave campaign faced direct censure, even as the country is rocked by the tumultuous fallout from a vote that is now known to be flawed.The Electoral Commission’s report established that BeLeave was operating as an arm of Vote Leave, which had won official status and the taxpayer money that entailed, partly by recruiting Conservative party luminaries. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, was co-chair and the former foreign minister Boris Johnson was a figurehead for the campaign. But the report names only Darren Grimes, an inexperienced student at the time of the poll, and the previously obscure Vote Leave official David Halsall.Both Gove and Johnson had once been quick to dismiss critics of the Vote Leave campaign. In March Johnson described the Observer’s report on the campaign group’s coordination with BeLeave as “ludicrous” and said Vote Leave won “fair and square”. Yet both men have been conspicuously silent since the Election Commission report was released – along with other senior government or Conservative figures who sat on the Vote Leave committee. These include Liam Fox, Iain Duncan Smith, the new Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, and the former international development secretary Priti Patel.It is unclear whether the British media will try to hold Gove, Johnson and other senior Vote Leave figures to account over the cheating where the Electoral Commission was not able to do so. The record so far has not been encouraging.Editors at the BBC must be questioning – or should now be questioning – why they gave the Vote Leave CEO, Matthew Elliott, virtually free rein to attack the watchdog and present his version of the report days before its official release. His account differed significantly from the published report.Too often over the two years since the referendum any efforts to question or investigate the Brexit campaigns have been dismissed as undemocratic sabotage, the work of bitter losers.In fact, exposing fraud is a profoundly democratic enterprise, an act of commitment to ensuring that votes are respected. And yet journalists, lawyers and researchers digging into these questions began with very little political support. The Electoral Commission’s findings on Vote Leave – after it was forced to reopen an investigation that previously cleared the campaign group – have been a vindication of their work.Yet this was only one fight, over one aspect of a campaign still shadowed by other serious questions about the legality of campaigns and funding, and several ongoing investigations. The original source of more than £400,000 donated to the Democratic Unionist party’s Brexit campaign remains obscure, and the government has fought efforts to uncover details about the cash, officially provided by a small thinktank.The Electoral Commission has been looking into whether the Brexit donor Arron Banks’s Better for the Country was the “true source of donations” to the leave campaigns. The Sunday Times has also reported that the National Crime Agency has been investigating Banks’s alleged Russian links. Separately, the Information Commissioner’s Office is conducting an inquiry into potential data sharing between groups, including Brexit campaigns. The politan police have an inquiry into Liz Bilney, the CEO of Leave.EU, after the Electoral Commission ruled that Banks’s campaign had exceeded its spending limits.The Electoral Commission has also put out an urgent plea for stronger laws and greater resources to protect British democracy.Only months before the UK is due to leave the EU, with huge political and economic upheaval, it is reasonable to expect that part of the response to this report must focus on whether the decision to do so was legitimate.Yet, in some ways, to argue about whether illegal spending by Vote Leave, Leave.EU – or possibly others – was enough to swing this hard-fought referendum is to sidestep more profound concerns about the implications of those actions.The people who masterminded the Vote Leave campaign currently face little more than a rap over the knuckles for cheating. But their actions have been described by Gavin Millar QC as being of a “scale and seriousness” not known in the modern era, and which has potentially reshaped Britain’s future.The barrister and election expert Adam Wagner spelled it out: “What is the point of having strict rules over elections and referendums if there are no consequences for them being broken?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1da9aac9553d98c6a71999cc50f1e4aabded512f/0_131_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3227442c2fd018a85b6bea5a5efdab6a","title":"dairy products may become luxuries after uk leaves eu","story":"Reliance on EU butter, cheese and yoghurt means sharp price rises, says milk producer ArlaEveryday dairy products such as butter, yoghurt and cheese could become luxury items in Britain after Brexit, with price rises being caused by the slightest delay in the journey from farm to table, a report by the London School of Economics finds.The LSE research, commissioned by the company behind Lurpak, Anchor and Arla brands, also found that speciality cheeses could become scarce after Brexit, with escalating costs whatever the outcome of the exit negotiations.Ash Amirahmadi, the UK managing director of Arla Foods, said: “Our dependence on imported dairy products means that disruption to the supply chain will have a big impact. Most likely we would see shortages of products and a sharp rise in prices, turning everyday staples like butter, yoghurts, cheese and infant formula, into occasional luxuries. Speciality cheeses, where there are currently limited options for production, may become very scarce.”The LSE report comes a year to the day after the government was warned that it was “sleepwalking” into a post-Brexit future of insecure, unsafe and increasingly expensive food supplies.Britain’s food production deficit has been put in the spotlight after repeated warnings that the country needs to rely less on imports to feed the population.Britain does not produce enough milk to keep up with demand, creating a dependency on the EU, including on dairy-surplus countries such as Ireland, Germany, France, Belgium and Denmark for everyday items such as cheddar cheese and butter.If the UK crashes out of the EU with no deal and defaults to World Trading Organisation rules, prices will almost certainly rise as dairy products, along with meat, attract high tariffs. Even if a deal were struck and there were no tariffs, imports would face costly delays at Dover, the report says. LSE estimates that every seven-minute delay at a port such as Dover will add a minimum of £11 extra per container because of extra labour costs.In addition, rules of origin certificates could add €48 (£45), with veterinary controls costing £50.60 per consignment, the LSE finds. The research suggested that small cheese suppliers in France and Italy could find their products uncompetitive in British shops, generating scarcities and, in turn, price rises.Amirahmadi said it was important to be clear that Brexit might bring opportunities to expand the dairy industry in the UK, boosting the country’s declining food security levels. However, he warned that this would take time.“Brexit might bring opportunities to expand the UK industry in the long-term, but in the short- and medium-term we cannot just switch milk production on and off. Increasing the UK’s milk pool and building the infrastructure for us to be self-sufficient in dairy will take years,” he said. Arla is the largest dairy company in the country with a turnover of £2.6bn and supplies the big supermarket chains including Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and Asda with branded and own-label products. It is a pan-European cooperative with production facilities in 11 countries supplied by its 11,200 dairy farmers, 2,400 of which are British.Commenting on the LSE report, Amirahmadi suggested that farmers who owned the Arla dairy cooperative already offered the consumer the best possible price.“There’s no margin to play with here in the value chain,” he said. “Any disruption means that if we don’t get the practicalities of Brexit right we will face a choice between shortages, extra costs that will inevitably have to be passed on to the consumer, or undermining the world-class standards we have worked so hard to achieve.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2943d8bd6d280053d9adef2f5ba10ad50f656cd4/0_180_2825_1695/master/2825.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1c556c9a591ac8c0bd7952c761d40de","title":"kate hoey under pressure from labour after siding with tories","story":"MP for Vauxhall angers constituency party who call for party whip to be withdrawnKate Hoey is facing demands to stand down as a Labour MP from members of her constituency party after defying the whip to vote with the Conservatives in Tuesday’s crucial Commons vote.Opponents in her south London seat of Vauxhall have prepared a motion of censure that demands that Jeremy Corbyn withdraws the party whip and stops her from standing again as an MP.At least one ward and one Momentum meeting have already passed the censure motion, which is expected to be put before a constituency meeting next Thursday.The motion reads: “As Labour members who campaigned for Kate Hoey at the last general election despite many of us disagreeing with her about Brexit, we are appalled at the way in which she is demonstrating that her personal views take priority over representing her constituents and our party by voting to enable this rotten, inept government to stay in office.”It demands that “the leader of the Labour party suspend Kate Hoey from the parliamentary Labour party and remove the whip” and that the party’s ruling body, the NEC, should “declare Kate Hoey ineligible for re-selection as a parliamentary candidate.”Hoey said the censure motion was “no surprise”. “Over my 29 years I have been censured numerous times. It’s my constituents that really matter and, hard as it might be for  readers to understand, they include many who voted remain and aren’t obsessed with Brexit.”Hoey’s decision to vote against the party and the motion was discussed on Tuesday night at a Momentum meeting in the Bread and Roses pub in Clapham, south London. A statement from Vauxhall Momentum, which was circulated among local activists, urged members to support a motion of censure that will be put to Vauxhall Labour party’s general committee on 26 July. This is a meeting at which all members can attend but only delegates can vote. One local party activist said that Hoey’s decision to vote with the Tories was being seen as a missed chance missed to bring down Theresa May. Last month, the same general committee passed a motion critical of Hoey which asked the party’s general secretary, Jennie Formby, to meet to discuss the possibility of setting up an early trigger ballot. Hoey’s political demise was predicted before the last general election because of her pro-Brexit stance in an overwhelmingly remain constituency. She became a target of vitriol from some remainers after appearing on a fishing boat with Nigel Farage. Defying predictions, she increased her majority by more than 7,500 votes, which she attributed to young voters enthused by Corbyn’s campaign.

The fresh haul of natural satellites brings the total number of Jovian moons to 79, more than are known to circle any other planet in our cosmic neighbourhood.Nine of the new moons belong to an outer group that orbit Jupiter in retrograde, meaning they travel in the opposite direction to the planet’s spin. They are thought to be the remnants of larger parent bodies that were broken apart in collisions with asteroids, comets and other moons. Each takes about two years to circle the planet.Two more of the moons are in a group that circle much closer to the planet in prograde orbits which travel in the same direction as Jupiter’s spin. Most likely to be pieces of a once larger moon that was broken up in orbit, they take nearly a year to complete a lap around Jupiter. Which direction the moons swing around the planet depends on how they were first captured by Jupiter’s gravitational field.Astronomers describe the twelfth new Jovian moon as an “oddball”. Less than a kilometre wide, the tiny body circles Jupiter on a prograde orbit but at a distance that means it crosses the path of other moons hurtling towards it. Scientists have named the new moon Valetudo after the Roman god Jupiter’s great-granddaughter, the goddess of health and hygiene. But given the impending violence, it may be more than coincidence that Vale Tudo, which translates from Portuguese as “anything goes”, is an early form of full-contact mixed martial arts. “Valetudo is like driving down the highway on the wrong side of the road,” said Sheppard. “It is moving prograde while all the other objects at a similar distance from Jupiter are moving retrograde. Thus head-on collisions are likely.”Sheppard, whose report appears in the International Astronomical Union Minor Planet Electronic Circular, suspects that Valetudo is the final remnant of a once much larger moon that has been ground to dust by collisions in the past. Which raises the question of how long the tiny moon has left. “Collisions don’t happen all that frequently, every billion years or so,” said Sheppard. “If one did happen, we would be able to detect it from Earth, but it is unlikely to happen anytime soon.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2eefeb997b8b82b1d28e1e6ca545a6dd4edce534/0_56_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78adb1c26bc633fa6eb0e27f52c58720","title":"disability claimants owed 340m after dwp blunder say mps","story":"‘Indifferent’ department tried to shift the blame and took six years to correct errorA cross-party group of MPs has criticised the Department for Work and Pensions’ “culture of indifference” after it took six years to correct a major error which left chronically-ill and disabled benefit claimants thousands of pounds out of pocket.An estimated 70,000 claimants were underpaid by between £5,000 and £20,000 between 2011 and 2016 because the DWP failed to ensure they received the correct amounts when moving them from incapacity benefit on to the employment and support allowance (ESA).The cost of fixing the error, which a public accounts committee’s (PAC) report said stemmed from a string of avoidable management failures, will cost the DWP at least £340m in back payments to claimants and £14m in administrative costs.As well as losing out on thousands of pounds through underpayments, the DWP’s failure to check claimants’ entitlements meant some were also denied their rights to help with dentistry costs, as well as free school meals and free medical prescriptions.The report criticised the DWP for rushing into the transfer without taking legal advice or making basic checks, brushing aside evidence that people were being underpaid, and ignoring warnings from its own policy advisors that it should pause and fix the process before proceeding.Even after it became formally aware of its error in 2014, the department failed to act, initially attempting to pass the mistake off as being the fault of claimants. After years of “inertia” it began to put in place a repayment plan in 2017, and then only after receiving advice that it had a legal responsibility to act. The report concluded the DWP’s lack of urgency in taking six years to start to address the error indicated “a culture of indifference” towards people being underpaid.Meg Hillier MP, the chair of the PAC, said the episode pointed to “weakness at the highest levels” of DWP management: “Thousands of people have not received money essential for living costs because of government’s blinkered and wholly inept handling of ESA.”The ESA failure was overseen by the Tory former secretary of state for work and pensions Iain Duncan Smith, who was in post for all but the last few months of the period covered by the report. The current secretary of state, Esther McVey, was a DWP minister between 2013 and 2015.Although it accepted it had got the process wrong and apologised, the DWP has insisted it will not pay compensation to affected claimants, and will limit back payments to 2014, a cut-off point which would deny claimants up to £150m in lost benefits. That decision is being challenged through the courts.The report argued the DWP should pay compensation to claimants, as well as back payments. “There is clearly much more to be done to right this wrong,” it stated.The department told MPs it accepted it should better understand its legal obligations. The report drily noted: “Our view is that this continues to underplay its moral obligation to act promptly and comprehensively to make good its mistakes when they occur.”The report said the DWP must learn from the mistakes it made during the ESA transfer in order to not repeat them when its starts a major programme of transferring 3 million claimants from existing benefits onto universal credit from July 2019. Universal credit (UC) is the supposed flagship reform of the benefits system, rolling together six benefits (including unemployment and benefits, and tax credits) into one, online-only system. The theoretical aim, for which there was general support across the political spectrum, was to simplify the system and increase the incentives for people to move off benefits into work.The project was legislated for in 2011 under the auspices of its most vocal champion, Iain Duncan Smith. The plan was to roll it out by 2017. However, a series of\u0026nbspmanagement failures, expensive\u0026nbspIT blunders and design faults\u0026nbsp means it is six years behind schedule and rollout will not be complete until 2023.The original design set out\u0026nbsp a\u0026nbspminimum 42-day wait for a first payment\u0026nbspto claimants when they moved to UC (in practice this is often up to 60 days). After sustained pressure, the government announced in the autumn 2017 budget that the wait would be reduced to 35 days from February 2018. This will partially mitigate the impact on many claimants of having no income for six weeks. The wait has led to\u0026nbsprent arrears and evictions, hunger (food banks in UC areas report\u0026nbspnotable increases in referrals), use of expensive credit and mental distress.\u0026nbspMinisters have expanded the availability of hardship loans (now repayable over a year) to help new claimants while they wait for payment. Housing benefit will now continue for an extra two weeks after the start of a UC claim. However, critics say the five-week wait is still too long and want it reduced to two or three weeks.Plenty.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMultibillion-pound cuts to work allowances\u0026nbspimposed by the former chancellor George Osborne mean UC is far less generous than originally envisaged. According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, about 2.5m low-income working households will be more than £1,000 a year worse off when they move to UC, reducing work incentives. Landlords are worried that the level of rent arrears accrued by tenants on UC could lead to a rise in evictions. It\u0027s also not very user-friendly: claimants complain the system is complex, unreliable and difficult to manage, particularly if you have no internet access. And there is concern that UC cannot deliver key promises: a critical study found it does not deliver savings, cannot prove it gets more people into work, and has plunged vulnerable claimants into hardship.It added the department must act urgently to “address a management culture which does not proactively and systematically act on intelligence from its frontline and fully address mistakes when they first occurred”.The national association of welfare rights advisers wrote to the the DWP in 2014 to alert them to what its frontline advisors had realised was a “systematic” error. It told MPs the DWP could be “unconstructive” when confronted with legitimate concerns by outside organisations. The DWPs “abysmal” communications with claimants exacerbated the scale and impact of the error, the report noted. Letters to claimants were often “incomprehensible,” and the department’s most senior official, Peter Schofield, admitted to MPs that even he did not understand some of the letters that went out.The DWP error related to claimants who were awarded contributions-based ESA, when they may also have been entitled to income-related ESA. The forms sent to claimants did not make it clear they could be better off if they were eligible for the latter award. As a result they may have missed out on premium payments.ESA is an unemployment benefit paid to people with limited capability to work because of disability or illness. About 2.4 million Britons receive ESA, and in 2016-17 the total expenditure was £15bn.A DWP spokesperson said: “We take the issue of underpayments very seriously and have actively taken steps to put this right as quickly as possible, to ensure people get the support they are entitled to. “We have recruited 400 extra staff and have already started making payments – over £40m so far. We have continued to provide regular updates to both PAC and the House in regards to the progress of these repayments, and will continue in this stead.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23951dd96d76422534a19473540db17de8a175af/0_254_4492_2696/master/4492.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e92c518598cbed68a5676720a71a59aa","title":"england india third one day international match report","story":"England thrashed India by eight wickets with 33 balls to spare, a victory far more straightforward than anyone could have expected and one of the most rewarding since the last World Cup. This win secured the series 2-1 against the No 2 side in the world in the sort of conditions India would have welcomed: a dry surface offering some turn to their spin bowlers.England restricted India to 256 for eight, a target which is deemed to be a doddle in this era. But this match had the feel of a final, which made it all the more intriguing, and at the start there was more tension around as a consequence. That all vanished as rapidly as some of the Indian supporters in the last hour as Joe Root and Eoin Morgan calmly cruised to their goal in an unbroken partnership of 186. Root hit his 13th ODI century from the last ball of the match to become England’s most prolific ODI centurion, surpassing Marcus Trescothick.Perhaps the tension was only really evident in the India side as, for the second match in succession, England’s wrist-spinner Adil Rashid proved to be the most effective of the three on view – that must be some kind of record against India. England’s white‑ball specialist took three wickets, including the vital one of Virat Kohli with a delivery he will treasure for decades. More than anyone Rashid was responsible for the shackling of the India batsmen even though there were more economical bowlers on his side – both David Willey and Mark Wood were bang on target at the beginning and end of the innings.Rashid was the man of the match and seems to be benefiting from concentrating solely on the white‑ball game he is so much more confident in this format than in Test cricket. The soundest strategy may be to let him be until the 2019 World Cup is over since he has become such a crucial weapon for Morgan. Thereafter it might be a good idea to invite Rashid to reconsider bowling with a red ball.India’s innings began with unaccustomed wariness mainly because Wood and Willey found not only a good length but also a hint of swing. After 18 balls Rohit Sharma holed out off Willey for two. The introduction of Liam Plunkett hastened the run rate with his first two overs yielding 21 runs, mostly to silky cover drives by Shikhar Dhawan, but a moment of brilliance from Ben Stokes ended a dangerous partnership alongside India’s captain. Kohli clipped the ball to square leg but was not keen on a single. Dhawan was, however, and he advanced down the pitch a fraction too far. Stokes hurled the ball at the stumps at the bowler’s end and he hit them. There was no great celebration from the England side as the speed of Stokes’s throw deceived everyone.Kohli’s departure was even more influential. A fizzing leg‑break from Rashid pitched on middle and leg and passed the outside edge of the bat to clip the off bail. An aghast Kohli, who looked almost as astonished as Mike Gatting all those years ago against Shane Warne at Old Trafford, hesitated before departing. There followed a few nervous moments for England as the third umpire confirmed that the ball had broken the stumps before the intervention of Jos Buttler’s gloves, an outcome that would have relieved England’s wicketkeeper since he had earlier spilled a tough chance off Moeen Ali when Kohli was on 23. In the same over Suresh Raina was satisfyingly pouched at leg slip by Root – the satisfaction coming from the fact that England had stationed a leg slip in the first place.MS Dhoni tried to restore the innings but in the last two games he has looked like a man swimming against the tide. Shardul Thakur was the solitary batsman to cause any trouble when he hit the only two sixes of the innings in the penultimate over.England’s pursuit began rapidly. Jonny Bairstow had hit seven boundaries in nine deliveries before gently clipping the ball to midwicket. James Vince on his return to England colours settled easily, produced some graceful strokes and was then run out for an infuriating 27. He might have set off earlier for a sharp single he was perhaps unlucky that Dhoni redirected the ball on to the stumps so deftly.Then with barely a scare Root, the man of the series, and Morgan combined with purpose. On 69 Root was stumped off a no-ball from Yuzvendra Chahal on 85 Morgan was dropped at mid-on. Otherwise they coped admirably against the Indian spinners, who had so tormented them earlier in this series and the T20s and who were getting the ball to turn on such an arid surface. England had recognised a problem and resolved it, which is what good sides do. “Those spinners did for us again in the middle overs,” said one of the captains after the game and remarkably that was Kohli. It was Morgan who simply observed that his spinners were “brilliant”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45525a427c9804c3ec0edcd77d65e93a0af2641c/0_148_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68f61e043e8d8a9b73e7083a5e674598","title":"la course womens tour de france remains way off","story":"The lack of a press conference for winner Annemiek van Vleuten shows the tacked-on status the race still holds despite positive noises from UCI president David LappartientDespite the cliff‑hanging nature of her victory there was no press conference for La Course winner Annemiek van Vleuten. Instead, with the Tour de France’s token nod to women’s racing done and dusted, the riders were quickly ushered off stage and the focus switched to the start line of the men’s Tour de France, across the valleys of the Haute-Savoie.This was the fifth edition of La Course and by general consensus easily the best race yet. But for the second year running, the Tour organisation had merely bolted the women’s one-day race on to the men’s Tour with a truncated version of a key Alpine stage.Despite the profile of La Course and the women’s Tour of Italy, a revitalised women’s Tour de France remains a long way off. Highlighting that, a group of French female cyclists, Des Elles au velo, are riding the route of the men’s Tour, a day ahead of the men’s race, in a bid to promote women’s stage racing and specifically a women’s Tour de France. Meanwhile the pressure on ASO, promoter of the men’s Tour, to rejuvenate the women’s Tour de France that it once organised, the long-lost Tour Feminin, is increasing.“I want to see a women’s Tour de France within the term of my presidency,” David Lappartient, the UCI president, said after his election last autumn. “La Course is nice, but ASO can do more and I have put pressure on them to achieve this.”Women’s racing, he says, has a bright future but adds that some women competing at World Tour level are earning less than €10,000 a year from racing. “That’s very bad, totally unacceptable. But you can see the passion around the women’s Tour of Britain, which is now one of the world’s top races for women, and the interest in La Course.“We have a lot of women’s teams but the base needs to be stronger and we are discussing with women’s teams how to improve the situation. I think cycling can be one of the top three women’s sports.”It is estimated that the top earners in women’s racing are paid around €200,000 a year, with the minimum wage for a full-time pro as low as €30,000. Even then, there remain some riders racing for free, while others work part-time or continue their education.However with a clutch of major sponsors – including Lizzie Deignan’s newly unveiled backer Trek – now able to pay riders to compete full-time, the number of riders able to focus their energies fully on training and racing, rather than stacking shelves to finance competing or studying to safeguard their futures, is growing.Yann Le Moenner, chief executive of the Tour promoter ASO, said that cycling will soon “definitely deserve a dedicated women’s Tour de France, with a lot of media attention”.Rachel Hedderman, who as Rachel Heal raced in the Olympics for Team GB but is now sports director for the UnitedHealthcare women’s team, is cautiously optimistic. “Women’s cycling in general seems to be on the up at the moment,” she said. “It’s a lot more talked about so I’m optimistic that ASO will run with it and start growing La Course. You’d hope there’d be a longer stage race, but if we start with a shorter race with a few stages, including a mountain stage, then good.“Once media coverage increases, then the investment will come from sponsors. The media coverage will drive the value to the sponsors. People aren’t doing it out of charity: it has to be a viable business. But the money that it takes to run a top tier women’s team is significantly less than a World Tour men’s team.”But even with the media circus that follows the men’s Tour on site, Le Moenner said a Tour Feminin would have to be a standalone event. “Logistically, it’s just not possible to do a women’s Tour running alongside the men’s Tour,” he said. “We need to work on the best solution to showcase women’s cycling, and the sooner the better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/842b1c02c91deb6e7ae678f3b835ceba1eed684b/111_90_3126_1876/master/3126.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b87d9d908fe614a6f040198d4cd0206","title":"tim brennan faugheen betfair","story":"• Tim Brennan denies passing information to his brother• Faugheen was declared non-runner in 2016 Champion HurdleThe Tim Brennan hearing has concluded with defence barristers insisting there were “plenty of other alternative sources” who could have prompted Betfair users to start laying Faugheen for the 2016 Champion Hurdle.Brennan – who has long been principal vet to Faugheen’s trainer, Willie Mullins – denies passing inside information to his brother, Michael, who is one of two punters known to have bet heavily against Faugheen two days before the horse was declared a non-runner.The British Horseracing Authority relies on the coincidence of timing between Michael Brennan laying the horse and phone contact with Tim. The BHA’s barrister, Philip Evans QC, pointed to the fact that Tim sent Michael a text message just minutes after news eventually broke of Faugheen’s injury and suggested it may have said: “Well, there you are, I told you so,” though the actual contents of the text are not known.But Edward Fitzgerald QC, who presented closing arguments for Brennan, said Michael Brennan could have received negative information about Faugheen from several other sources. “Lots of people knew there was a problem,” he said.He read out an internal BHA email which said the Irish Turf Club had “confidence” that another inidual connected to the Mullins yard was involved in passing information. The BHA could find no evidence against that person. “The Turf Club is far nearer to the scene of events than we are here and they know the characters,” Fitzgerald added.The panel heard thatanyone on Mullins’s staff might have noticed Faugheen had been on the “easy list” for a fortnight, and that members of Mullins’s staff also rode out sometimes at a nearby yard owned by Michael Brennan. Fitzgerald alluded to a possible source of information who “drinks in the same pub” as Mullins’s staff. He named Ted Hegarty, a bookmaker, as the other person who had layed Faugheen at about the same time as Michael Brennan using a similar amount of money. A BHA investigation found no connection between Hegarty and Tim Brennan. Fitzgerald said the evidence did not even show that the Brennan brothers spoke on the day Michael Brennan started betting against Faugheen, “far less that they shared confidential information”.Mullins’s evidence is a problem for the BHA, as he insisted Faugheen showed no sign of a problem in the hours immediately after being ridden on 15 February 2016, the day Brennan layed him. If that were accepted there would be no inside information for Tim Brennan to pass. Evans said he accepted Mullins’s honesty but queried whether his recollection was reliable and said the betting evidence “makes absolutely no sense” if the horse was not obviously lame that day.Tim Brennan gave consistent evidence during lengthy cross-examination, denying he had ever passed inside information to anyone. He said confidentiality is “the cornerstone of a vet or doctor’s career. You make an oath and swear to honour that. It’s part of our integrity, it’s vitally important.”It emerged his young daughter was taken to hospital for an MRI scan on the morning of 15 February. The Brennans were also arranging care for Tim’s sick mother, who died two months later. In that context, his lawyers suggested, he would be mostunlikely to be thinking about making an illicit profit from betting exchanges that day and that any contact with family members would have been concerned with the health of other family members rather than horses.A verdict is expected this week.Tips by Chris Cook."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff8c3753262aba4a78b2c1aaa69cbf3ef65d0a45/0_233_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ed9e508b8f77583a65289281cb7563b","title":"tour de france stage 10","story":"Julien Alaphilippe prolonged French hangovers from World Cup celebrations by becoming the first home stage winner in this year’s Tour de France, after a long‑range attack in the mountains of the Haute Savoie led to a solo win in Le Grand-Bornand.But the Frenchman’s success came at the expense of Geraint Thomas, whose hopes of slipping into the yellow jersey were dashed after the race leader, Greg Van Avermaet, infiltrated the same breakaway earlier in the stage and held on to actually extend his overall lead.Speaking after the stage, Thomas did his best to hide his disappointment. “We were expecting that,” he said. “Van Avermaet did it the last time he had the jersey. It would have been nice to take it but it’s the Tour de France – nothing comes easy. But the team rode well, that was the main thing.”Behind Alaphilippe and Van Avermaet, Sky adopted their now familiar catenaccio style, controlling the peloton with a steady tempo on every climb and discouraging any further attacks. “There were some steep climbs and we were expecting it to really kick off somewhere on the last two,” Thomas said. “But that never really materialised. I guess there was a bit of a headwind on that last climb. With two big Alpine days to come everyone was probably saving it a bit – or on the limit. I don’t know.”It was a relatively uneventful day for Chris Froome too, apart from a puncture on the dirt section of the Plateau des Glieres climb. “It was a little bit of wacky races going on there,” Froome said. “I had a puncture, got a spare wheel from a teammate only to find out that was flat as well. So it was a little bit of a comedy of errors going on. But thankfully it was still far from the finish, so the race wasn’t too crazy and I was able to get back in.”Only a late foray by Dan Martin, winner of the stage to Mur de Bretagne, livened up the final ascent, the Col de la Colombière. “It was a block headwind so every bit of common sense said ‘don’t attack’, but our plan from the start was if guys are five or 10 seconds off the back at the top of the climb then it could be a minute by the finish line,” he said.“For the sake of doing a little sprint, making it hard, anybody put in the red could have been dropped,” said the Irishman, whose burst towards the final summit was enough to distance the Colombian Rigoberto Urán, second to Froome in Paris in 2017 and now almost four minutes behind the defending champion.Martin admitted, though, that the first Alpine stage had been something of a stalemate. “That’s what happens when you get three hard days in a row,” he said, referring to the forthcoming ski station finishes at La Rosiere and Alpe d’Huez. “The next two days are going to be brutal and also, this was the stage after the rest day but the wearing-down process has begun. There’s going to be a lot more guys attacking tomorrow.”If Thomas sounded disappointed not to pull on the maillot jaune, Dave Brailsford laughed off comments from Bradley Wiggins that his management style was “isive” and “self-serving”. The Team Sky principal said: “I’ve been called a lot worse. On my Richter scale, that’s not bad. I can take that. Over the years, we’ve always tried to build teams where the top guys are very close together and they have got their own ambitions.”But Brailsford also hinted that there had been lessons learned from the Froome‑Wiggins feud of July 2012, when both riders seemed intent on winning the Tour. “As you get older and wiser,” he said, “and you learn from your mistakes you know how to manage these situations, and openness is the key.You learn to talk to everybody together, be clear and frank with everybody, and these guys know the score.”But he was insistent there would be no infighting during this year’s Tour. “It’s a totally different dynamic from what we’ve had in the past – Chris and Geraint have grown up together, they have known each other a long time, they are 32 and 33 years old, they’re not young lads and they are pretty easy to manage, to be honest. Four of the riders are over 30, two are 28 and when you tot up how many Grand Tours they have done between them there is an enormous amount of experience on that bus,” Brailsford said.Alaphilippe, who also won a stage of the 2014 Tour de l’Avenir on similar roads that included the gravel section of the Plateau des Glières, also claimed the King of the Mountains jersey. It was the Quickstep team’s third stage win of the 2018 Tour and their 50th victory of the season.“It was a big objective to take a stage in the Tour de France and a really proud moment for me to win,” Alaphilippe said. “I was able to enjoy it a bit on the downhill and realise what I’d done. It was an incredible feeling in the last kilometre.”Stage 10: 1 J Alaphilippe (Fr) Quick-Step Floors 4hr 25min 27sec\u0026nbsp2\u0026nbspI Izagirre (Sp) Bahrain-Merida +1:34 3 R Taaramae (Est) Direct Energie +1:40 4\u0026nbspG Van Avermaet (Bel) BMC +1:44 5 S Pauwels (Bel) Dimension Data\u0026nbspst 6\u0026nbspL\u0026nbspCalmejane\u0026nbsp(Fr) Direct Energie +2:24 7\u0026nbspD Martin (Ire) Emirates +3:23 8\u0026nbspP\u0026nbspRoglic (Svn) LottoNL-Jumbo 9\u0026nbspD\u0026nbspGaudu (Fr) Groupama-FDJ 10\u0026nbspG\u0026nbspThomas (GB) Sky all stKing of the mountains:\u0026nbsp1 J Alaphilippe (Fr) Quick-Step Floors 41pts\u0026nbsp2\u0026nbspR Taaramae (Est) Direct Energie 28"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a17b097821f4c393cea4f954a973a11d64c846c/0_329_4482_2688/master/4482.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=738db8753daa40a01ca762c2faf632c1","title":"a monster calls review old vic london","story":"Old Vic, LondonSally Cookson delivers an exhilarating production of Patrick Ness’s story about a lonely boy coping with grief, bullying and a monster in a yew treeSometimes it is good to go to the theatre in a state of innocence. I have neither read the prize-winning novel by Patrick Ness on which this show is based, nor seen the film adaptation. But I have caught the recent work of the play’s director, Sally Cookson, including her versions of Jane Eyre and La Strada, and this exhilarating production has the physical inventiveness and ensemble cohesion that are her trademarks. The story is a mix of moral fable and antique myth. Its hero is a lonely 13-year-old, Conor, who is bullied at school and coping with his mother dying of cancer. Resisting adult authority, including a disciplinarian gran and a dad briefly visiting from the US, Conor turns to a dream figure: a gigantic monster who sprouts from a yew tree in the local churchyard and offers to tell Conor three tales if the boy will, in return, tell him the truth. The strength of the story, inspired by an idea from Siobhan Dowd, is that it blends adolescent reality with fairytale fantasy. Since the monster’s message concerns emotional honesty, I confess I couldn’t share the snuffles and sobs around me at the story’s end. To borrow a phrase of Keats, I felt it clearly had “a palpable design upon us”. What really impressed me was the wit and elegance of Cookson’s staging and Michael Vale’s design. The visual concept is based on strands of rope that are twisted and tangled to form the gnarled branches of a yew tree, out of which Stuart Goodwin’s monster appears. With his bare torso, necklet of berries and commanding presence, Goodwin evokes folkloristic memories of Herne the Hunter and the Green Man. Rope is also used to suggest everything from a wicked queen’s crown to a car’s steering wheel. It is Cookson’s gift for creating a world out of simple props and actors’ bodies that gives the show its drive. Aside from rope, chairs are the other key ingredient used to convey both schoolroom regimentation and the wild disorder Conor creates in his detested gran’s home. Matthew Tennyson’s physical presence as Conor also gives the story its focus. He captures the vulnerability and solitude of a victimised 13-year-old: his eyes often seem to be fixed on the middle distance, as if reluctant to engage with other people. Yet Tennyson also displays a teenage stroppiness to the moralising monster, and the boy’s complex mixture of guilt and love towards his ailing mother. Praise is also due to Selina Cadell as Conor’s bossy gran, Marianne Oldham as his stoical mum and John Leader as a tormenting bully. Watching the show, I couldn’t help wondering if Ness’s title was a deliberate echo of An Inspector Calls. As in JB Priestley’s play, a mysterious outsider arrives to press home a moral point. But there is nothing formulaic about the monster’s stories, which invest Grimm-style fables with a Brechtian irony. Whereas Cookson’s production of Jane Eyre felt like a reductive account of a great novel, here there is an ideal balance between means and ends. The story, the acting and the music of Benji and Will Bower, at one point echoing Khachaturian, are all used to remind us that, whether children or adults, we all have to face the fact of mortality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/198611027af51cfa313a599dfa63dd0d26f26531/0_18_3024_1815/master/3024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43995a5e3260315610f382acfbd6a5d5","title":"tesla elon musk thailand diver pedo","story":"Tesla CEO called immature after attacking Vernon Unsworth, who rescued trapped childrenTesla investors have demanded an apology from CEO Elon Musk after he lashed out at a British cave er who rescued children in Thailand.Musk’s posts on Twitter sparked backlash from shareholders and Silicon Valley analysts, who called his behavior immature and an impediment to the car company’s success.The embattled CEO came under fire over the weekend after he baselessly called the er, Vernon Unsworth, a “pedo” on Twitter and doubled down on the insult before eventually deleting the posts. Musk had flown to Thailand and offered to assist in the rescue mission of 12 boys and their coach from a flooded cave by providing a submarine, but leaders of the operation declined his help. Unsworth, who was instrumental in the successful rescue, later said Musk’s effort was a “PR stunt”, prompting the Silicon Valley billionaire to say he would make a video proving his “mini-sub” would have worked, adding: “Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.” The er, who was still at the cave site assisting with clean-up, told the  he was “astonished and very angry” and considering legal action. Musk and Tesla have gone silent since he deleted the tweets, ignoring repeated requests for comment since Sunday. Some shareholders, however, are speaking up.James Anderson, a partner at Baillie Gifford, Tesla’s fourth-largest shareholder, told the  in an email on Tuesday that the company saw “the end of carbon as essential” but, was “frustrated that the real steps towards this are being overshadowed and undermined by this saga”.Anderson said he agreed with some of Musk’s past remarks calling out critical analysts, “but this is different. We are in contact with the company and we are hopeful that it is being taken with due seriousness.” He said he would like to see “peace, quiet and execution” at the electric car company. Musk has faced increasing scrutiny in recent months over his bizarre tirades on Twitter and his aggressive attacks on journalists, regulators and other critics. The scandals come amid continuing complaints about workplace safety and a struggle to meet production goals. If Musk’s behavior did not change, “it could have a dramatic negative impact on the company”, said Gene Munster, head of research at Loup Ventures, a venture capital firm. “It has to start with an apology.”In addition to losing the confidence of investors, Munster said, “the irony here is that their brand is word of mouth.” The scandals “could negatively impact demand and access to capital”. Loup Ventures published an open letter to Musk on behalf of investors, saying the comments to Unsworth “crossed the line” and calling for an apology.“Over the last 6 months, there have been too many examples of concerning behavior that is shaking investor confidence,” the letter said.Jing Zhao, who recently filed a shareholder proposal to remove Musk as chairman of the Tesla board and install an independent director, said the CEO was being unprofessional and that it was “not his business” to travel to Thailand and try to directly solve the rescue challenges. Zhao said he believed Musk originally had “good intentions”, but that “humanitarian rescues … are professional tasks so we should trust others with local community connections.“He should focus on his profession,” Zhao said, adding that if Musk wanted to help these kinds of causes, he should have a separate charity organization. Zhao also said that this scandal offered further evidence that the company needed an independent chair: “He is not mature enough.”Tesla’s board members did not respond to requests for comment. Solar Shed, a British renewable-energy installer, said it would “no longer promote” Tesla-branded products and called on other solar firms to do the same, the Washington Post reported on Monday. The company’s managing director tweeted:“All it takes is a public apology Mr Musk and i will reverse our decision.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd18ed569c8365d749fef6d7f74ba4c4c2fa6a25/0_316_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55c9134baf138b438ee202822e689603","title":"facebook data gathered by cambridge analytica accessed from russia says mp damian collins","story":"Damian Collins questions whether Russians used knowledge to run US election adsFacebook data gathered by Cambridge Analytica was accessed from Russia, an MP has said.Damian Collins, who is leading a parliamentary inquiry into fake news, told CNN that the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) had found evidence that files were accessed from Russia and other countries.He said: “I think what we want to know now is who were those people and what access did they have, and were they actually able to take some of that data themselves and use it for whatever things they wanted.” He added: “So is it possible, indirectly, that the Russians learned from Cambridge Analytica, and used that knowledge to run ads in America during the presidential election as well?” Cambridge Analytica (CA) folded as a company this year, shortly after being suspended by Facebook following allegations it had amassed data on millions of voters from their profiles and misused it. A University of Cambridge professor, Aleksandr Kogan, had passed on information to CA and others after launching a Facebook app called thisisyourdigitallife.It is alleged the information was used to target US voters during Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential election campaign, while a whistleblower has claimed the firm had links to pro-Brexit campaigners. Kogan, who has also worked at St Petersburg State University, denied handing Facebook data to any Russian entity, telling CNN: “I don’t know what could have happened to the data once I handed it over to Cambridge Analytica so it is difficult for me to speculate.” He said that it could be down to something “innocuous”, such as a representative of CA’s parent company, SCL Elections, remotely accessing the server to see the files while in Russia. Last week the ICO announced it proposed to bring criminal action against SCL Elections, and revealed that the total number of users to have had their data harvested stood at an estimated 87 million. It also said it intended to fine Facebook a maximum £500,000 for two breaches of the Data Protection Act 1998."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84f795da9ef641ad60fc0ee3a85d0116ff8fda44/88_0_945_567/master/945.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5e95606df315c14bf030d58787106ea","title":"whale watching cornwall marine wildlife cruise","story":"Spotting whales, porpoises, dolphins, and a rare ocean sunfish, underlines why a UK coastal cruise is a revelation – and conservation so vitalMore UK marine trips“Ahoy there!” came the cry, jolting us out of sun-induced drowsiness as the propeller roared to life and the boat headed towards the horizon. “Whale ahead!”We’d been scanning flat expanses of azure water off southern Cornwall for a couple of hours in sweltering heat that had seemingly sent the sea to sleep, but now our patience had been rewarded. From the flybridge, keen-eyed AK Wildlife Cruises operator Keith Leeves had spotted a dark shape briefly breaking the surface some distance away.“It’s a minke whale, and they can stay down for up to half an hour, so everyone keep your eyes peeled,” he said, easing back on the throttle as we narrowed the gap.Actually, it wasn’t long before the whale came up for air again, curving through the calm water straight ahead. “There she blows!” Captain Keith exclaimed as its black head appeared like a surfacing submarine, followed by its rounded back, gleaming in the sunshine, and distinctive dorsal fin at the rear. Then the vast bulk slipped sedately down into the blue.This was my first sighting of a minke whale, the smallest and most common baleen (filter feedinf) whale found around UK shores, and judging by the shared smiles among the 10 other passengers, everyone aboard was equally thrilled.With engine idling, all eyes scanned the surface of the sea in silence, guessing where it might appear next. We were soon treated to another view as the rounded back rolled like a dark wave behind us, feeding among teeming masses of tiny fish that set the sea sparkling and fizzing like soda water. Minke whales are known to be inquisitive, and this five-metre-long inidual seemed unperturbed by our presence, rising nearby at a leisurely pace more than half a dozen times. It was breathtaking – for both whale and onlookers.“Wasn’t that wonderful?” Keith said, his voice brimming with enthusiasm as we motored on. “You never know what surprises are in store out here.”The experienced naturalist has been operating AK Wildlife Cruises out of Falmouth since 2002, running year-round excursions of four hours or more on his fully equipped boat Free Spirit. He shares valuable records of sightings with marine conservation organisations. Last year he logged 5,764 dolphins, porpoises and whales of seven species – and 2018 looks set to be “just as phenomenal”.The Cornish peninsula is one of the best places in Britain to see a wealth of marine life all year round. In spring and summer, plankton blooms attract basking sharks that cruise close to the surface, cavernous mouths agape as they sieve the briny soup. Common and bottlenose dolphins are frequently sighted and other cetaceans include harbour porpoise and the scarcer Risso’s dolphin. Incredibly, endangered leatherback turtles, which can grow to more than two metres in length, are sometimes encountered during the summer.Wildlife is just as plentiful in the colder months, with a host of ocean-going seabirds present. The enormous fin whale, second in size only to the blue whale, has been spotted in winter, along with thousand-strong super-pods of common dolphins. Other possibilities include white-beaked dolphin, humpback whale – which has been sighted during April – and Atlantic bluefin tuna.“I adore what I do, being a passionate naturalist first and foremost,” said Keith. “I’m always excited about every trip, whatever the weather, as it offers the chance to share in the ersity of magical wildlife we are lucky to get here.”Keith said warm conditions following the cold winter meant plankton blooms and shoaling fish fry were in sync with the arrival of predators, resulting in greater numbers of feeding basking sharks and minke whales compared with last year.“The current heatwave has seen plenty of demand for trips, coupled with the impact of the BBC’s Blue Planet series and other wildlife programmes, as more people have become aware of the life in our seas and want to experience it first-hand,” he added.Our close encounter with a minke whale was not the only special sighting on the trip. A blue shark was briefly spotted feeding at the surface, and one of the UK’s strangest summer visitors also put in an appearance: the ocean sunfish. Sea temperature rises are believed to be behind increased sightings of this large semi-tropical rarity around the UK coast, particularly in the south and west, and a tall fin flopping from side to side gave its position away just in front of the boat.Not only does the ocean sunfish look bizarre, with its circular shape and long fins like oars at the rear but it also behaves eccentrically, lolling on one side as if more interested in sunbathing than swimming. It was a wildlife wonder to round off a trip that not only revealed some of the natural riches around the coastline but also showed why our seas are so worth protecting.• A four-hour trip with AK Wildlife Cruises costs £56 adults, £46 children (up to 16)Charlie Elder is author of Few And Far Between (Bloomsbury, £7.69) and While Flocks Last (Transworld, £8.46).

Its contestants may be in for a tough 10 daysSome shows don’t deserve reboots. Some shows create such an almighty crater of notoriety that nobody in their right mind would want to touch them again. Minipops will never be revived, for example. Naked Jungle will never be revived. The Farm? Well, that’s a slightly different story.The Farm was a Channel 5 reality show in which a number of celebrities learned how to operate a working farm. But you don’t remember The Farm for the premise. No, you remember it for being the show where David Beckham’s alleged lover Rebecca Loos was tasked with masturbating a pig to orgasm.The incident eclipsed everything else that happened on The Farm. Nobody remembers Vanilla Ice arguing with Paul Daniels until the magician quit in a strop. Nobody remembers Peta getting upset over footage of a duck eating a croissant. No, The Farm was the Rebecca Loos pig show and nothing else. So impossible was it to crawl out from under the shadow of porcine arousal, in fact, that The Farm was axed a year later. “We’re not going to do The Farm again, no,” said the channel’s director of programmes, Dan Chambers, at the time. But guess what? This summer, a clutch of no-mark faces will appear on 5Star’s Celebs on the Farm. For 10 days, eight celebrities – including Louie Spence, a Gogglebox, Lorraine Chase and two Towies – will slip on their wellies and muck out various types of animal dung.Channel 5 has been keen – extremely keen – to downplay any similarities between The Farm and Celebs on the Farm. Because The Farm was a show about celebrities working on a farm, whereas Celebs on the Farm is a show about celebrities working on a farm, so it is completely different.Maybe a minuscule format tweak will work wonders. What is Love Island, after all, except a honed and toned remake of Celebrity Love Island that has been retuned for millennials? Perhaps Celebs on the Farm will achieve the same feat. Perhaps it will break free of its inauspicious origins and become the must-watch TV show of the summer.With this in mind, Celebs on the Farm – which, really and truly, is basically a programme about people you have never heard of doing tedious chores – needs to do something major if it is going to stand out against the competition. Given that people only remember The Farm for one moment, that can only mean one thing.That’s right: I am suggesting that, for Celebs on the Farm to succeed, it needs to be nothing but wall-to-wall animal stimulation. This is what the people want. We live in 2018. People have a near-infinite choice of programming, so the only way for Celebs on the Farm to win is by racing to the bottom. It should swing for the fences. It should be torn from our screens for breaching obscenity laws after a single episode.Either that or they could just not make it in the first place. That might be the better option, actually."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Stolen credit card details used to pay for flights, toys, hotels, clothes, jewelleryV\u0026oacutet\u0026aacuteil 100 committee travels to present portrait of revolutionary to House of CommonsFears that industrial relations bodies could otherwise be swamped by Garda complaintsCoveney to brief Cabinet on recruitment and other preparations for hard BrexitReforms to coroners legislation will strengthen and modernise current lawMinister for Social Protection seeks to address loopholes in current legislationVaradkar may ask councillors to facilitate only \u0026lsquotruly Independent\u0026rsquo candidatesLow Pay Commission expected to recommend 25c rise in report set for MinisterAuditors criticise process of placing staff in acting-up roles and regularisation methodsHSE internal report says medical education grants were not always value for moneyJim Warny: Knowing lives of boys of similar age to his son were at stake made differenceGovernment hopes release of State lands to build homes will drive down cost of housingIncident occurred during raid carried out by Emergency Response Unit in DublinVisitors staying in cottage hear fishermen\u0026rsquos cries for help after lengthy period in waterChild was pronounced dead at Crumlin Childrens HospitalHarris: \u0026rsquoMen loving men,women loving women no less a family than mine\u0026rsquoTransparency of online political advertising should be regulated, group saysFamily and friends of Laura Barry carry coffin to sportswoman\u0026rsquos final resting placeTaoiseach says \u0026lsquonew departure\u0026rsquo in Irish education will drive regional development"},{"url":null,"title":"inside the ryanair flight that made an emergency landing","story":"  July 14, 2018People seen bleeding from ears after Dublin flight to Croatia makes emergency landing   July 14, 2018Croatia-bound flight in emergency landing   July 16, 2018Airline says \u0026lsquosmall number\u0026rsquo of passengers treated as a precaution after the incident "},{"url":null,"title":"it s a huge find megalithic passage tomb discovered in co meath","story":"  July 16, 2018Archaeologists uncover burial chambers on historic Br\u0026uacute na B\u0026oacuteinne heritage site "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3568386.1531856496!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit varadkar steps up plans for no deal exit due to turmoil in westminster","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar: because of “turmoil in Westminster”, the Government will step up plans for a “no-deal scenario”. Photograph:  Gareth Chaney CollinsThere is growing alarm in Dublin and Brussels that the British government is stepping back from, or will be unable to carry out soft Brexit positions in its White Paper, raising the prospect of a disorderly exit from the EU next year.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Tuesday that because of “political instability in London” and “turmoil in Westminster”, the Government here would step up plans for a “no-deal scenario”.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney will brief the Cabinet on Wednesday at its meeting in Derrynane, Co Kerry, about preparations for Brexit, including the recruitment of hundreds of customs officers and other measures at ports and airports.Following votes in Westminster which hard Brexiteers said killed off Theresa May’s White Paper plans to stay close to the EU after Brexit, Mr Varadkar said the Irish Government “can’t make an assumption that the Withdrawal Agreement will get through Westminster”.“It’s not evident or not obvious that the government in Britain has a majority for any form of Brexit, quite frankly,” Mr Varadkar said.The Irish backstop is the last major issue outstanding to be agreed between the British government and the EU negotiators at the talks on a Withdrawal Agreement, which reconvened in Brussels this week, according to several people familiar with the issues.However, at a negotiating session in Brussels on Monday, which focused on the Border issue, there was little evidence of any move in the British position.One Brussels source said it “wasn’t the most constructive day on Ireland” and that the British approach had not changed since the publication of the White Paper in London.The EU side believes there was little sign of any new instructions from London for the British negotiators which might lead to a breakthrough in the talks.While Brussels and Dublin issued a cautious welcome to Ms May’s White Paper last week, they have made clear to the British government that a legally enforceable backstop – guaranteeing single market and customs rules for Northern Ireland in the event of no agreement between the EU and UK – must be included as part of an Irish protocol in the Withdrawal Agreement.Privately, officials in Dublin and Brussels worry the British are “backsliding” on the White Paper commitments under pressure from Brexiteers in the House of Commons.“The more it feels like the UK are backsliding, the more entrenched the EU will become,” said one source. “If prior commitments are detachable, then the negotiation process is fundamentally flawed.”In the latest in a series of knife-edge votes in Westminster, Ms May on Tuesday night escaped defeat by just six votes on an amendment that would have kept Britain in a customs union with the EU in the absence of another arrangement to keep trade frictionless.But the government suffered a surprise defeat when 12 pro-European Conservative rebels helped to pass an amendment to keep Britain in the European medicines regulatory network.The votes came at the end of a heated day at Westminster as pro-European Conservatives sought to exact revenge on the government for caving in to Brexiteer demands on Monday. The government negotiated openly with the rebels on the floor of the House of Commons, with treasury minister George Holingbery offering to introduce a version of the customs union amendment in the Lords if the Commons version was withdrawn.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

But the government suffered a surprise defeat when 12 pro-European Conservative rebels helped pass an amendment to keep Britain in the European medicines regulatory network.The votes came at the end of a heated day at Westminster as pro-European Conservatives sought to exact revenge on the government for caving in to Brexiteer demands on Monday. The government negotiated openly with the rebels on the floor of the House of Commons, with treasury minister George Hollingbery offering to introduce a version of the customs union amendment in the Lords if the Commons version was withdrawn.Former education secretary Nicky Morgan made clear that the rebels backing the amendment were partly motivated by anger at Conservative Brexiteers’ efforts to wreck the prime minister’s Chequers plan.“The prime minister did the right thing by putting on the table a workable, practical proposal, captured at Chequers, which could be negotiated with the EU. Members of these benches chose to try to scupper that agreement and those proposals yesterday. Some of us tried to stop them. Sadly we failed,” she said.“We give the prime minister space for those negotiations. But it is very clear that in this House there is a majority for a customs union to safeguard business and jobs and the financial interests of our constituents in the future.”In the end, 12 Conservative rebels backed the amendment but four Labour MPs and one MP currently suspended by Labour voted with the government.\u0026nbspThe amendment on the European medicines regulatory network was tabled by Phillip Lee, who resigned as a justice minister last month in protest against the government’s Brexit policy.“This is vital because that is how we get our people and our NHS the medicines they need. It is also important for our pharmaceutical sector. The European medicines regulatory network partnership makes the process of accessing life-saving new medicines and moving medicines quick and easy. If we leave that partnership, the NHS would get ground-breaking new drugs like those for cancer, dementia and diabetes long after other parts of the world,” he said.Dr Lee’s amendment was passed by 305 votes to 301, with 12 Conservatives rebelling against the government to join the opposition in backing it.A government spokesperson said the amendment went beyond the commitment in last week’s Brexit White Paper to participate in the European Medicines Agency and suggested it would seek to amend it in the Lords.“As set out in the White Paper, the UK is seeking participation in the European Medicines Agency. We would look to be an active participant and this would involve making an appropriate financial contribution. We will now reflect on this amendment and seek to revisit in the Lords,” the spokesperson said.As Conservative MPs reported unrest among party activists over the Chequers proposal, the prime minister spent much of Tuesday meeting representatives from Conservative associations to brief them on her plans. On Wednesday she will face questions in the House of Commons before attending a meeting of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

A fan will also pull air around corners, as in our home.“The overall goal is to pull the warm air out while drawing cool air in once the outdoor temperature drops below the indoor temperature. Fans use hardly any power compared to AC.”  Mr Lebo added that while pointing the fan outside the window may seem counterintuitive to some, it is a lot more effective than the standard method.“The standard way simply pushes warm air around the room but we perceive it as cooling because moving air feels cooler than still air,” he says.“My technique of forced cross ventilation actually cools indoor air down by drawing in air cooled for free by nature that is just outside from late afternoon onward.”It could be time to turn that fan around He added: “Just make sure the bedroom windows are the ones with the air entering! The outward facing fan must be in the far end of the dwelling.”The UK enjoyed the hottest day of the year on Tuesday as temperatures peaked at 30.6C (87F), with the heatwave showing no signs of abating.Disabled comedian Tanyalee Davis \u0026#39humiliated\u0026#39 by train staff rejects apologyJeremy Corbyn called an \u0026#39anti-Semite and a racist\u0026#39 by former Labour minister Margaret HodgeLong-lost cache of British explorer discovered buried in Australian outback by former F1 driverComment: At a certain stage in a person’s life, driving becomes a licence to killComment: The Japanese may say no to intercourse, but Radio 4 should have given more time to this discourseSchools should stop telling parents how to raise their children, Ofsted report says EastEnders and Coronation Street \u0026#39driving the decline of TV audiences\u0026#39Vanity Fair star Olivia Cooke: how to be a leading lady with an Oldham accentBuy more vegetables instead of omega-3 supplements to improve heart health, report says Hot weather and World Cup gives Scotland\u0026#39s shops largest sales increase for more than four yearsImmigrant children describe hunger and cold in detentionTeenage son of British oil executive killed in Corfu speedboat tragedyLondoners least liberal on homosexuality and pre-marital sexThe Five Billion Pound Super Sewer, review: it turns out that watching people boring a big hole is, well, boringInside Facebook: Secrets of the Social Network, review - Reveals disturbing posts that Facebook allows on its siteBody of enforcer for notorious crime family exhumed after two raids by grave robbersSwimwear model wins praise after breastfeeding daughter on catwalk Vienna\u0026#39s metro hands out 14,000 deodorants to passengers amid stifling summer heatwaveBBC art historian says galleries prevent visitors taking phone photos so they can sell more tea-towels and postcardsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

He studied for 13 years at the Dar ul-Uloom Deoband, the most influential Muslim seminary in south Asia, speaks fluent Pashto and wears local dress.After working for the BBC\u0027s Pashto service in the 1990s and creating another popular soap called New Home, New Life, he then set up his own production house, Pact Radio, in Jalalabad in 2004.With a passion for Pashto radio and a mission to find “traditional solutions for modern problems” his soaps have in the past tackled women\u0027s rights, militancy, the rule of law and health.Health issues have also become a favourite of British soaps, with Coronation Street and The Archers recently tackling sepsis and several storylines revolving around mental health.“You can actually bring up issues in a soap opera which you can\u0027t bring up in day to day journalism,” he said.Recent plot lines have seen characters debate polio vaccination and question hearsay that drops are harmful. Extremists have preached against the global vaccination programme and health workers have been attacked in Afghanistan and Pakistan.“Pashtuns will just believe anything you tell them and that\u0027s the whole problem actually.“Whatever the facts say, they don\u0027t believe facts, they believe hearsay, they believe rumour and that\u0027s what the problem with polio is. If someone says its Bush\u0027s urine, okay it\u0027s Bush\u0027s urine.“There is a saying in Pashto that if you tell a Pashtun a dog has bitten off your ear, then the Pashtun will run after the dog, but won\u0027t check his ear to see if it\u0027s there or not.”Mr Butt still ides his time between Afghanistan and India.“It\u0027s a very infuriating country but then at the same time you feel that you are doing some good,” he said.But the country\u0027s complexities can provide great radio, he said.“You listen sometimes to The Archers and it\u0027s all \u0027the Environmental Agency is going to be coming and checking your land, because your land is contaminated\u0027 and this and that. It\u0027s really boring actually, the Archers.

particularly for picnics and barbecues - and a one per cent rise in other goods. But separate figures showed unemployment in Scotland increased by 5,000 between March and May, despite it falling by 12,000 across the UK as a whole.Ewan MacDonald-Russell, the SRC\u0027s head of policy and external affairs, said: Scots, perhaps unused to one of the hottest Junes in a century, sought out drinks, fans, barbeques and paddling pools to cool off and enjoy the sunshine.In particular this month consumers were keen on picnic and barbecue food, reflecting the unusual opportunity to consistently eat outside. There were also strong drinks sales due both to the weather, but also as a result of the series of sporting events on television, not least the World Cup.But he warned the big question was whether consumers would continue their spending spree after the weather returns to normal or if the increase was a shoppers\u0027 summer fling.Sales of barbecue food have spiked in ScotlandPaul Martin, KPMG\u0027s head of retail, said: “June’s warmer weather may have provided some welcome relief, but we know it’s not likely to last. As temperatures cool, retailers must look to other ways to maintain growth in a sector undergoing significant change.”The number of Scots out of work has increased to 120,000, official figures disclosed yesterday, with the unemployment rate standing at 4.3 per cent.This compares with 3.8 per cent in the same quarter last year and is slightly higher than the UK-wide figure of 4.2 per cent.Jamie Hepburn, the SNP\u0027s Fair Work Minister, highlighted that the number of people in employment increased by a thousand.But David Mundell, the Scottish Secretary, said: his rate is still below that of the rest of the UK and I urge the Scottish Government to use its powers to help more people into work and strengthen Scotland\u0027s economy.Meanwhile, Citizens Advice Scotland (CAS) published research showing rural businesses are being held back by parcel delivery surchages and poor broadband.One in five small and medium enterprises (SMEs) said they could not function without the postal service, but nearly a quarter (23 per cent) pay surcharges and 21 per cent experience delivery delays.CAS also found that a third of SMEs report a poor or variable broadband service, rising to 45 per cent in remote or rural areas.Derek Mitchell, CAS chief executive, said this simply isn\u0027t good enough and the research would be passed to Scottish and UK ministers.Please review our commenting policyDisabled comedian Tanyalee Davis \u0026#39humiliated\u0026#39 by train staff rejects apologyJeremy Corbyn called an \u0026#39anti-Semite and a racist\u0026#39 by former Labour minister Margaret HodgeLong-lost cache of British explorer discovered buried in Australian outback by former F1 driverComment: At a certain stage in a person’s life, driving becomes a licence to killComment: The Japanese may say no to intercourse, but Radio 4 should have given more time to this discourseSchools should stop telling parents how to raise their children, Ofsted report says EastEnders and Coronation Street \u0026#39driving the decline of TV audiences\u0026#39Buy more vegetables instead of omega-3 supplements to improve heart health, report says Vanity Fair star Olivia Cooke: how to be a leading lady with an Oldham accentImmigrant children describe hunger and cold in detentionTeenage son of British oil executive killed in Corfu speedboat tragedyLondoners least liberal on homosexuality and pre-marital sexThe Five Billion Pound Super Sewer, review: it turns out that watching people boring a big hole is, well, boringInside Facebook: Secrets of the Social Network, review -

Speaking at the launch of the series, she said: “I do wonder if I hadn’t gone to America, where my accent didn’t matter and it was just, ‘Oh, what part of London is Manchester in?’ - I don’t know if I’d have been able to come here and then be one of the leads in an ITV drama, and not just seen as ‘maid number three’.”Olivia Cooke plays the scheming Becky SharpThe lavish seven-part adaptation promises a “modern” take on the 19th century novel.Pop and rock songs are played over the credits, including Madonna’s Material Girl. The servant character, Sambo, has been renamed Sam and the racist attitudes of his employers, Mr and Mrs Sedley, are highlighted.The director, James Strong, said he had tried to create “a period drama for people who don’t normally like period drama”.“The pop songs - if they’d had them at the time, they’d be in the book,” he said, adding that it would make the story accessible “for people who might think, ‘Vanity Fair, literary classic - I’m a bit bored.’”The drama has a contemporary resonance in today’s selfie-obsessed, Instagram culture, according to the screenwriter, Gwyneth Hughes, and a generation that values “the constant showing off about your life rather than living it”.Royal Academy of Dramatic ArtDisabled comedian Tanyalee Davis \u0026#39humiliated\u0026#39 by train staff rejects apologyJeremy Corbyn called an \u0026#39anti-Semite and a racist\u0026#39 by former Labour minister Margaret HodgeLong-lost cache of British explorer discovered buried in Australian outback by former F1 driverComment: At a certain stage in a person’s life, driving becomes a licence to killComment: The Japanese may say no to intercourse, but Radio 4 should have given more time to this discourseSchools should stop telling parents how to raise their children, Ofsted report says EastEnders and Coronation Street \u0026#39driving the decline of TV audiences\u0026#39Buy more vegetables instead of omega-3 supplements to improve heart health, report says Hot weather and World Cup gives Scotland\u0026#39s shops largest sales increase for more than four yearsImmigrant children describe hunger and cold in detentionTeenage son of British oil executive killed in Corfu speedboat tragedyLondoners least liberal on homosexuality and pre-marital sexThe Five Billion Pound Super Sewer, review: it turns out that watching people boring a big hole is, well, boringInside Facebook: Secrets of the Social Network, review - Reveals disturbing posts that Facebook allows on its siteBody of enforcer for notorious crime family exhumed after two raids by grave robbersSwimwear model wins praise after breastfeeding daughter on catwalk Vienna\u0026#39s metro hands out 14,000 deodorants to passengers amid stifling summer heatwaveBBC art historian says galleries prevent visitors taking phone photos so they can sell more tea-towels and postcardsEmmanuel Macron urges business to hire talent from \u0026#39World Cup banlieues\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/22/15/car-production.jpg","title":"japan trade deal brexit uk car manufacturing european union nissan honda","story":"Created with Sketch.Government may need to offer additional concessions because of Brexit, claim expertsClick to followThe Independent OnlineWorkers at Nissan\u0027s plant in Sunderland on the production line The UK will be under pressure to replicate the European Union\u0027s trade deal with Japan if it wants to protect thousands of\u0026nbspjobs at car companies like Nissan and Honda, analysts have suggested.Her government may even have to make extra concessions in negotiating a separate free trade agreement, experts believe, due to potential disruption caused by the UK\u0027s exit from the EU.Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe and Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, signed the comprehensive trade pact.\u0026nbspIf ratified before Britain leaves next March it is expected to apply in the UK during the transition period, granting\u0026nbspsome breathing room to negotiators.Japan and the EU account for about a third of global GDP and their trade relationship has room to grow, according to European\u0026nbspofficials who expect the deal to boost the EU economy by 0.8 per cent and Japan\u0027s by 0.3 per cent in the long term.But Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, a former EU trade official, warned that Britain would likely have to hew closely to the terms of the bloc’s deal if it wanted to retain Japanese investment and avoid the “really likely scenario that the EU and Japan would be better integrated than the EU and UK”.He told the\u0026nbspFinancial Times: “Under such a scenario, we can easily assume that the Japanese investments currently going to the UK would flow to the single market or Turkey instead.”Ross Denton, from law firm Baker McKenzie, agreed, telling Sky News:\u0026nbsp”There will of course be strong pressure on the UK to replicate the EU’s agreement with Japan as part of its own web of new bilateral trade agreements.”The European Commission believes that, by slashing tariffs on cars and parts between the bloc and Japan, production and jobs in Japanese factories inside the EU could rise. Currently Japanese car makers have 16 research and development centres, and 14 factories, inside the EU employing 34,000 people directly and supporting another 127,000 jobs.But the car companies’ operations across national borders within the bloc could be hampered by Brexit, another expert said.World news in picturesPresident Barack Obama delivers the 16th Nelson Mandela annual lecture, marking the centenary of the anti-apartheid leader\u0027s birth, in Johannesburg, South AfricaFrench supporters celebrate on the Champs Elysees their team\u0027s victory after the World Cup 2018 final between France and CroatiaHugo Lloris lifts the trophy after France beat Croatia 4-2 in the World Cup final in the Luzhniki Stadium in RussiaGermany\u0027s Angelique Kerber beat seven-time champion US player Serena Williams in the Wimbledon final.

Born in Brieg, Prussia (now Poland), he trained on piano, cello, organ and percussion.As a youth he was forced to play in Volkssturm, an army band established by the Nazis in late 1944, btut an inoperable injury to his hand at the age of 16 meant he had permanent tendon problems.The injury forced him to move\u0026nbspaway from playing instruments and into conducting, and was also why he never used a baton. From the Kimsche Oper to Dresden Philharmonic, he led numerous orchestras and opera companies throughout the newly formed post-war East Germany.Most notably in his time in Europe, Mr Masur became leader of the Leipzig Gewandhaus in 1970, one of the continent\u0027s most prestigious orchestras, and held the position for 26 years. Such was his influence from powerful conducting and musicianship, he convinced East German Chancellor Eric Honecker to rebuild the Gewandhaus\u0027 concert hall.His force of will also allowed him to overcome the challenges of the era and take the orchestra on international tours. But it was in 1989 that arguably his greatest moment would come. Political upheaval was in the air as the Soviet Union collapsed, and as thousands of Leipzig residents took to the streets to protest, Mr Masur would take on a stunning public role.On 9 October he invited the masses into his orchestra\u0027s concert hall and held what was likely the first public debate East Germany had known. His cultural status had afforded Mr Masur a measure of soft power, but this was different. This was quite a moment for a man who had never been a member of East Germany\u0027s ruling Communist party.“No one knew what would happen, and I had only some minutes to decide .... But I also knew that if I didn\u0027t do something I would regret it for the rest of my life,” he told The Independent in 1994.“I got a message from the church - a boy came to me: \u0027Mr Masur, you know there is a police order to beat this demonstration down.\u0027 And this was a clear message: they would shoot. I phoned my wife and said, I think I have to intervene. She said OK. So I opened the doors. The police didn\u0027t come in.”\u0026nbsp​When a chance to conduct for the New York Philharmonic (NYP) came up, Mr Masur seized it. He remained as music director from 1991 to 2002, while holding the Gewandhaus job simultaneously until 1996. While he was not the most charismatic or flamboyant person at the podium, Mr Masur become known for improving an orchestra that had gained a reputation for not being able to hit its previous heights.Leaving the NYP in 2002 was not his decision, Mr Masur later said, but he became the orchestra\u0027s first music director emeritus. He would also work as the principal conductor for the London Philharmonic from 2000 to 2007 and as the music director for the National Orchestra of France from 2002 to 2008. He was also honorary guest conductor of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.In 2012, Mr Masur announced he had Parkinson\u0027s disease, which he had been suffering from for many years. That year he was sent to hospital after falling off the podium during a concert in Paris. He died from complications from the disease at the age of 88 in Greenwich, Connecticut.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The nature of our future trading relationship with the European Union straddles so many Tory totems from the role of business to the European Court of Justice to the border with Ireland. As a consequence an internal party “deal”\u0026nbspthat took two years to put together fell apart within two days and now we are once more the laughing stock of Europe with only a matter of months before we leave.Reforging 40 years of economic, political and societal links in a constructive, inclusive and forward-looking way would be a challenge for any government but is clearly far beyond the capacity of this one. As a government in waiting, it is Labour’s job not only to hold the government to account but to set out what our approach would be. This is the work that Keir Starmer and Labour’s Brexit team has undertaken, exemplified by the amendments our party tabled to the Great Repeal Bill. But it is also my job as shadow minister for industrial strategy to consider what Brexit means for our economic future and to place decisions in that context. And that has to mean an economic future that\u0026nbspincludes everyone, and does not merely carry over the regional and social ides that helped deliver the referendum result in the first place.To achieve this we need to look back even as we look forward. And to look outwards to the world even as we consider how best to maintain a close relationship with the European Union.The industrial landscape of Britain today is the product of a succession of industrial strategies or non-strategies, each of which was ultimately unable to deal with the reality of the larger world economy. Britain entered the 20th century hoping to maintain its position as the supplier of manufactured goods to the largest empire the world had ever known, a strategy that could not be sustained given the scale of US industry and the understandable desire of the rest of the Empire to build its own industrial base. By the 1960s, British industry was increasingly focused on our domestic market, but even that more limited “strategy”\u0026nbspproved untenable in the face of more efficient and larger scale foreign competition from the United States, Japan, Germany, Korea\u0026nbspand ultimately China.In response, the Tories under Margaret Thatcher and her successors, and to a lesser extent the 1997 Labour government, pursued a kind of “anti-industrial strategy”. This substituted first North Sea oil and then City of London financial services for industrial competitiveness. North Sea oil was a finite national asset that delivered the expected temporary economic boost. The impact of our burgeoning financial sector was more complex. It brought substantial benefits in jobs, revenues and social capital, particularly to London. It also drove the “financialisation”\u0026nbspof our economy.Financialisation\u0026nbsp– the anti-industrial strategy The way in which financialisation proved to be an anti-industrial strategy is admirably set out in leading economist Mariana Mazzucato’s new book The Value of Everything. In it she describes the “two faces of financialisation”.The first of these is the way in which the financial sector has stopped resourcing the real economy – instead of investing in companies that produce “stuff”, finance is financing finance. Why lend money to a manufacturer that may fail when you can make a bet on some options hedged with other options that virtually guarantee a return in a few weeks? The owner of a medium-sized manufacturing business gave me a striking example of this recently. His high-street bank was initially supportive when he requested a loan for new manufacturing equipment, which would significantly boost productivity. Once the bank realised that the equipment would not be something they could sell on should he go bankrupt, their interest drained away entirely. It was willing to lend based on liquidation value, but was not willing to take a risk on a living business. In a financialised economy, capital tends to flow towards standardised securities rather than actual operating businesses that present bespoke risks.But it is not only financial capital that is erted from the real economy. Human capital is sucked in too. When I graduated from Imperial College in 1987, I would estimate that only about 10 per cent of my electrical engineering cohort went into industry. The majority went into management consultancy and finance, which paid better as well as having clearer career paths. Recently the dean of an engineering department told me that was still the case and asked how I could expect engineers to go into engineering when finance paid so much better and was quite honestly the only way a graduate engineer could ever hope to buy a home in London.I responded that they should come to Newcastle where not only could they buy a lovely home on an engineer’s salary, but also be within a few minutes of some of the most beautiful countryside in the world and at the heart of a concentration of culture that rivals far bigger cities. I recognise the dean’s point – with so much financial engineering demanding money and people, real engineering doesn’t stand a chance. But it is real engineering that drives industrial productivity.Financialisation is not just a problem because it drains resources away from industry. In a financialised economy, investors with short-term horizons tend to have more control over firms. This results in less reinvestment of profits and rising burdens of debt that, in a vicious cycle, makes industry even more driven by short-term considerations. In effect, this kind of finance is not neutral but changes the nature of what it finances.This was seen just recently with the GKN takeover by “turnaround company”\u0026nbspMelrose. An estimated 20 to 25 per cent of the shares in GKN were in the hands of hedge funds, many of which were expected to back the takeover – with the firm Elliott Advisors, owning 3.8 per cent\u0026nbspof the company, explicitly doing so. The bid was won by 52 per cent to 48 per cent. And Melrose itself is not run in any long-term interest other than maximising shareholder value: it has a long history of operating as a “turnaround firm” and almost a third of its own shares are held by hedge funds. The vote was essentially a referendum about the time horizons of British industry, and Britain lost.So when bankers and chancellors talk of having learned\u0026nbspthe lessons of the financial crisis they are wrong both at the macro and micro level. With UK national debt twice what it was in 2007 and household debt to disposable income at a record high, 10 years after the crash of\u0026nbspthe global economy, finance is once again at the heart of an existential threat to our way of life.Financialisation and inequality Even before the crash, this “anti-industrial strategy”\u0026nbspdrove social and geographic inequalities. Levels of income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient reached a pre-crash peak of 0.35 in the 1990s and, while improving slightly, remained high in comparison to the Sixties throughout the 2000s. Regional inequality was also a significant feature of the pre-crash economy, with data from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research showing a gradual rise throughout the 2000s in the difference in gross household income between regions. In 2005, average household income in the North East was 14 per cent below the UK average, while in London it was 20 per cent higher.Gini Coefficient 1961-2016 – 1 is the most unequal score, 0 is the most equal\u0026nbsp(Institute for Fiscal Studies)The Tories were either indifferent to these inequalities or at best felt they were an acceptable price to pay. Labour, under previous leaderships, believed that redistributive policies could make it all come out right in the end, and flagship programmes such as Sure Start and working tax credits certainly helped. But both approaches were fundamentally mistaken. Financialisation turned out to be a house built on sand – unable to generate enough wealth to compensate for the abandonment of the rest of the economy, and vulnerable to boom and bust cycles. Ultimately, the financial crisis of 2008 and the global economic crisis it spawned showed that the ideology of finance – that financial markets and institutions, left to themselves and the profit motive, would efficiently allocate capital – was a pernicious fantasy.British industry—creating real value in the real economyBut that was not the whole story. While\u0026nbspmetropolitan London came to comprise 40 per cent\u0026nbspof the British economy – and a 40 per cent\u0026nbspheavily dependent on finance and professional services – something else was happening in the rest of the country. Britain’s entry into the European Union, and the survival in parts of Britain of a culture favourable to engineering and manufacturing, fostered the growth of certain sectors of British industry as part of a larger integrated European industrial base. The supply chains of large European firms such as Airbus, Boeing and BMW are substantially British. Nissan’s Sunderland plant is the final destination for parts manufactured across Europe and produces more cars per worker than any other factory in the European Union. And GKN, itself one of the world’s oldest engineering firms, is a key supplier to international aerospace and automotive firms – including European giant Airbus, which warned against the Melrose takeover. Factories engaged in producing components and sub-assemblies and assembling components from elsewhere in Europe are now critical to the prosperity of much of Britain. Figure 1 shows just one of BMW’s many supply chains.Such integration requires frictionless borders but also agreed standards to define everything from the acceptable frequency of electromagnetic radiation to the atomic composition of a given chemical. Leaving the European Union will not mean less regulation simply more duplication. As they scramble to recreate existing EU agencies and regulations, businesses and government departments are realising that far from Brussels bureaucracy being imposed upon Britain, the European Union was effectively based on the “shared back office services”\u0026nbspmodel that Whitehall now champions for local government.In many ways, British agriculture has followed a similar trajectory to British car manufacturing, where British farmers have been able to successfully compete on both quality and price in markets defined by EU food safety rules. For example, British farmers export far more wheat flour to the EU – approximately 250,000 tonnes last year – than they do to non-EU countries – approximately 6,000 tonnes. The same goes for other agricultural products such as barley (one\u0026nbspmillion tonnes versus 50,000 tonnes) and oats (16,000 tonnes versus 4,000 tonnes).The EU is the largest importer and exporter of food in the world. As an EU member state, our farmers have benefited from preferential access to this market through exemptions from the tariffs and quotas imposed on non-member countries. And with 85 per cent of seasonal agricultural workers in the UK coming from Bulgaria and Romania, agriculture is one of the UK sectors most heavily dependent on freedom of movement.Food and drink is Britain’s largest manufacturing sector and Europe’s complex rules of origin guidelines could lead to a “hidden hard Brexit”\u0026nbsprequiring the restructuring of food manufacturing supply chains even if we secure preferential access.\u0026nbspAgriculture and manufacturing are both more important outside of London and particularly around the very market towns that have been most “left behind” by the new economy.As Britain contemplates how to engage with the world before, during and after Brexit, we need to understand the trade policy choices we make will drive the shape of our economy and are therefore also industrial policy choices, choices that will shape the very nature of what work we do, the health of our communities\u0026nbspand the way we live for decades to come.  The benefits of a customs union The Labour Party is united in supporting a customs union with Europe. We believe it will bolster our current industrial strengths and offer the possibility of continued industrial revival in certain sectors. We should not be complacent about this approach. Our place in the larger European manufacturing economy will still depend on our ability to innovate and to invest, so that British firms successfully manage and not just participate in supply chains. And this will depend on our learning the lessons of the financial crisis so that our financial markets and institutions actually invest in productive sectors.Unfortunately, the government continues to act as if the only issues in financial regulation are safety, soundness and fraud. While these are obviously important issues, they completely miss the question of whether our financial system is effectively channelling capital to productive and innovative investment. And this is the whole point of a financial system. A financial system that simply parks money in risk-free assets or honestly gambles on sporting events, would meet the characteristics the Tories have established but would still be a total failure. As Mazzucato argues, the traditional policies we have seen create a “healthy financial sector (bailed out, ring-fenced, and restructured) in a deeply sick economy”.Implications for industrial strategy of the alternativesLast week’s visit by President Trump to Britain revealed that he thinks the UK-US relationship is “the highest level of special”. Arch Brexiteers argue that he offers an alternative to a customs union with Europe: a free trade agreement with the United States, which, as a consequence of Nafta\u0026nbspwould really be a free trade agreement with all of North America. But while\u0026nbspthe US economy is of comparable size to the EU in GDP terms, $19 trillion (£14 trillion)\u0026nbspcompared to $17 trillion, they have different sectoral compositions and regulatory standards. Going in this direction would lead to substantial changes in the structure of the British economy.Earlier this year, trade experts at Harvard University published a report that included a candid assessment of obstacles to a US-UK free trade agreement. Its authors, including former shadow chancellor Ed Balls, reached the conclusion that it is “highly unlikely that a free trade deal between the US and the UK will be secured in the near term”\u0026nbspand, in addition, “the likely potential benefits for British businesses are less than often suggested”.The report focused on likely US demands for access to British food markets and likely British demands for access for British firms to US financial and professional services markets. These demands map the likely direction a US-UK free trade agreement would take both countries. Britain is attractive to the US as a market for agricultural products and for goods manufactured through US-controlled supply chains. Britain is also seen by some as a source of relatively low cost financial and professional services. Without an EU customs union, American business does not see Britain as a manufacturing platform – British wages are too high given the distance to the North American market. Labour costs per hour in manufacturing are on average £27 in the US and £23 in the UK – a £4 difference that does not compensate for transport costs.In a UK detached from the European market, the role of British industry in European supply chains will therefore not be replaced by similar roles in US-based supply chains. This is the critical point for UK manufacturing – we cannot replace European supply chain integration with North American supply chain integration.In addition, if British food safety rules are relaxed as part of a trade deal with the US, it is likely that cheap American agricultural products will significantly displace British agriculture. So we will eat chlorinated chicken from Arkansas, bake with GM flour from Dakota\u0026nbspand barbecue antibiotic drenched beef from Illinois. US farming is largely in the hands of mega industrial organisations. Agriculture is a much greater proportion of US GDP than it is of UK GDP. There are farms in Texas that are bigger than major UK counties – 500 square miles, for example. We cannot compete with agriculture on that scale without harming our landscape and bioersity, especially given that we already use substantially more of our land in percentage terms on agriculture than does the US. If our markets are opened up to US agricultural products, UK farming will either adapt to US food safety practices and scale or our agriculture will diminish greatly. If we were to follow the bidding of the arch-Brexiteers and take the US as our model partner it would be the end of our landscape and bioersity as we currently know it.In the place of agriculture and industry, there will be a US market for British financial services and other professional services such as\u0026nbsplaw, accountancy and management consulting. However, just as we have seen the integration of British manufacturing into European firms, we will likely see a wave of mergers and acquisitions in services as British firms are acquired by US firms seeking to serve the US market with British professionals. As a consequence, while\u0026nbspmanufacturing and agriculture would suffer, services and finance might not remain in British hands, especially given the current takeover regime that substantially limits the scope for government protection of UK businesses.A Britain without a customs union with the EU and with a free trade agreement with the US would have less industry, less agriculture, but more finance and more service sector jobs. It would likely be a Britain of growing regional and social disparities, and a Britain more vulnerable to financial instability. After all, it was the high concentration of financial services in the UK economy that meant we were hit particularly hard by the last financial crisis. If the UK economy consolidates further around finance, then we will become even more vulnerable.Turning from North America some look to the Commonwealth as an alternative future that harks to our past. We have strong ties to English-speaking Commonwealth countries around the world – economic ties as well as ties of language, immigration and history. In a digital world, we have the possibility of building networks of innovation that could contribute both to our own industrial competitiveness as well as the competitiveness of our partners.Countries as erse as Nigeria, Australia and India are all racing to be centres of technological innovation and to solve pressing problems in areas such as energy and education. In a sense, if we are open to our former colonies as partners, and generous with access to our own centres of innovation, we could perhaps create alternative pathways to competitiveness for our industry.But those same countries have requested access to the UK through preferential visa arrangements as part of any free trade agreement. India has requested an increase in the number of visas issued to skilled Indian workers and allow students to stay for longer after graduating, but so far government has refused calls to relax visa rules even within the current framework. Australia and other Commonwealth countries want their citizens to be granted the same rights as Europeans: to live and work in the UK after Brexit.Building a competitive commonwealth innovation network effectively requires the opposite of our current attitudes towards the Global South. Commonwealth leaders have criticised the government’s – reported – characterisation of post-Brexit trade as ‘Empire 2.0’. This was reflected in our treatment of the Windrush generation, which, in a sense, like our approach to Brexit, threatens to close critical doors to a better future for British industry and for Britain as a whole.Whether we look to North America or the Commonwealth, into our past or forward to the type of economy we want to become, the arguments bring us back to a customs union with the EU and an industrial strategy that will help rebalance the economy and provide the directed investment to get it growing again. The billions poured by the Bank of England into quantitative easing have signally failed to do this.A Labour government would invest £250bn over 10 years through our National Transformation Fund, and set up a National Investment Bank, as well as a network of regional development banks to channel investment into productive enterprises across the country, unlocking productivity and creating growth.Royal family release official photos from Prince Louis’s christeningPrince William and Prince Charles ‘refused to meet Trump’A history of tense meetings between US and Russian presidentsWe need to understand as we approach critical decision points around our trade policy and our financial regulatory policy\u0026nbspthat these are choices that will shape not just our relations with the outside world but Britain itself – that choices labelled trade policy or immigration policy or financial regulatory policy are in fact industrial policy, agricultural policy and economic policy.The Tory party ideologues are in no state to set out a vision for our future economy, far less to rationally assess the policies needed to make it a reality. Financialisation has proven to be an economic dead-end, creating wealth for the few at the expense of social equality, regional balance and long-term productivity growth.To build a more competitive and equal Britain post-Brexit we need a deal that strengthens our productive sectors such as manufacturing rather than one that deepens financialisation and risks our long-term prosperity. We also need a real industrial strategy based on our regional strengths that enables investment in the productive economy, delivering jobs in our towns as well as our cities that creates value regionally and nationally that can be shared by all.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

With an estimated worth of $1bn, a trade body and a recognised marketing award, they have finally been tamedClick to followThe Independent OnlinePep talk: Kendall Jenner’s Pepsi advert was pulled shortly after it aired for appearing to trivialise demonstrations tackling social causesLast month, the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity –\u0026nbspthe biggest grouping of advertising and marketing people you could ever hope to avoid –\u0026nbspintroduced a new award: the Social and Influencer\u0026nbspcategory.Yes, those\u0026nbspgurning thumb-flexers forever punching #YOLO, #instacool and #nofilter into their smartphones as they plug products have come of age.\u0026nbspInfluencer-dom is now a fully-fledged industry. Yet only a year or two ago we were told by many (rather gleefully in some cases) that the influencer was dead or at least in crisis.Earlier this year, this seemed to be confirmed as the owner of the White Moose Cafe in Dublin turned the tables on\u0026nbsp22-year-old YouTube vlogger and influencer Elle Darby, by exposing her demand for five free hotel nights in return for exposure.His public burn spoke for many: “If I let you stay here in return for a feature in a video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you?” The twitter-mob turned on influencers. Who were they? How do they get away with it? Do they actually earn money?When the influencer marketing industry began (around 2008-10, attest the form’s historians) the notion took hold that like celebrity endorsement before it, aspirational people could become marketing tools, accessing the consumer mind as if a recommendation from a friend.YouTuber with 139,095 subscribers, was refused a free hotel stay (YouTubeElle Darby)As one observer put it:\u0026nbsp“They emerged almost overnight and in 10 years have gone from a small network to a worldwide community.” Some sources suggest that there is now a baseline of 1.1 million influencers worldwide.\u0026nbspMediakix estimated\u0026nbspthe industry was worth more than $1bn\u0026nbsp(£750m)\u0026nbspin 2017. Malcolm Gladwell’s coinage, “the tipping point”, was used a lot in meetings.\u0026nbspBy about 2014, a baffled world had started to understand influencer marketing, but the industry’s breakthrough year was probably 2016 when, as Hamda Issa-Salwe of Bravado, part of Universal Music Group, found when she did a research thesis called Investigating the Use of Influencer Marketing on Social Media.“It began to soar,” she says. “Google classified ‘influencer’ as a breakout keyword with a 5,000 per cent month by month increase in the number of times the search term ‘influencer marketing’ was typed.”Also in 2016, it was established that Kendall Jenner was paid an estimated $300,000 per social media post. Advertising agencies took more careful notice of influencers and Instagram –\u0026nbspfounded in 2010 – became the key station of the social media cross, along with other key platforms\u0026nbspsuch as YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest.Even the fustiest legacy-media type can now see the point. The barrier to entry is low. All you need is a smartphone and a certain brio. And the research seems to add up. According to Nielsen, 84 per cent\u0026nbspof consumers trust opinions from people they know, while 70 per cent\u0026nbsptake action based on other consumer’s opinions online.vlogger Zoella reportedly has a net worth of £2.5m (InstagramZoella)The Association of National Advertisers found that 75 per cent\u0026nbspof members already work with influencers, and the growing industry will take 20 per cent\u0026nbspof the total global marketing budget by 2023.No wonder that 82 per cent\u0026nbspof millennials hope to become influencers at least, according to a survey by London-based dating app CLiKD.\u0026nbspSo the money’s talking, and influencers can do well.It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rentAs Anthony Svirskis, CEO\u0026nbspof TRIBE and a juror on the\u0026nbspSocial and Influencer award says:\u0026nbsp“On a post by post basis, brands should expect to pay £50 for someone with 3,000 followers and upwards of £300 if someone has more than 100,000 followers.” Small wonder the market is seething with aspirant influencers.\u0026nbspYet influencers are still derided as being without any particular skills: even that they’re the apotheosis of the entitled “Me” generation, spreading paid-for blandishments in vocal-fry vlogs on YouTube.While it’s hard to blame someone who travels the world in return for Instagram snaps, is there an influencer bubble waiting to burst? Paul Dyer, of marketing company Lippe Taylor, believes it will, as trust has disappeared from the sector in the sceptical Facebook-Cambridge Analytica era.“There is tremendous value in influencer marketing,” he said recently. “However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls out.”Indeed, there have been several influencer #epicfails, perhaps the most notable being\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspFestival, the ill-fated 2017 Bahamas musical festival that paid Kendall Jenner and Bella\u0026nbspHadid\u0026nbspto drum up support.\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspbombed and the repercussions are ongoing.There’s also an undergrowth of freebie-hunting influencers harassing hotels and providers. Some hotels – the\u0026nbspDusit\u0026nbspThani\u0026nbspresort in the Males among them – now use weeding out processes. “When they work hotels love them,” says one travel PR.\u0026nbspThe influencer economy … is a market irrationality. Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money“Influencers are uncritical and often share films and photographs that would otherwise be paid for. But there’s a trust problem.”There are other cracks in the influencer edifice as brands begin to ask questions about the business efficacy of influencers. As publicist Mark Borkowski says:\u0026nbsp“More brands are beginning to realise that influencer activity doesn’t necessarily drive ROI.”And the pain is on both sides, he adds. “It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rent.” Anti-influencers are coming of the woodwork –\u0026nbspand they’re not all crusty oldies with a grudge.“The influencer economy … is a market irrationality,” wrote Sam Biddle of Gawker in 2016. “Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money.” As for bots and fake followers, that’s a real problem.Fyre Festival attendees locked in airport ‘for their own safety’At Cannes, Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed called for industry action to clean out the influencer stable, and vowed never to use influencers found to be buying followers.So the sands are shifting. Hamda Issa-Salwe says that while influencer activity remains hard to define and audit, it’s still growing. Although trust and authenticity (the great influencer bon mot) are major factors, brands still spend a lot on influencers: after all,\u0026nbspInstagram has more 800 million monthly active users.And the influencers themselves are fighting back. It’s a new industry: of course legacy dinosaurs wouldn’t get it. It’s just another marketing tool. And what are –\u0026nbspsorry, were –\u0026nbspnewspapers half the time, but a vehicle of paid-for information?“Indeed, there’s a growing distrust of traditional media advertising,” says Harry Hugo, cofounder at The Goat Agency, Europe’s leading influencer agency, which claims to be growing at a rate of 600 per cent\u0026nbspa year.“Just look at the rise in ad blockers, investigations into media transparency and big networks like WPP struggling. Influencers can be one of the most trusted, and therefore highest converting, information sources for people.”\u0026nbspAlso, we jeremiahs just don’t get the craft and graft that goes into an influencer’s brand persona, adds Florencia Lujani, influencer marketing manager at agency We Are Social London.“People struggle to see why brands would pay money to partner with influencers for something which appears relatively simple,” she says. “But it takes time and effort, talent, passion and commitment.”\u0026nbspAnd even the thorny issue of disclosure –\u0026nbspthat is, whether you should know what someone is being paid to promote –\u0026nbspis a smaller issue than is often supposed, says Svirskis. “Influencers are very compliant of requirements to disclose and are often represented by an influencer agency.”There is tremendous value in influencer marketing. However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls outMost importantly of all, influencers make money for clients. Currently, the average ROI of influencer marketing is £7 back for every £1 spent, says Amelia Neate of Influencer Champions.\u0026nbspSo,\u0026nbspdo you have to be pretty? “It’s definitely not reserved for those with looks,” says Svirskis. “The cheesy smiles are long gone.” It’s about style and tone, he says, and as the industry matures it’s moving beyond lifestyle products like travel, beauty and fashion to finance, automotive –\u0026nbspeven dog food.“There are new influencers emerging every day, in every single vertical,” says Lujani. They’re marshalling themselves into communities: mummy bloggers, healthy eaters, sports fans – why, possibly even news organisations.\u0026nbspWith the maturation of the influencer world comes a shakeout: Influencer 2.0, if you will. Sheer numbers don’t matter so much anymore.\u0026nbspThe smart talk is now about engagement and micro-influencers,\u0026nbspthose with fewer than 100,000 followers and possibly as low as 5,000, but with proper peer recognition.\u0026nbspYouTuber Alfie Deyes came under fire for his recent video, ‘How I lived off £1 for a day’ (YouTubePointlessBlogVlogs)“Data shows that influence by measure of engagement actually increases as the audience size reduces,” says Svirskis. In a hedge-betting strategy, brands now prefer to work with 50 micro-influencers rather than one mega-influencer, and brands are taking influencer management in-house as influencer marketing moves into the mainstream.If children are obese then blame food manufacturers, not ZoellaInvestigation promised into Trump campaign data firmThree arrested after Facebook group raid cannabis field – only to Sexist men who abuse women on Facebook and Twitter are compensating“Most new industries go through periods of turbulence as they form foundations,” says Svirskis, who thinks that many of today’s influencers will become tomorrow’s creative directors and entrepreneurs.He has a point. Beauty influencer Emily Weiss now has a cosmetic company, Glossier, and within the last couple of weeks M\u0026ampC Saatchi bought a stake in two influencer agencies. There’s even a new trade body, the Influencer Marketing Association.Circle the wagons and don’t be a #filterfaker\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspthe wild influencer west is being tamed.Cannes Lions International Festival of CreativityEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Dani, Wes, Laura and EyalWith the other contestants spreading rumours and stirring trouble, Jack was finally swayed by new girl Stephanie. Taking Old Laura (not a comment on her age, I hasten to add) to the exact same spot where Wes dumped her, he sat her down for a classic Love Island chat.Sitting in Dump Corner (an unfortunate name that we’re going to stick with), Jack broke the news to a quivering Laura that it was over. Taking it like an absolute champ, Jack strolled off into the sunset - presumably to find out what Stephanie was up to - leaving Laura alone once again.Love Island\u0027s Montana Brown reveals insider secrets about villa lifeLove Island\u0027s Frankie responds to news Samira quit to be with himOfcom receive 630 complaints over Love Island\u0027s treatment of LauraWe’re now left with an awful lot of singletons, which can only mean it’s going to be a dramatic week in the villa.You can catch up with everything that went on in the episode as it happened below.Please allow the\u0026nbspliveblog\u0026nbspa moment to load...Happy Tuesday everybody! Just a few hours to go until tonight\u0027s\u0026nbspLove Island.\u0026nbspIn case you missed it, Charlie and Ellie are the latest islanders to be kicked out, to the disappointment of...well nobody really.Somewhat impressively, Georgia has managed to single handedly\u0026nbspsplit the internet in two. Like Barack Obama looking through a window at some children, she has broken Twitter.\u0026nbspLet\u0027s break the warring factions down. On one side we have Team Georgia, and the other we have...well, Team Anti-Georgia.\u0026nbspTAG are judging Georgia for deciding to breakup with Sam and stay in the villa (therefore still in with a shot at the £50k, even though we know that money is obviously Dani Dyer\u0027s). They think she should\u0027ve left the villa in a display of undying love for Sam. TG, however, are rallying online to her defence, saying that Georgia in fact wanted to leave in a move of dignity, and it was actually Sam who convinced her. TG also say\u0026nbspshe has been a victim of harsh editing (remember Samira, anybody?).\u0026nbspSo which team are you on?Four new Islanders entered the villa last night. First up we have 23-year-old Stephanie Lam, who I must admit made so little impact I can\u0027t remember anything else about her.Our last two new contestants are Paul Knops (who was, fun fact, in Britney\u0027s\u0026nbspMake Me video, so he is obviously now our favourite) and DJ and model Josh Mair.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspI don\u0027t think I realised quite how many DJs and models there are in the world until I watched\u0026nbspLove Island.Apparently s*** is going to hit the fan for Jack and Laura tonight which is not good news. Mainly because I don\u0027t know how much longer I can watch that man pretend he cares about any of this.With £ signs in their eyes, Georgia and Sam made the brave decision to end their blossoming relationship in the pursuit of cash love.\u0026nbspSam has already had a successful date with new contestant Laura, but will Georgia have her head turned tonight?It seems ITV2 appears some viewers\u0026nbspare having streaming issues. Although unconfirmed, several people have reported issues with accessing the channel on ITV Player. We\u0027ll let you know if there are any updates on this.Rumour has it that Dr Alex might be tempted by one of the new women tonight. You are finally settled down Dr Alex, don\u0027t ruin it when the end is so tantalizingly near!Here we go! Let\u0027s begin tonight\u0027s\u0026nbspLove Island...Oh so \u0027loyal\u0027 Georgia has brought over two women over to the firepit for a heart to heart chat.Laura says if it was her and Jack, she would have left. Brutal Laura, brutal.And here comes the drama. Laura says if she was in Georgia\u0027s position, she would have left the villa in a show of love for Jack. He, however, has other ideas (mainly £50k) and secretly said he would stay.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn usual Laura style, she is absolutely furious and has stormed off from the firepit of doom.Poor old Sam is regretting his decision already, saying he can\u0027t talk to the new girls (is that code for I don\u0027t fancy any of them?)Jack is backtracking on everything he said, pleading with ever-furious Laura that he was only comforting Sam. Yeah right mate, you\u0027d drop Laura like a hot cake if the opportunity arose.Now we have new boy Josh who says my type is nice eyes, nice teeth and all the right curves.\u0026nbspI think I was just sick in my mouth new Josh.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

scientists\u0026nbspThe UK must maintain existing relationships with its European neighbours after\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspor face a serious decline in its scientific activities, the

funding\u0026nbspand over half the researchers working in the UK were born overseas.Scientists on both sides of the Channel broadly agree it is in everyone’s interest for the UK to maintain a similar level of cooperation with Europe following Brexit.But Dr\u0026nbspVallance\u0026nbspwarned that such future cooperation is not a “foregone conclusion”.In the meantime, he said it would also be important to look beyond Europe and forge more links with the US and Commonwealth nations to “renew our commitment to international collaboration”.He said: “Our nearest neighbours are outstanding scientists – they have got great universities, great laboratories, great science-led businesses – and we have absolutely got to keep that going.Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP

successful in our science.”He said the deal being pushed for by the government is striving for a system where science being conducted with our European neighbours is not interrupted.In a speech given in May at the Jodrell Bank Observatory, Theresa May said she valued this collaboration and wanted to retain full association with the EU’s proposed €100bn\u0026nbsp(£88.9m) research and innovation scheme – the successor to its Horizon 2020 programme.Woolaston calls for Brexit referendum to be re-runHowever, some have questioned the feasibility of retaining all of the current benefits enjoyed by the UK science community following Brexit.“We would share those aspirations, but we think there is a gap in how the government intends to deliver on them,” said Sue Ferns, deputy general secretary of scientists’ trade union Prospect.“Horizon 2020 was an important source of funding for many UK scientists – clearly the government wants to have access to the successor but the widespread expectation is that we will be paying more and getting less out.”Concerns also remain about the free movement of scientists and their families, and the UK has already parted ways with European collaborations such as the Euratom nuclear agency and the Galileo satellite programme.In an interview with The Independent, particle physicist and TV personality Professor Brian Cox said there is “no upside” to Brexit for UK science – a view that has been echoed by many important figures including the Royal Society president Venkatraman Ramakrishnan.Nevertheless, Dr Vallance said the government is pushing for the best deal possible for scientists.“Although there’s good will on both sides and the scientists want it, it is not a foregone conclusion ever until you’ve done it so we need to keep focused on that, and the prime minister is quite clear on what she wants from this,” he said.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It is just one kilometre in size, and is flying in the opposite direction to many of the planet’s moons – and behaves in an entirely different way to any of the other 78 objects orbiting the planet.As such, it might be responsible for having smashed up many of the other objects that make up the moons around Jupiter.

Scientists expect there are probably around 100 different objects in total.All of the new moons around Jupiter are less than two miles wide. That accounts for why they had been left undiscovered until now, when scientists found them using incredibly sensitive telescopes.The team behind the discovery also found the most distant known object in our solar system – and suggested there might be a mysterious planet, a\u0026nbspPlanet X or Planet Nine, hiding out in the depths of our solar system. The new discovery was made almost by accident as researchers were hunting for more evidence of that world beyond Pluto.“Jupiter just happened to be in the sky near the search fields where we were looking for extremely distant solar system objects, so we were serendipitously able to look for new moons around Jupiter while at the same time looking for planets at the fringes of our solar system,” said Sheppard.Finding how the objects came to be formed and orbit around Jupiter could shed light on the formation of our own solar system. For instance, the new moons are so small that they would be influenced by any gas and dust around the planet – the fact they have managed to survive suggests they formed after the\u0026nbsprotating disk\u0026nbspof gas and dust that surrounded the sun formed into planets.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I knitted cardigans, jumpers, bootees, the lot. They had hand-me-downs of course but they always had nice clothes.\u0026ldquoIf we went anywhere nice or up to the fair, they would always be well-dressed. Ken would sit the boys down and scrub their knees and grease their hair and I would always get the girls ready.Dinner times were equally eventful.

Never a dull moment.And that was certainly the case when one evening a soldier came to call for sister Dotty, who\u0026rsquos now 67, to take her on a blind date.Tracey says: \u0026ldquoDotty answered the door and saw the soldier and thought he wasn\u0026rsquot her cup of tea so she called to Janet (another sister, now aged 65) and said there was someone at the door.\u0026ldquoWell that was it, Janet went on a date with the soldier and they went on to get married.She adds: \u0026ldquoAs kids we all used to bargain with each other.

Sometimes I would just whisper to my brother Peter and tell him that I didn\u0026rsquot want my potatoes and that he could have them.\u0026ldquoHe was always hungry and would sneak downstairs and get bread and sugar and take them up to his room.Despite her family growing considerably over the years, Winny says they all remain close and live near each other.\u0026ldquoThey were all good children.

Following Brexit Day there will be a transition or implementation period which is currently slated to last until December 2020.After a crunch summit at Chequers in the summer of 2018, the PM and her Cabinet put forward her strategy for Britains post-Brexit relationship with the EU.One of the central points of her plan is a facilitated customs arrangement which will allow the UK to set its own tariffs on goods arrival in the country.Borders between the UK and EU would be treated as a combined customs territory and would see the UK apply tariffs and trade policies for goods destined for the UK but charge EU tariffs for goods bound for the EU.The Government believes this system removes the threat of a hard border in Ireland.If Britain leaves the single market and customs union, it may not be given the same complete freedom to move money, people and products around the EU.The European Union will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market if it continues to allow EU nationals the right to live and work in the UK.And being a member of the customs union would stop the UK striking free trade deals with other nations.Theresa May and Olly Robbins, her chief Brexit adviser from the Civil Service, have floated the idea of a scheme which would see Britain continue to collect tariffs on behalf of the EU for goods which enter the UK which are destined for member states.Labour are campaigning to remain in the customs union after Brexit while negotiating a new arrangement.After months of muddled uncertainty, Jeremy Corbyn announced in February 2018 that his party would back the move.Labour wants to see Britain in a bloc where goods and services can move across EU borders without hindrance.But it is likely to stop Britain being able to negotiate its own deals with the rest of the world.Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC: We all want to do bold new trade agreements but wed be better off doing that with the EU.Mr Corbyn said he wants a new and strong relationship with the EU single market that includes tariff-free access.But Labour Leaver Frank Field MP said the U-turn would rat on the peoples decision to leave.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was also Donald Trump’s view in The Sun.But yesterday the PM convinced him otherwise. And she insisted “there will be no limit to the possibility of us doing trade deals around the world”.How are both positions possible? How will we enjoy such flexibility?How will our courts be supreme if we still heed ECJ rulings? How will we have total control of immigration if some EU workers can still come in as they see fit? And what will she do next if Brussels rejects it all?Leave voters’ rising anger is fuelled by the suspicion that behind the repeated assurances we are being stitched up.Mrs May must explain why we’re not. Explain how she talked round a doubting Trump. Explain how we will seize the opportunities Brexit presents. If she wants to admit her plan isn’t ideal but it’s the best there is, this is her moment.It’s time for honesty, not spin. The PM owes it to Britain. DO Remainers really not get the difference between President Obama giving his view on Brexit and President Trump doing so?Obama was egged on by Downing Street in 2016 to try to skew a democratic vote in favour of one side. He told us, falsely, that backing Brexit would put us last in the queue for a US trade deal.Trump’s argument in The Sun two years AFTER the vote was simply that Leave won and he doubted Mrs May’s strategy would fulfil on the verdict.He may be wrong. But Obama definitely was. Because once Trump replaced him, Britain hit the front of the US queue — a position only now threatened by staying tied to Brussels.Happy to help, Remain fans. WE wondered if President Trump might try to shoot the messenger when he realised how embarrassing his world exclusive Sun interview was to his host Mrs May.We’re used to that, of course.

In pubs, in shop windows, on cars, on scaffolding, on hats and shirts and flying above 10 Downing Street.And nobody was sneering at our flag now. Just guessing, but I doubt if anyone will be sneering at that flag any time soon.Not even Labour’s Emily Thornberry.What a ride. What a month-long high. What an adventure for those of us who are old enough to remember 1966 and also for the children who will remember this as the first World Cup they watched.Fifty years from today, those kids will still remember how they felt when England won a penalty shootout against Colombia, and when Kieran Trippier bent it better than Beckham after five minutes against Croatia.And they will remember to their dying day exactly what it felt like when we knew that England was not going to the final.The tears are real but so is the pride. And the pride — even more than the disappointment — is the overwhelming emotion today.England played with big hearts, true grit and the fearlessness of youth.They come home not as legends to rival the boys of 1966 but with their heads held high. Their nation is proud of them.And yes, it is only a game. It is not a war. Nobody died.But at a time when our nation is more horribly divided than at any time in modern history, we were reminded what a great country this still is, and how much we have to be proud of, and how much there is to love.And it was not your imagination — England was united once again.“Our country has been through difficult times in terms of unity,” said England’s young manager in his thoughtful, softly spoken manner.“Sport — football in particular — has the power to help that.“We’re a team that, with our diversity and our youth, represents modern England.In England, we have spent a bit of time being a bit lost as to what our modern identity is. I think we represent that modern identity and hopefully people can connect with us.”Gareth Southgate is right about the healing power of sport. This World Cup brought us together in a way we’ve not experienced since the London 2012 Olympics.But 2012 was before the bitter wounds of Brexit.It is Gareth Southgate himself who is the main reason this country has rallied around this England team.Southgate with his courtesy, his decency and his Yoda-like intelligence.Southgate,  who talks about “owning the process” and “managing our energy” — it is quite difficult to imagine the former England manager, Big Sam Allardyce, being comfortable with that kind of 21st Century dialogue. Southgate with his dapper shirt, tie and waistcoat combo, as suave as a suburban James Bond.Southgate who carries himself as if he is the living embodiment of Rudyard Kipling’s most famous poem.“If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those imposters just the same . . . you will be a man, my son!”Even as England were celebrating their very first win in a World Cup penalty shootout, Southgate took time to comfort Mateus Uribe, one of the two Colombian players who had missed their penalty.This was more than an act of sportsmanship. It was an act of humanity.Because we all knew that Southgate has been there.The abiding memory of Gareth Southgate as a player — the one moment that everyone remembers — is in Euro 1996, with his shoulders sagging inside a grey England shirt and his spirit smashed after missing a penalty (we never recall the players who were too cowardly to step up and take a penalty — history gives them a pass).Stuart “Psycho” Pearce had known penalty redemption — missing in Italia 1990 but scoring in Euro 1996. Southgate’s redemption has been infinitely more convoluted.There was an image that went viral of the 25-year-old Gareth Southgate after just missing a penalty in 1996 being comforted by the 47-year-old Gareth Southgate who shook up the world in Russia in 2018.If this World Cup has gone some way to healing our divided nation, it has also gone a long way to healing the pain that Southgate has endured for half a lifetime.It is true what they say ­— success is not final, failure is not fatal.The manager was well served by this young team, who were light years away from the central casting image of the Premier League footballer — the pampered, wag-shagging, blingtastic, Bentley-crashing, multi-millionaire airhead.These England footballers — even the star striker, Harry Kane, who would cost a minimum £100million if Real Madrid came knocking — were clearly of and from the working class.They hail, every one of them, from modest beginnings. Most of the squad — 15 — paid their Premier League dues while out on loan in the lump-kicking lower leagues.“Barnsley, Leeds, Bolton, Blackburn,” said Southgate. “We’re lads who have come from those places.”This England team are not ordinary boys — they are elite professional athletes — but they have all been ordinary boys, and there was a humility about them, a work ethic and total lack of pretension that made you believe they will never forget their roots.And if they come from everywhere from the North East to Yorkshire to the Essex/East End borders, they also come from every kind of family.There were those who grew up in solid nuclear families with both mum and dad and siblings present, and those who were raised by single mums, and those who are from domestic chaos.Raheem Sterling’s father was murdered in Jamaica when he was two, and Dele Alli escaped the turmoil of his riven family life by moving in with his best friend’s family when he was 13.Their backstories are as diverse as our nation, but every one of them has grafted to get to the top.Sterling was berated for having an assault rifle tattooed on his leg but nobody ran harder or longer for the England cause than Raheem.When you watched his mesmeric, lung-busting runs, how could you not warm to him?How could you not forgive one dumb tatt?“Good lads,” said Southgate of his England squad, those boys from the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne, from Bury and Leeds and Sheffield, and once again he said it all.They are good lads and we cheered them, and celebrated with them, and in the end, we shared their pain because it was our pain too, even in defeat against Belgium yesterday.They were a band of brothers and for one magical sun-drenched summer month, they lit up our nation.This World Cup was a roller-coaster ride that grabbed you by the scruff of your replica Three Lions shirt from the first match against Tunisia and refused to let go until the end of extra time against Croatia.They came SO CLOSE — Croatia led England for 11 minutes.That’s how agonisingly near we were to saying, “Bonjour, Monsieur,” in today’s World Cup final.It was gloriously entertaining, but it was also far more than just entertainment.It felt like Gareth Southgate and that young England team represented the very best of us.We learned — or we were reminded — that decency is not weakness, sportsmanship is not soft, and you need never feel one twinge of shame if you give your all.And we learned that we love our national game with a passion that can never be denied.I honestly thought we would win it.Typical England fan!I believed that this was the year we added the second World Cup winner’s gold star to the team shirt.When the England players were chucking around rubber chickens at a training session just before the Croatia semi-final, I thought it was a tension-busting masterstroke.It wasn’t to be.But this England team have been through the full range of human emotions — from joy to despair, hope to disappointment, and this country has been with them every step of the way.The struggle continues, the dream will never die.I reckon 50,000 England football fans will already be making plans to go to Qatar in 2022.This World Cup will be remembered for breaking our hearts and uniting our nation.And a grateful, emotionally exhausted country has just two words for those Three Lions.Thank you. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One able to set its own laws and control its borders.The idea of taking diktats from European courts, having no border control, and being unable to strike free trade deals — while paying Brussels £39billion — is not the Brexit people voted for.Mrs May should look at our poll today to see the bloody nose the Tories could be dealt at the next General Election.Unless she starts being honest with the country, then she will cause further disillusionment among voters, potentially opening the door to Jeremy Corbyn…Ushering in Britain’s first Marxist PM should not be a legacy Mrs May wants. EXPECTATIONS were not high before the World Cup began — for once.With the pressure lifted off the players’ shoulders — combined with Gareth Southgate’s leadership — our boys played with passion and determination.Despite yesterday’s loss to Belgium, they were real ambassadors for England.Meanwhile, the FA are set to apply for the 2030 World Cup. Good. About time.The tournament will mark a century since the first one in Uruguay.

The first ever officially identified British meteotsunami hit the Cornish coastline in June 2011.British researchers first became aware of the meteotsunami after people walking across St Michaels Mount causeway suddenly found themselves standing in water.Andrew Sibley, of the Met Office, said: The updrafts and downdrafts within a thunderstorm can create small and short-lived pressure changes, leading to initially small sea waves.These waves can then be amplified dramatically by resonance between the speed of the thunderstorm system and the speed of the wave if they are in phase.The speed of the sea wave is related to the sea depth. Such waves can also be funneled by coastal bays, estuaries and inlets.Professor David Tappin of the British Geological Survey added: Most tsunamis are geological, where you have a vertical movement on the seabed which can be caused by an earthquake, like in Japan in 2011, or a landslide.Meteotsunamis, however, are created by weather. You need a small, rapid change in atmospheric pressure of just a few millibars, if you get one of these then it can change the sea surface elevation by a few centimetres.In the deep ocean this would not be noticeable but when it enters shallow water whilst the weather system is moving at the same speed then the sea level increases by several metres."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000420905377-e1531774409462.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"no deal brexit card is already on the table for theresa may the widely misunderstood wto","story":"In particular, by tying us into EU regulatory standards on goods, it would make it difficult to secure Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with other countries, including the United States.Nevertheless, you could argue that this minimal Brexit is better than nothing, and some Leavers have. But this surely depends upon what the other possibilities are. This deserves the serious analysis that Mrs May and her team have apparently not given it.There are broadly two options. The first is to accept one of the off-the-shelf arrangements. The one that most closely accords with achieving a full Brexit, corresponding to what people voted for two years ago, is the recently agreed EU deal with Canada.This is not ideal for us, but it is pretty good. It might be possible to add some bells and whistles that extend the scope of the agreement, particularly with regard to services. This is what is known as “Canada plus”.With or without the plus, this would give us tariff and barrier-free trade between the EU and the UK while ending free movement of people, the payment of substantial sums to Brussels each year and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, while enabling us to sign FTAs with whoever we wanted to.Interestingly, the EU offered us the Canada deal earlier this year but this was turned down by the Prime Minister, supposedly because it wasn’t ambitious enough and because it would not provide a solution to the supposed “problems” concerning the Irish border.Since then, Mrs May’s ambitions have decayed to the delivery of abject surrender while not saying so.As to the Irish border, it has been clear for some time that these “problems” have been manufactured by the Remain-leaning establishment precisely as a way of blocking a full Brexit.There is no need for a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. It is perfectly possible for goods to move freely across the border, relying on pre-registration and subsequent random checks.There is already a soft border between the Irish republic and Northern Ireland with regard to currencies, duties and tax rates. This would continue.Of course, it is possible that the EU will not now agree to something like the Canada deal. And the clock is ticking.In that case, there is another perfectly viable option, namely “no deal”. After all, as Mrs May used to say, “No deal is better than a bad deal”.In fact, this “no deal” expression is potentially misleading. It doesn’t mean that we couldn’t or shouldn’t have a deal on anything with the EU, including landing rights for planes, participation in various joint bodies, etc.What it means is simply that we would leave the EU without an agreement on trade, and operate under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.The WTO option is widely misunderstood. It should hold no terrors for us. We currently do the bulk of our trade with non-EU countries under WTO rules. And if we left the EU without a deal we would not have to hand over the £39billion “divorce settlement”.Moreover, the WTO option leaves substantial areas of policy choice, including over what our tariffs are. We could decide to drop tariffs on particular goods but not others for instance, on cars, which currently incur tariffs at ten per cent, and/or on car components, where the rate is five per cent.Or we could decide, unilaterally, to drop all our tariffs to zero.We could start to negotiate FTAs immediately. Just because we fail to secure a trade deal with the EU before next March does not mean we can never secure such a deal.Indeed, we could put the EU “at the front of the queue” for trade deals. We would be able to conduct negotiations without the pressures emanating from the ticking clock imposed, arbitrarily and ridiculously, under the Lisbon Treaty.Of course, trading under WTO rules would still leave the much-dreaded “trade frictions” and possible delays at the border as we lose the supposedly huge advantages of Single Market membership. But these frictions have been massively overblown by the UK establishment. WTO rules oblige members (including the EU) to facilitate frictionless trade.John Mills, the Eurosceptic economist and Labour donor, has come up with estimates of border costs that are a fraction of the official ones.His view is especially worth noting because, unlike the civil servants behind the official view, he runs his own very successful business importing large amounts of consumer goods. I know whose estimates I believe.Some critics will say that this is all very well for finished goods, but not for the businesses that operate complex supply chains. To listen to them you would think that these only operate within the EU.In fact there are complex supply chains operating across the world. They seem to manage without common currencies, single markets and all the other paraphernalia so beloved by the EU.Meanwhile, umpteen countries around the world sell huge amounts into the EU without being members of the Single Market. How do they manage to overcome those pesky barriers, I wonder?Whatever difficulties may occur in the immediate aftermath of a full Brexit, this does not represent the final destination. Only when FTAs are in place with a broad swathe of countries, including the US, will we be able to see the full impact.The argument that we must accept the Chequers fudge just does not add up.

The only reasonable choice would be deal or no deal.But we must not let it happen. Politics is in a dire enough state. The Tories are in meltdown trying to secure Brexit while fending off Corbyn’s Marxists and the nightmarish ruin they would unleash.Overturning the 2016 referendum result before it had even been carried out would collapse all faith in democracy itself.THERE’S no way of sugar-coating it — police just can’t be bothered investigating burglaries, along with much else.We’ve heard all the excuses: they’re hard to solve, we’re too short-staffed, “Tory cuts” and so on.But victim ­Izabela Siergiej gave them the criminal’s name, address and mugshot.

It was a football jolly, sealing a month-long PR triumph for the Kremlin.Macron should have watched from Paris.TAKING back control of our borders won’t mean a thing if we fail to exercise it.It is worrying that immigration has gone up again thanks to a 13-year high in those arriving from outside the EU — which the Government CAN limit.For years the totals have been too great for our communities to cope with.

Basel 1A’ is a literary text and is more valuable.She added: We can now say that it’s a medical text that describes the phenomenon of ‘hysterical apnea’, (therefore) we assume that it is either a text from the Roman physician Galen or an unknown commentary of work”.Hysterical apnea, better known today as hysteria suffocation, had been previously mentioned by Galen in other texts.His extraordinary claim theorised that women could suffer hysterical apnea if they stopped having sexual intercourse, an affliction clearly not recognised by modern doctors.Despite this, Galen is remembered as one of greatest scholars of antiquity, particularly in modern medicine.Galen’s belief was very similar to that of Hippocrates, “The Father of Medicine”, who was the first to coin the term hysteria.Hippocrates unusual theory believed that hysteria came from a female uterus that was deprived of moisture, which should have been received through intercourse.He called this condition the wandering womb, which if unhappy as a result of this would float around the upper abdomen triggering “stiff breathing and sharp pains in the heart”, according to the text of his ‘Diseases of Women”.Galen advanced this theory further. Whilst he disagreed that the womb wandered, he believed that the hysteria was caused by the retention of an apparent female seed, which would turn poisonous if not released through regular intercourse.His recommendation to curing this was the hastening of marriage, with the implication that regular sex would cure women of hysteria.This theory has of course been debunked by modern medicine. It was not until Sigmund Freud in the 19th Century determined that hysteria was not exclusive to women but could also affect men, and was determined by upbringing, education and social interaction.In time, the focus on hysteria being a condition determined by sexual intercourse disintegrated within Western society. It was not until 1980 that hysteria was no longer diagnosed as a mental disorder."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000421066404.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"londoner moves welsh woodland hobbit house ebay","story":"Kris Harbour owned two properties and enjoyed a bustling social life but decided to quit his job as a lift engineer in the heart of the capital three years ago.The 31-year-old said the daily commute and financial strain of living in London left him feeling tired and unfulfilled.He sold his house and buy-to-let flat to close his £400,000 mortgages and used the money he gained to buy a 18.5 acre plot of land in South Wales he found on eBay.After around 18 months of building the £4,000 building from natural materials, Kris says he is happier than hes ever been.He said: My family thought it was probably a little bit crazy. n the surface of everything I was doing quite well.

Mid-afternoon will see sunshine and isolated showers.“Temperatures in London with reach 26C, 22C in Cardiff and 20C in Glasgow with Belfast slightly warmer with 21C.“Thursday will be a dry day for most parts with a chance of showers in the east.“North West Scotland will be cloudy with rain late in the afternoon.“Glasgow will once again see temperatures of 20C while London could reach 28C or even 29C.

Demand has almost doubled in the last week with billions of litres of water being used on a daily basis by gasping homeowners.United Utilities director Martin Padley said: “Despite recent rain, reservoir levels are still lower than we expect.“Unless we get a period of sustained rainfall before August 5 these restrictions will help us safeguard essential water supplies.”United is said to waste 430million litres of water a day with leaks. GMB union chief Stuart Fegan said: “It’s a disgrace.”Paul Hickey, head of water resources, at the Environment Agency said: “Over two very dry months, we have seen a rapid decline in reservoir levels in the North West and we support the announcement by United Utilities to manage water supplies by introducing household restrictions.“Across the rest of England, most groundwater supplies are at healthy levels and water companies have enough water to maintain supplies if resources are managed properly.“Many rivers around the country have dropped to lower levels than normal for this time of year, which can be damaging to wildlife.We have robust plans in place to respond to these pressures and have stepped up our incident response as well as regulation of those abstracting water to ensure the environment is protected.“We are meeting with affected groups including farmers to provide practical advice about conserving water and planning for prolonged dry weather.We encourage everyone to use water wisely to conserve supplies and protect the environment.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000421102870.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"kids playground vandalised glass shards","story":"Unruly teenagers are wreaking havoc on the play area in Beccles, Suffolk, with intimidating behaviour and hordes of litter.Youngsters are now said to be too frightened to play there and parents fear kids will fall victim to the dangerous discarded glass.Beccles Bombles, the town’s volunteer litter picking group, cleaned up the area last week so kids could once again enjoy the swings and slides.They also stuck up anti-littering signs as a way to deter any repeat behaviour.But just one week on and the signs have been torn down, ripped up and burnt.

And it said the DWP should provide a figure for the total amount claimants have missed out on, along with an explanation of how it will provide “appropriate remedies”.The committee said: “There is clearly much more to be done to right this wrong. We encourage the department to act swiftly, decisively and comprehensively to address the harm caused by this mistake and, more broadly, to give much greater priority to correcting benefit underpayments to vulnerable people.”Those affected were people whose ability to work is affected by disability or illness, who were transferred from the old incapacity benefit on to ESA from 2011 onwards. Some 70,000 ended up being underpaid for years, losing an average of £5,000, found the report. Of these, more than 20,000 of those most in need are owed around £11,500 each and some as much as £20,000.The report found that the “unacceptable and entirely avoidable” situation came about because of “multiple failures” by the DWP. The department failed to listen to staff, claimants or experts when they warned that things were going wrong and failed to scrutinise its own processes properly or to ensure that they reflected the legislation, said the committee.And a “culture of indifference” at the department meant it took more than six years to take action, even though it was “painfully obvious” that a significant number of claimants were being underpaid.“Thousands of people have not received money essential for living costs because of Government’s blinkered and wholly inept handling of ESA,” said Ms Hillier.“The department simply didn’t listen to what claimants, experts, support organisations and its own staff were saying. Its sluggishness in correcting underpayments, years after it accepted responsibility for the error, points to weaknesses at the highest levels of management. Indifference has no place in the delivery of vital public services. It must be rooted out wherever it is found.“The department needs to explain what it is doing to improve both its management culture and its ability to gather and act promptly on critical intelligence.“It must also set out how it will more quickly address the £1.7 billion of underpayments claimants miss out on each year.”A DWP spokesman said: “We take the issue of underpayments very seriously and have actively taken steps to put this right as quickly as possible, to ensure people get the support they are entitled to. We have recruited 400 extra staff and have already started making payments - over £40 million so far. We have continued to provide regular updates to both the PAC and the House in regards to the progress of these repayments, and will continue in this stead.”In a separate development, the chairman of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee wrote to employment minister Alok Sharma to raise concerns over benefit sanctions data supplied by the DWP.Frank Field said that the department’s published data “consistently understate” the sanctions applied to claimants by removing those who have successfully appealed against decisions.And he queried the decision to sanction 1,108 Universal Credit claimants in February alone despite them being judged medically unfit to work or look for work.“What is the point of applying sanctions to people who cannot work and are not expected to look for jobs?” asked Mr Field. Benefit sanctions are the only major welfare reform this decade to have never been evaluated, and the picture DWP paints of the policy doesn’t match the troubling stories we’ve heard.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Virtually everyone, in other words.A moderator, sickeningly, tells an undercover reporter: “If you start censoring too much, people lose interest in the platform.

Blow after blow rains down on her authority. She is battered and bruised by her own party yet refuses to realise her time is up.The past few days have brought yet more resignations. Following the Foreign Secretary and the Brexit Secretary are ministers whose names escape me let’s call them Cuthbert, Dibble and Grubb.Though hardly well known, these MPs have grandly flounced off in protest at May’s handling of Brexit.In a particularly odd development, one is leaving the Government because he thinks the Government is not sticking to the spirit of government policy.All this on top of last week’s embarrassment, courtesy of Donald Trump. The President might have softened his comments about the Prime Minister and the “turmoil” afflicting the UK but the damage to May’s authority was done.God knows how this looks to the rest of the world. We used to bestride the international stage like a colossus now we stumble across it like Frank Spencer.The Prime Minister can’t take all the blame. She has been dealt a difficult hand — her party and the country split on Brexit, Europe turning the thumbscrews and Ukip waiting in the wings to hoover up Tory votes. It would be hard for any politician to make an outright success of this.But where Theresa May HAS failed categorically is on communicating her plans to the British people.The Chequers deal should have been a big moment. She should have been all over the TV stations selling this deal hard.In the past, prime ministers held public broadcasts to explain important matters to the people. Anthony Eden gave one on the Suez crisis, Harold Wilson on the devaluation of the Pound. Ted Heath warned in 1973 that the nation faced “the hardest Christmas that we have known since the war”.These leaders looked the nation in the eye, spoke directly to the British people — and LED.Theresa May, on the other hand, seems reluctant to get out and make the case for her own policy.Little wonder that two thirds of the public questioned on the Chequers deal were baffled by it. Confusion reigns.This points to a major problem with May’s premiership. She is hopeless at telling a national story.It’s the job of a leader not just to make decisions but to inspire the nation. For the person in No10, their words speak as loudly as their actions. They need to tell a compelling story about where Britain is going.Margaret Thatcher told the story of Britain emerging from the ashes of socialism thanks to the hard work and enterprise of its people: “A get-up-and-go instead of a sit-back-and-wait-for- it Britain.”Tony Blair told the story of Britain shrugging off the past and embracing the modern world: “A new Britain . . . a model 21st-century nation, based not on privilege, class or background, but on the equal worth of all.”David Cameron told the story of Britain clearing up the economic mess left by Labour, paying down our debts and living within our means.Love or loathe these leaders, at least they told a clear story about where Britain was going. We get none of this from May.She makes a virtue of just “getting on with the job”. But in a nation divided on Brexit, we desperately need more. We need a clear sense of direction for Britain’s future.Of course, the Prime Minister cannot last for much longer. In boxing terms she’s in the 12th round. Before long there will be a leadership contest — and those hoping to succeed May must learn from where she went wrong.The next resident of No10 must not only have the right policies but the right vision.If Britain is to regain its reputation abroad, and its self-respect at home, we urgently need a Prime Minister who inspires, who tells a national story — and who truly leads.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An independent panel later cleared him of the allegation and no further action was taken. Furious constituents have called for Griffiths to step down as an MP after he admitted to bombarding a pair of female constituents with sleazy messages. And today it emerged he had been accused by a Conservative councillor of being “very forward”, after he allegedly touched her knee and clutched her waist at a fundraising ball in September 2016. The councillor, Deneice Florence-Jukes, made a written complaint to Tory HQ, claiming she had been “completely humiliated and bullied” by Griffiths over several months, according to the . The complaint was reportedly referred to the party’s newly founded sexual harassment hotline in November last year. Mr Griffiths was made Minister for Small Business on January 10, while the investigation was still ongoing.  The inquiry was not dismissed until February, after Griffiths claimed it was “implausible” for him to have touched a colleague’s knee in a room full of people. He was cleared of wrongdoing. The alleged incident was initially reported to Richard Grosvenor, the Tory leader of East Staffordshire Borough Council. He told the Mirror: “Andrew’s got a problem which he’s seeking help for. I’ve got nothing but sympathy and compassion for him in that problem.” Mr Grosvenor said he had met with Ms Florence-Jukes after she made the allegation, saying she was in “floods of tears”. But referring to last weekend\u0027s sex texts revelations, he said Griffiths’ behaviour was “completely wrong” and he should step down as an MP. He said: “I do think Andrew has to consider his position. I don’t see how he can hope to meet with residents in a constituency MP capacity now. I just don’t know how that can happen to be honest.” "},{"url":null,"title":"barack obama takes thinly veiled","story":"NewsBarack Obama takes thinly-veiled swipe at Donald Trump as he warns against \u0027strongman politics\u0027 and \u0027liars\u0027The former US President did not name his successor but criticised the \"utter loss of shame among political leaders where they\u0027re caught in a lie\"\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByNatalie Evans01:33, 18 JUL 2018Updated04:32, 18 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Barack Obama took a thinly-veiled swipe at Donald Trump yesterday as he warned against the dangers of \u0027strongman politics\u0027.  The former President of the United States did not refer to his successor by name but said the world should resist cynicism over the rise of strongmen. The speech was among the most pointed comments he has made about politics since leaving office in January 2017. In a speech in Johannesburg to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of Nelson Mandela, Obama said: Just as people spoke about the triumph of democracy in the 90s, people now are talking about the triumph of tribalism and the strong man. But we need to resist that cynicism.  Some of Obama\u0027s language echoed that of Trump\u0027s critics. He continued: Too much of politics today seems to reject the very concept of objective truth. People just make stuff up. They just make stuff up. We see it in the growth of state sponsored propaganda. We see it in Internet-driven fabrications. We see it in the in the blurring of lines between news and entertainment. We see the utter loss of shame among political leaders where they\u0027re caught in a lie and they just double down and they lie some more. Let me say politicians have always lied but it used to be if you caught them lying, they\u0027d be like \u0027oh man\u0027. Now they just keep on lying.  Obama said there were far-right parties in the West that have platforms of protectionism and closed borders but also a barely hidden racial nationalism. Since leaving the White House, Obama has largely avoided direct involvement in US politics and has refrained from criticising Trump. Some Democrats say he should play a more direct role.   On Monday Trump sided with Russian President Vladimir Putin over alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, casting doubt on the findings of his own US intelligence agencies and sparking a storm of criticism at home.  During his speech, given in a stadium to thousands of politicians, businesspeople and students, Obama lauded Mandela\u0027s life of sacrifice and commitment to social justice.

The Prime Minister survived a bid by pro-EU MPs in her own party to change its post-Brexit trade strategy. They wanted the UK to join a customs union in the event it did not agree a free-trade deal with the EU. But on an evening of high drama in the House of Commons, MPs voted against the proposed amendment to the Trade Bill tabled by Tory MP Stephen Hammond. The Government scraped through by just 307 to 301 votes . Mrs May says a customs union would stop the UK from striking new trade deals. The win came thanks to Brexiteer Labour MPs Frank Field, Kate Hoey, John Mann and Graham Stringer siding with her. Had they voted against the Government, it would have triggered the vote of no confidence. Tory Brexiteer Nadine Dorries said tonight: “If Labour rebels hadn’t stepped in tonight, our own 12 Remain rebels would have lost us that vote.”  She added the third reading of the Trade Bill would have been “pulled” and a confidence vote would have been called tonight. This could have led to a general election within weeks – the third since 2015. Pro-EU Labour MP Chuka Umunna blasted the Labour four. He said: “It’s very disappointing and our communities will question why Labour MPs are jeopardising jobs.” Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas, a supporter of the People’s Vote campaign for a second referendum, said Brexit had “sunk further into the Westminster quagmire”. She said: “Parliament is deeply divided on Brexit and the Government are struggling to get anything passed. The only way forward is to put this issue to the public.” And Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said Mrs May’s Chequers negotiating strategy was now “in tatters”.  He added: “The passing of this deeply flawed bill can’t mask the profound splits at the heart of the Tory party.” Twelve Tory rebels broke ranks to back the customs union measure, even though it is understood Tory whips told would-be rebels of the confidence vote plan if it passed. In dramatic scenes in the Commons, ministers made a last-ditch effort to stave off defeat by offering to introduce amendments in the House of Lords. They said these would deal with “the essence” of rebel Tories’ concerns over future customs arrangements.  Mr Field, Ms Hoey, Mr Mann and Mr Stringer, along with independent MP Kelvin Hopkins, voted with the Government. Former Tory Defence Minister Guto Bebb, who only quit on Monday in protest at Government concessions to hard Brexit Tories, was among the 12 who rebelled. He was joined by Heidi Allen, Kenneth Clarke, Jonathan Djanogly, Dominic Grieve, Stephen Hammond, Phillip Lee, Nicky Morgan, Bob Neill, Antoinette Sandbach, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston. But despite her customs win, Mrs May faced humiliation as she lost two other battles. She had to ditch her bid to send MPs home early for summer after facing widespread fury. The Prime Minister had deployed the extraordinary tactic of bringing forward recess by five days in a bid to kill off threats to her premiership.  But Tory MP Nick Boles said: “There could hardly be a worse time to vote to start recess early.” And a Labour source said: “The Tories tried to save the PM’s skin with this Westminster ruse, but they have been forced into an embarrassing climbdown. That they even considered it shows what a shambles they’re in. This is Government in name only.” The Government also lost a separate vote on its Trade Bill on the regulation of medicines after Brexit. MPs backed an amendment by 305 to 301 that requires Mrs May to ensure the UK can continue to participate in the regulatory network operated by the European Medicines Agency.

Shambles is an overused word in politics, but over the past week the Tories have brought a whole new meaning to the word. At the start of the month, Cabinet ministers travelled to the Prime Minister’s country retreat finally to discuss their plan for Brexit. It had taken the Government two years to get that point. The plan then unravelled within a matter of days. Senior members of the Government resigned. Theresa May then sided with Jacob Rees-Mogg to kill it off.  And to top it all off, she tried to order her MPs to go home early for summer to avoid any further embarrassment. It would be funny if it wasn’t so serious. The question then turns to what Labour think of the Government’s plan. On that I have a very clear message for Theresa May – if you think Labour will support your fatally flawed Chequers’ agreement, then you have another thing coming. No ifs, no buts. Let me equally clear to Mirror readers – this is not about blocking Brexit or frustrating the process. We respect the result of the referendum and recognise we are leaving the EU. When we campaigned two years ago we did so on the basis that a vote to leave would mean leave - just as a vote to remain would have meant remain. But, we will not give this Prime Minister – or indeed any Tory Prime Minister – a blank cheque to harm British business, to put jobs at risk, to undermine people’s rights or to threaten the return of a hard border in Northern Ireland.

The new code states explicitly that “anti-Semitism is racism” and it is “unacceptable”, but stops short of signing up in full to the definition drawn up by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA).  At a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party on Monday, MPs and peers overwhelmingly backed calls for the full wording to be adopted.  Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis warned that adopting the code would “send an unprecedented message of contempt to the Jewish community”. But Labour’s National Executive Committee signed off the code at a meeting on Tuesday.

He said: “The argument that it is somehow incompatible with criticising the actions of the Israeli government is wrong. “The views of the vast majority of the Jewish community are very clear. I would urge the NEC to get on with this at speed.”  Chief Rabbi warns Labour’s new guidelines on anti-Semitism place it on the ‘wrong side of the fight’ against racism and intolerance Labour officials drew up the code in the wake of protests by Jewish groups outside Parliament earlier this year. It states that criticism of the state of Israel and its policies should not automatically be regarded as anti-Semitic, and makes clear that even “contentious” comments on this issue “will not be treated as anti-Semitism unless accompanied by specific anti-Semitic content ... or by other evidence of anti-Semitic intent”. The code explicitly endorses the IHRA’s working definition of anti-Semitism and includes a list of behaviours likely to be regarded as anti-Semitic copied word-for-word from the international organisation’s own document. But it omits four examples from the IHRA list.  These include accusing Jewish people of being more loyal to Israel than their home country, claiming that Israel’s existence as a state is a racist endeavour, requiring higher standards of behaviour from Israel than other nations and comparing contemporary Israeli policies to those of the Nazis. Labour insisted that while the examples are not reproduced word for word, they are covered in the new code. In a statement, the Jewish Labour Movement said: “The Labour Party has acted in a deliberate and offensive reckless manner in believing it understands the needs of a minority community better than the community itself.”  Labour Against Antisemitism said it was looking at its legal options and would be making a formal complaint to the party. Spokesman Euan Philipps said: “The message sent by the NEC is loud and clear: the Labour movement has lost its moral compass, appears to have an institutional anti-Semitism issue and can no longer claim to represent the values of solidarity, justice and equality.

Jess Park-Davies was excited to visit the island\u0027s thrilling glaciers and volcanoes with her school pals. But the 15-year-old\u0027s parents claim King Edward VI School, in Lichfield, Staffordshire, cancelled her ticket and said she could not go just a week before she was due to leave. Jess was left heartbroken and in tears after watching her friends go on the once-in-a-lifetime trip without her, her mum Helen told Birmingham Live.  The schoolgirl needs a nightly insulin injection for cystic fibrosis related diabetes, which she was diagnosed with in October 2016. Her family, from Lichfield, had agreed with King Edward VI School that she would self-administer her nightly insulin, despite a fear of needles, for a trial period to see if she would be able to do it on the five-day trip. Helen emailed the school to say the night before the deadline Jess was able to inject herself and - as a specialist nurse - considered her daughter now competent. But one day later, Jess’ parents were told she could not go.  Helen said: “This is so unfair. Jess is heartbroken. She was looking forward to going on this school trip and is devastated all her friends have gone without her. She has been crying since she heard the news. It is terrible.” Despite a meeting with the school and reassurances from her daughter\u0027s specialist cystic fibrosis and diabetes nurse as well as an email from her consultant, she claims the school still refused to allow the disappointed teenager to join her friends. Helen said: “The teachers on the trip did not want to have to give Jess any medicine whatsoever and said that, due to her age, it would be her responsibility, not theirs.  “I totally understand that, but when we did all we could to prove it would be safe, they still refused. “This has been awful for Jess and while she has missed her trip I want to make sure that they learn from this and don’t do this to any other child who suffers with cystic fibrosis or any other invisible illness.” Helen said health professionals informed the grammar school that Jess\u0027 insulin was taken to help her in the long term and would not need hospital treatment if she did not take it during the trip.

But parents face a 25% hike in prices if they still want to put the veg and salad staples on plates. Figures from purchasing company Beacon reveal farmers are facing a struggle to meet demand as the unusually high temperatures have wreaked havoc with crops. And cauliflower could also be hit as the scorching summer continues. Beacon managing director Paul Connelly said: “Although Brits might be enjoying the hot weather, our fresh produce definitely is not, with suppliers noting a decrease in quality stock, and therefore supply, which could see prices rise by 25%.  “With a simple summer salad a great dining choice in the hot weather, we may see an impact to consumers in the months to come if the sizzling summer continues, demand for produce increases and reduced supplies continue.” The predicted price rise follows reports that Britain also faces a pea shortage as the heat and lack of water is killing the growth and quality of pea pods. Stephen Francis, managing director of frozen supplier Fen Peas said: “It’s too late to rescue a lot of our peas, they overexerted themselves searching for water that’s not there. “All of our locations are harvesting below average.

The revamped recipe, which also has 10% less salt, now has 17g of sugar per 100g rather than 30g. Levels were already cut by 14% this year.  It puts the brand ahead of Government’s goal of 20% less sugar in cereal and snacks by 2020. Kellogg’s said it took three-and-a-half years to reformulate the recipe, which in taste tests 85% of children said they liked as much. Bridget Briggs, of Kellogg’s, said: “We have listened to people who buy Coco Pops.  We have taken sugar out and added more cocoa. We haven’t used artificial colours, sweeteners or preservatives.  My research and development team has been working hard to make sure that, by changing the recipe slightly, we can significantly reduce the total sugar content of the cereal without affecting its great chocolatey taste.

Yet instead of walking out on Anastasia \u0026shyPomiateeva, the 44-year-old astonishingly stood by his partner of nine years. But even worse was to come for Gary when dad Stephen suffocated his 62-year-old wife Anne after a blazing row over the secret fling. After the former UKIP councillor was today found guilty of murder, his son spoke about how the tangled web of infidelity, lies and tragedy ended with him and Anastasia forming a stronger bond than they had before.  Gary, who has disowned his scheming dad, said of the affair: “When I found out it was \u0026shyheartbreaking. I just couldn’t believe the man I absolutely \u0026shyidolised and worshipped had done something like that to me. “But me and Anastasia just love each other so much that if anything this has brought us closer together. We will be together for the rest of our lives, until we are old and grey. We have all done things in our lives we are not proud of. “At the end of the day we had already been through so much together.  “If this doesn’t break us we can overcome anything together. I haven’t got an old man any more for obvious reasons. “When my mum died I just felt numb. I had not only lost my mum but also my father as well, he was my best friend. “I would have done anything for him, it’s a huge betrayal.” Anastasia, who claimed Searle pursued her relentlessly until she gave in to his sordid advances, added: “I was relieved when it came out. I felt so ashamed and guilty. I want us to rebuild now the trial is over. Time is a healer.” The couple decided to speak out after being approached by the Daily Mirror.  Former Royal Marine Searle met Anastasia in 2005 when they worked together at Solar Bowl bowling alley where he was manager. In 2009 she began a relationship with Gary, after he also got a job there. The couple had three children and Anastasia was treated as a daughter-in-law by Searle and Anne. In March last year Searle invited her for coffee at his UKIP office in the council building at Ipswich, Suffolk. During the visit he told her he had not had sex for six years and asked if she would like to “make him happy”. Anastasia, who was born in Britain but has a Russian father, refused and left. But dad-of-three Searle continued harassing her – using bodybuilding pictures from his youth – and in April she “relented”.  Anastasia said: “When he approached me I was shocked and surprised. But at the time I was very vulnerable because my nan was really unwell in hospital. “I had always been \u0026shyintimidated by him as he’s very powerful, controlling and manipulative. “I was a prat to give in but he took advantage of my vulnerability and I felt sorry for him.” The fling began when Anastasia visited Searle at his family home in Stowmarket. She said he gave her the nickname SBG – short for Steve’s Beautiful Girl. The lovers exchanged explicit pictures and texts. Anastasia added: “Whenever I tried to break it off he said that he needed me. I felt dirty, I always had to have a shower straight after meeting him.”  The two-month affair ended last June when suspicious Anne guessed her husband’s phone PIN was 4545 – after he served in 45 Commando – and spotted the exchanges. She discovered they were trying to arrange a hotel meeting and confronted Searle. Giving evidence at Ipswich crown court during his trial, he said: “I was a stupid old sod and made a massive mistake. “I totally admitted everything. She [Anne] was extremely upset, that goes without saying.” Anastasia confessed everything to Gary. She said: “I wanted him to know the truth, I wanted him to know everything.”  The court heard that the messy affair ripped the Searle family apart. Gary, who has two brothers, Stephen Jr, 29, and 41-year-old \u0026shyChristopher, broke off contact with his dad. But despite the turmoil he caused, \u0026shydetermined Searle continued trying to contact Anastasia, even “stalking her” and following her to \u0026shysupermarkets and baby groups. She also found out he had been obsessed with her for years, even compiling a sick photo collection on his computer. Anastasia said: “He had pictures of me from before I met Gary stored on his computer. “He had downloaded them from Facebook and superimposed my head on to the bodies of porn stars. I was scared of him. Me and Gary changed our numbers to stop him contacting us.”  The court heard Searle’s fling with Anastasia led to tragedy on December 30 last year, when Searle had the murderous row with Anne. After smothering his wife of 45 years, he phoned police and told them: “I’ve just killed my wife.” He claimed he strangled sushi factory worker Anne in self-defence after she attacked him with a steak knife at their \u0026pound320,000 home. But jurors rejected his concocted story and took just three and a half hours to convict him of murdering her with a choke hold he learned during military training. Searle, recently diagnosed with prostate cancer, held his head in his hands following the verdict. He had asked to attend today’s sentencing hearing via videolink from HMP Norwich, complaining about the “unpleasant” prison van journey. But the judge insisted he be in court. Searle, who had a nine-year military career, will be jailed for life on Wednesday at Ipswich.

Last week eagle-eyed fashion fans poured over her four fabulous outfits during their whirlwind tour of Ireland. Today they can\u0027t help but admire her pink trench coat dress by House of Nonie. The \u0026pound623 sleeveless dress has captured the attention of many, and not just because she looks gorgeous in it. Meghan\u0027s dress is gaining attention because it\u0027s the latest in a string of blush coloured outfits the Duchess has worn since marrying Prince Harry. In fact, it is the fifth time she\u0027s worn pink.  She has previously worn similar shades to events such as Trooping the Colour, Prince Charles\u0027 70th birthday party, the Queen\u0027s Young Leaders Awards and to celebrate the Queen\u0027s 92nd birthday. Experts have highlighted the shift in her wardrobe, pointing out how before becoming a Duchess, Meghan opted for darker, bolder colours. However she has noticeably started wearing more neutral, softer tones - and there\u0027s an interesting reason why.   Colour psychologist, Karen Haller, told MailOnline that the colour is calming.  She said: The number of high profile engagements Meghan has had since officially becoming a member of the royal family would no doubt be quite nerve wracking. As the softer end of the pink spectrum is physically soothing, it\u0027s the perfect antidote to calming those nerves and easing the pulse rate.  Karen added that the colour could also reflect Meghan\u0027s feelings for Harry. Soft pinks communicate the nurturing, compassionate, caring side of love, she said. I\u0027m not at all surprised she is feeling this way given the body language between her and Prince Harry - and she is reflecting this in picking the softer pinks.

No other planet in the Solar System has so many satellites. One of the 12 is described by scientists as an oddball because of its unusual and risky orbit. The renegade moon has an inclined orbit that crosses those of others moving in the opposite direction, greatly increasing the possibility of a collision. This is an unstable situation, said US astronomer Dr Scott Sheppard, from the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington DC, who led the discovery team.  A head-on collision between two moons would grind the objects down to dust, he added. Nine of the new moons belong to an outer retrograde swarm circling against the direction of Jupiter\u0027s rotation. Others including the oddball are prograde moons travelling with the planet\u0027s spin. The oddball is thought to be Jupiter\u0027s smallest moon, having a diameter of less than a kilometre. Scientists believe it could be the last remaining remnant of a once larger moon that was involved in past collisions. The name Valetudo has been suggested for it, after the Roman god Jupiter\u0027s great-granddaughter, the goddess of health and hygiene.

Leighanne Bromley, 29, was appalled to overhear staff members at RNIB Three Spires Academy in Coventry mocking her son and sharing cruel jokes. She had called the school to notify them that her 10-year-old son would be off that day as he had a cold, but wasn\u0027t prepared for the response that she got once the school thought they had hung up. Leighanne phoned the school on July 10 in the morning after her son Harley had complained he wasn\u0027t feeling well. Shortly after she saw she had a voicemail from the school after they had called back.  She said: I looked at my phone I saw I had a missed call from the school and they’d left the voicemail. “It was then I heard the message. My initial reaction was just shock. My jaw just hit the floor, I was stunned. I couldn’t make it out at first, so I had to listen to it over and over again. I was just in disbelief.” In the voicemail recording, a female member of staff can be heard asking when Harley would be returning to school. Appearing to think she had hung up the phone, she can then be heard saying ‘and make sure he’s off all f***king week’ while another voice asks ‘what about two weeks?’ The staff members can then be heard joking about the possibility of Harley being kept off for two weeks or until the end of the year. A final voice then makes reference to the upcoming summer holidays, retorting ‘don’t bring him back until the 27th of July when we are closed’. The retail worker and mum-of-one, from Cheylesmore, Coventry, said she is now fearful to send Harley back to the school and wants the staff members to be suspended.  Robert Jones, headteacher of Three Spires, where half of pupils have autistic spectrum conditions, has made a public apology to Leighanne today and has launched an investigation. Leighanne said she has never previously had problems with the school, which Harley has attended as a pupil for the last four and a half years. But she admitted recently she has felt staff were unsympathetic in dealing with Harley’s behavioural issues. Leighanne said Harley, who was diagnosed with an autistic spectrum disorder aged four-and-a-half in 2013 and has a developmental delay, is a “sweet” boy. She said: “When he first attended my impression was that it was a really good school and that he was progressing really well. “The school is good itself but there have been issue with the staff. They’ve had a few behavioural issues with Harley but they just don’t seem to have sympathetic. “I think the school have been weak in dealing with this. Obviously if I don’t get the outcome I’m looking for I might have to move him.

William Powner bullied, blackmailed and intimidated his nine victims, some as young as 12, so they felt forced to engage in sexual activity and send him pictures and videos of the intimate acts. Powner, of Fitzwaller Road, Woolston, Warrington, was just 13 when he began committing his cyber sex crime.  He was 17 upon his conviction and 18 when he was sentenced today. Powner, who was recently diagnosed with autism and Asperger\u0027s syndrome, avoided an immediate jail term.  He was made the subject of a 10 year Sexual Harm Prevention Order that means his behaviour will be monitored by the authorities, the Liverpool Echo reported.  The sex pest used Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat to snare his victims, with police estimating he was in touch with up to 85 separate children, Chester Crown Court heard. Describing some of the abuse, prosecutor Simon Parry said: The suspect [Powner] with his [computer] camera pane deactivated, will tell the victims that he is a female teenager. The suspect will engage in conversation and quickly turn it sexual. Requests are made for exposed chest and face shots, then footage of the victims’ penis and in return and only when this has been done will she return the ‘favour’ and show her face and body. There are many little comments of confidence, flattery and it can be seen that this is being done to ‘hook the victim in’. Once the victim had shown their genitalia or performed a sex act on camera, Mr Parry said, Powner turned nasty.  He would tell his victim the footage was recorded and he knew where they lived, and that if they did not do what he said the footage would be shared with teachers, parents, bullies, and friends. Mr Parry added: In a number of the files, the suspect coerces the victim to stand naked in the room, open their bedroom door and to call their mum up so he can watch it happen. The victims’ body language is completely revealing that he is now acting under extreme duress due to the threats. In another, the victim is made to carry his device downstairs, and whilst still naked, go outside into the back garden. Powner, who had no previous convictions, was also found to have a collection of indecent images of children, with 110 of the most serious Category A movie and photos, 137 in Category B and 73 in Category C.

Some of these encounters - such as Robert Mugabe, Bashar al-Assad - have been divisive to say the least. Last week, Her Majesty once again had to shake hands with another controversial figure - Donald Trump. While our famously private Queen has to remain diplomatic and smilingly neutral at all times, she\u0027s still got her own subtle, shady ways of communicating her feelings.  And as Britain\u0027s longest-reigning monarch, she has this down to a fine art - you just have to know where to look for the signs. Luckily, thanks to brains behind Her Majesty\u0027s Jewllery Vault , eagle-eyed twitter user Julie spotted how the Queen (possibly) sent some powerful yet subtle messages to Trump during his visit using her brooches.  And these weren\u0027t I think you\u0027re great, Donny messages, either. No. The Queen of Shade? First, it\u0027s important to to realise the significance of brooches for the Queen. According to Julie, she gets them frequently as gifts and when she chooses to wear one on an official engagement, there is always a significance to the choice of brooch. While this can be a thoughtful or historically significant gesture, it can also be used to show, for example, disdain.  Julie explains: A head of state gives her a brooch? If they visit, she\u0027ll wear it or something else she\u0027d been given by them as a gift. (This goes for other kinds of jewelry too.) To her it\u0027s almost like royal orders. She continues: That said, she wore three brooches while she and Trump were both in town. The day he arrived, the day of the banquet, and the day she actually met him for tea. Possible snub number one? Arrival day was the one that got the most attention. That day, she wore the brooch the Obamas gave her on their last visit to England. Hmm, interesting. Now, this is potentially significant and a snub for the following reasons.   It was purchased out-of-pocket by Michelle and Barack Obama and given to her as a personal gift. According to Julie they chose a very modest pin made of very modest materials. The message is \u0027Here is a gift of something you like, with only sentimental value because it\u0027s for friendship not state visits.\u0027 The Queen has been given jewellery from the US over the years. But she chose the most SENTIMENTAL piece in the collection, the one that was given OUT OF FRIENDSHIP WITH THE OBAMAS AS PEOPLE.  Possible snub number two? The next day the Queen had an audience with the King and Queen of Belgium, for which she chose to wear a brooch gifted to her by Canada.    Julie goes on: You know, who Trump\u0027s been screaming about and insulting. The commonwealth country and one of the UK\u0027s greatest allies. Them. Coincidence? Maybe. But let\u0027s move on to the next brooch. Possible snub number three? On the day of her tea with Trump and Melania, the Queen chose a brooch she inherited from her mother.

And sometimes it can be just as hard to say no to seconds if that first bowl didn\u0027t quite hit the spot. But a new study shows we actually need to be very careful with certain desserts if we\u0027re planning to drive afterwards, especially if you live in Scotland.  A number of puddings which include alcohol actually contain enough booze to put you over the limit if you have more than one slice, reports the Daily Record .    The research shows two portions of the popular Italian dessert tiramisu - which normally contains two tablespoons of brandy, Tia Maria or Ameretto , sometimes all three - could put you over the limit.  Fans of the coffee-flavoured dessert, translated from Italian as \u0027pick me up\u0027 or \u0027lift me up\u0027, are being warned to stick to one portion or face being hauled over for drink driving. The limit in Scotland is now 22 micrograms in 100ml of breath, compared to 35 micrograms in the rest of the UK. But that\u0027s not the only pudding you need to be careful with. Other desserts on the warning list include trifles, which normally contain about 100ml of cherry brandy (but you\u0027ll need to eat a whole eight-person trifle to get close to the limit) and Christmas pudding which contains an average of 150ml of brandy, sherry, whisky or rum.  But you\u0027ll need to have about five slices of the festive treat to put you in danger. Boozy chocolates filled with alcohol - like Bailey\u0027s mini delights or cherry liquors - can also put you over the limit. But you\u0027d need to scoff 850 to end up with a drink driving conviction, so we imagine you\u0027re probably okay... It\u0027s not just desserts which are a danger, with hot sauce, orange juice, peppercorn sauce and chicken marsala on the \u0027no go list\u0027.

Despite the prospect of new employment, a number of neighbouring businesses had voiced their concerns about the proposals.Plans were initially drawn-up to convert the existing bar into a convenience store with an instore bakery.The proposals, submitted on behalf of the club by Peter Inglis Architects, also featured 28 parking spaces for players and match officials, cutting down on parking in residential areas.As well as potentially creating a number of jobs, the proposals would have played a vital part in securing the club’s long-term future.The club spokesman said that already this year it had welcomed dance studio Addicted2Dance into a section of the facilities at Balgowan Avenue.Now, as the club gears up for the new season, he said there were proposals to convert part of the social club to the benefit of the club and the players.He said: “We can reveal that any proposals to put a convenience store at the football club are off the table.“We had a club meeting regarding the matter last week but we can’t divulge too much at this stage.“We will be holding further discussions with Dundee City Council.“All we can advise is that any further proposal will be for the benefit of the club and the players.“We have recently welcomed a new dance studio into part of the premises here within the last three months.“At this stage we cannot comment any further on the matter until we speak with Dundee City Council.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b45cc51a376d-846x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people asda ace jim checks out for the last time","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAsda Ace Jim Dodds has checked out of work for the last time.Jim was a war baby born in 1941 but 77 years later the former roofer is only just putting his feet up.The great-grandfather started his working life in Dundee’s jute mills before becoming a roofer.He even helped to build his future workplace at Asda Kirkton more than 40 years ago.Jim and his wife Patricia, of Whitfield, have four daughters and two sons.Their family also now includes 15 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.One of Jim’s daughters, Debbie, even followed in his footsteps when she also became an Asda Ace and went on to work on the checkouts.Jim spent 15 years as an Asda Ace and for the last few years has been responsible for keeping the bakery and deli in tip-top condition.Samantha Will, community champion at Asda Kirkton, organised a special retirement lunch for the much-loved colleague.Jim was given a new set of wheels – in the shape of an inflatable walking frame.Debbie said: “My dad doesn’t actually want to give up work but it is time for him to go.“He was surprised by the retirement lunch – he didn’t think they were going to do anything for him.“My dad has never been unemployed.

However, it wasn’t to be as while he rummaged in his bag to find the ring, he was interrupted by a group of German tourists.With the mood killed, they went to the beach, but after sunbathing for just 10 minutes, Craig said they should go back to the hotel because he was too hot.He chose the balcony of their room which overlooked the lake to ask Aimee to become his wife.Aimee couldn’t even answer and instead simply burst into tears of happiness.After careful planning by the couple, the morning of the wedding arrived and the sun was shining.Aimee said: “When I woke up and saw the sun I was so happy that I was getting my outdoor wedding.“It made the photos taken by Burfly Photography from the day look really green and beautiful.“We had a flower wall created by Celebre which was stunning and it would have been a beautiful backdrop for the ceremony too.”The bride was accompanied down the aisle by stepdad Graham and the ceremony conducted by humanist Neil Anderson was the highlight of the day.“We made sure that the ceremony wasn’t boring and it was very personal,” said Aimee.“Neil was absolutely incredible and delivered our story in a fun way.“The night-time reception was brilliant but the day-time was our highlight.”The pair took to the floor to have their first dance as a married couple to The Verve’s hit song Lucky Man, which was performed by band Paper Tiger.Craig and Aimee would like to thank their wedding planners Katy and Fiona, videographers I Do, bridal shop Annarose and all their family and friends.Aimee added: “I wouldn’t change a thing about my wedding.

We trained twice on Friday so there were heavy legs,” he said.“I think we have to play quicker football, especially in the front. We kept the ball too long in the midfield.“And I think it is more important for that, although some people will be disappointed with the result, we look at some of the decisions we made in the game.“We had 1-0 and the game in hand. Then we make a mistake and let them back in.”Csaba, though, remains confident a team he is still building will come together over the next few weeks.“I have to say this team needs a little bit of patience and time. We are not finished with the recruitment.“We’ve got Adam Barton now and we need definitely one player more in the central defence and also a striker.”Barton signed up on a two-year deal from Partick Thistle, who agreed to cancel his contract and let him head for United as part of the cost-cutting process they’ve implemented in the wake of relegation from the Premiership.That left Csaba delighted to snatch a player from an outfit who could be among his big rivals in the league campaign.“I am very happy that Adam has made the decision to come to us because he is a player who can play in central midfield and also in the centre of the defence.”Meanwhile, United pair James Keatings and Paul McMullan have been linked with moves away.Former club Hamilton are reported to be keen on Keatings, while Partick Thistle are said to want former Celtic wide man McMullan at Firhill.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"former celtic man toshney completes move from dundee united to arbroath","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United defender Lewis Toshney has completed a loan move to Arbroath.The versatile defender has joined the Lichties until January.The 26-year-old Dundonian, who began his career at Celtic,  has also played for Ross County, Cowdenbeath and Raith Rovers as well as having loan spells at Kilmarnock and Dundee.Toshney, who has represented Scotland at Under 17, Under 19 and Under 21 levels, joined Dundee United from Raith Rovers and made his debut at Arbroath\u0026#8217s Gayfield ground in the Betfred Cup in July 2016.He was absent from Saturday\u0026#8217s 1-1 draw with Arbroath at Tannadice which saw the visitors win a bonus point after a 5-3 on penalty shoot out win in the opening game of  the Betfred Cup.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b4c5d1fbe2e3-480x564.jpg ","title":"neil mccann hails super stop from keeper jack hamilton on dundee debut","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee boss Neil McCann hailed the stopping power of new goalie Jack Hamilton as he claimed a debut clean sheet.By the end of their 4-0 victory at Stirling Albion which started their Betfred Cup campaign, the Dark Blues were cruising to victory.However, with the game at 0-0 and 1-0, the League Two side had chances to turn the game their way.Their best effort came from the head of Jason Marr shortly after half-time but his powerful effort was well saved by new boy Hamilton with the keeper up quickly again to stop the rebound.After that Sofien Moussa added his second of the game before debutant Jean Mendy and Craig Wighton goals capped a good start to the season for Dundee.Boss Neil said: “I’m delighted, absolutely delighted.“I said before the game that this was the season started for real now, there’s no more warm-ups.“First of all, you want to win the game and then, afterwards, put on a bit of a show and score some goals so I’m pleased we did that.“Stirling made it really difficult at times and it took a brilliant double stop from big Jack Hamilton, which is exactly why we brought him to the club. When he wasn’t used that much he makes a super stop at 1-0. We got a wee bit of a jolt and away we went.“I’m really pleased, clean sheet, four goals and the front three scoring – I’m delighted.“We were trying to work the ball through the middle of the park, the boys coming in for their competitive debuts looked good as well so, all in all, I’m pleased.”As well as Hamilton and Mendy, there also were debuts for Nathan Ralph and Elton Ngwatala from the start with the latter replaced by another new boy Karl Madianga.And Neil was happy to see them all make an impact, Mendy especially as he got off to a goalscoring start.“He’s direct and the most important thing for me is he has an end product,” the Dens gaffer added.“His finish was actually brilliant, he reversed it into the corner and you can see he’s got that eye for goal.“He’s really intelligent, he’s not a young boy we’ve brought in or somebody at the twilight of his career – he’s at a real good age.“Elton showed real good glimpses of his power and pace. He’s going to be great and he’s physically able to deal with the game here. Karl came on and showed glimpses as well.

sheltered accommodation was almost evicted after benefits bureaucrats sent housing payments to Angus Council by mistake.The vulnerable woman, who was living in an Angus Housing Association (AHA) property in the city, was wrongly accused of avoiding more than £1,000 in payments to her landlords.It later emerged her entitled housing benefits had been sent to the similarly named – but wholly unconnected – local authority.AHA said it was forced to take legal action which could have seen the woman turfed out on to the street because of the lack of payments.The firm was only able to get to the bottom of the mess following a last- minute intervention by the organisation’s welfare reform officer.It is understood the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will have to apply to Angus Council to get the money back.Bruce Forbes, director of the association, said the roll-out of the controversial Universal Credit had been “shambolic”.He praised staff at the Dundee office who have worked closely with the association in the past, but said the centralisation of services in England – and the faceless nature of the now online process – had led to the current “mess”.He said: “Our staff have had numerous examples of tenants’ housing costs being sent to another landlord, despite the DWP having been given email verification of the rent being charged by us as the correct landlord.”Mr Forbes urged any tenants getting rent arrears letters from their landlords to make contact to ensure that their Universal Credit is being properly

path for pedestrians","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA project to upgrade a cycle route linking Dundee with Broughty Ferry is now under way and could be ready by the end of the year.This time last year, Dundee City Council received an £800,000 match funding package from the European Regional Development Fund to help make the city greener.Part of the cash was set aside for improvements to cycling links between the city centre and Broughty Ferry.The tender to improve the route – stretching from East Camperdown Street to Stannergate Road – has now been published on Scotland’s public contracts website.Already part of the National Cycle Network Route 1, parts of the path are patchy and closed off to pedestrians with buzzer-operated gates.As well as upgrading the rougher patches of the path, the route will be widened to accommodate pedestrians as a “shared use” path.Similar efforts have been carried out along Riverside Drive as part of the recent flood prevention works.Cyclist Roddy Isles, who uses the route frequently, said the improvements would be “welcome”.He said: “I use this route quite a lot and the council had consulted on potentially opening the route up to pedestrians.“At the moment you have to buzz at the gate and it lets you through if you’re on a bike.“It’s a welcome proposal, but my only concern would be mixing pedestrians and cyclists.“There would need to be clear separation.”An explanatory note included with the tender said the successful bidder would be creating a “designated cycle/pedestrian route”.A bidder is expected to be chosen by the end of August.Work is then expected to get underway on the route by mid-September and completed within six weeks – meaning the route could be ready to use by the end of October.Dundee City Council was one of five organisations in Scotland sharing in the European funding pot totalling £3.25 million.And the City Quay project is one of several which is being undertaken by the city council to improve infrastructure for cyclists and discourage heavy car use.Works are ongoing on the Kingsway to build pedestrian-operated crossings linking streets south of the carriageway with Caird Park, funded by the Scottish Government.The council has also been given a £50,000 grant by transport body Sustrans to develop a cycling scheme called Northern Links, linking the city’s further-out communities with the centre and waterfront.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b4dba920b751-752x564.jpg ","title":"xplore dundee buses drafted in for the

What will happen is that one person turns up and uses it and then another and another.\"We have had one wee lad learn to ride his bike here as he was too frightened to learn anywhere else. We have had people playing Frisbee.\"A lot of people from the Highland Council offices have being coming here for lunch and Cheshire House have twice been here with a group of their people.\"Many have said they have been here for events but find it is a completely different place when it is a piece of grass. They are loving it and enjoying the peace and quiet.\"Others have used it as a thoroughfare as part of their daily commute while the Northern Constabulary Pipe Band also took the opportunity to hold its rehearsals in the park one evening.The idea of a community buyout is being driven by the Northern Counties Cricket Club, one of the park\u0027s main users.Mr Ford, who is a club member, believes such a move will be good for the club, the community and Inverness \u0026ndash and the buildings which are deteriorating.\"Without investing time and money, they could be mothballed and if that happens, we would not be able to use the park,\" he said.\"To me, a community buyout is common sense.

He has also raised concerns at Westminster about such firms on several occasions.He said: \"People should not be charged inflated fees when they have paid for parking in good faith.\"The British Parking Association confirmed to me in person it is their view that people should not be charged if they have made an error inputting their registration.\"This guidance must be heeded by parking operators and, where it is not, there needs to be greater enforcement.\"He added: \"It is high time that operators like Smart Parking were removed from our city centres once and for all.\"The MP was responding to the case of Roger High, from Nottinghamshire, who failed to persuade Smart Parking to overturn a charge issued to him and will now have to cough up \u0026pound100.He said: \"In my appeal I explained that I had transposed two of the letters [in my registration number] and the fact that the registration number was so similar to my postcode that it was easy to make such a small slip.\"I was appalled and livid to receive an email rejecting my appeal, even though they acknowledged that I had purchased a car parking ticket, on the grounds that I had not purchased it for the correct registration number.\"Visiting the area frequently to see family, Mr High insisted Smart Parking\u0027s actions \"would not change\" his love of this part of the world.However, he revealed the experience had left him \"miserable and depressed as well as outraged\".Highland Council trading standards officer William Paul, who has been involved in long-running discussions with Smart Parking, said he was surprised to hear about Mr High\u0027s problems, believing there had been positive changes at the site.It is understood ticket machine key pads have been made bigger to reduce the chance of errors and new software aims to eliminate charges being issued when easily detectable genuine mistakes are made.\"We are encouraged by recent improvements in the operating procedures of the car park and to be fair to the company, these improvements do seem to be making a difference,\" he said.\"We are assured that these improvements are based on a firm commitment to resolve the previous reported issues, including incorrect vehicle registration mark (VRM) entries.\"He encouraged any drivers affected by charge notices to follow Smart Parking\u0027s appeals system and, if necessary, report the matter via the Citizens Advice Consumer Service on 03454 040506 or at www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/consumerA spokesman for Smart Parking said: \"It is a contractual requirement for motorists to input their correct registration mark when parking at Strothers Lane Car park and failure to do so is a breach of the terms and conditions of parking there which can result in a Parking Charge Notice being issued.\"However Smart Parking acknowledges that motorists can make minor mistakes when entering their registration and as such working closely with Highland Trading Standards, has put in place measures to try to identify genuine mistakes against actual registration marks using the car park. Where the mistake is minor and the actual registration mark can be cross referenced Smart parking will endeavour to identify this and not issue the Parking Charge notice.\"Motorists are encouraged to double check their registration number before entering it and if those using the car park have entered a registration mark and subsequently received a Parking Charge Notice they are encouraged to engage with Smart Parking through our British Parking Association accredited appeals process.\"Wednesday 18 Jul 2018 8:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116630.jpg","title":"Schoolgirls inspiring bid to wipe out racism","story":"\u0026nbspA DETERMINED eight-year-old has been praised after taking an inspirational stand against racism in her community by personally removing a vile message she found defacing a local mural.Breagha Gowans spotted the anti-Muslim slur scribbled on the wall of an underpass near Culloden Wood while out for a walk with her mother Michelle.After the pair had a chat about what exactly the message \u0026ndash which the Courier will not print \u0026ndash meant, the youngster decided to step up and take it upon herself to erase it, gathering a bag full of cleaning equipment for the job.\"I wanted to clean up the graffiti because I have a friend at school who is Muslim and I didn\u0026rsquot want her to be upset,\" she said.\"I wanted to be kind towards others.\"The underpass where Breagha spotted the graffiti passes below Barn Church Road and is covered in a colourful mural in a deliberate bid to dissuade would-be vandals from defacing the walls.After scrubbing the wall clean again, she appealed to everyone to show more respect towards those around them.\"Please don\u0026rsquot do it because it is hateful and no-one likes bullies,\" she said.\"It isn\u0026rsquot good to hurt people\u0027 feelings and I didn\u0026rsquot like to see something that would make someone feel bad.\"Breagha\u0027 father is Inverness South councillor Ken Gowans who said he was proud of the way she had decided to tackle the problem head-on.\"I told her it was fantastic \u0026ndash though like a typical eight-year-old she was off doing something else,\" he said.\"Breagha and her class have been learning about different religions at Inshes Primary School and she has a very strong sense of justice and fairness.\"It is a testament to what they are teaching in school.

that.“Many people have happy memories of fun times here but it’s time to bring something new to Aberdeen and the very best we can offer in terms of a clubbing experience.“We want to thank everyone who came out to say a fond farewell to the Institute but now we’re focusing on spending the summer transforming the place to reopen as ATIK, with Vinyl and Curve.”The new nightspot will have three distinct rooms with ATIK showcasing light and sound technology, Vinyl aimed at those who enjoy classic pop and Curve which will play the latest RnB chart hits.Ruth added: “We can’t wait to deliver a fantastic venue and nights out for existing and new customers.“We’ve more than doubled the number of booths and we’ve got some fun touches including inflatable guitars and dress-up items in Vinyl to make every night a party night.”In disco-themed Vinyl, five of the VIP areas will have their own private flashing dance floor.The club, which will have a capacity of 1,540, is also looking for 30 new

principle for a £200 million development of the mall in Aberdeen.Under the plans – which were first tabled in February 2016 – there would be space for 30 new retailers and a 120-bedroom hotel.Bosses had also proposed providing an extra 1,000-space car park, understood to be a multi-storey.However, in their report, planners have limited this to an additional 294 parking spaces, above the existing 1,119, in a bid to prevent problems on the surrounding road network.In approving the application, planners said the application would “promote vitality and viability” in the city centre.Ryan Manson, general manager of Union Square, said: “We are pleased with the council’s decision to approve the application, one which aligns with the aspirations of the Aberdeen City Centre Masterplan (CCMP).“The approval provides a statement of confidence in Aberdeen’s long-term future as a leading retail destination and the potential to continue to offer new and exciting retailers and restaurants alongside expanding our leisure provision within the city.“We look forward to continuing to work with our customers, Aberdeen City Council, and all of our stakeholders.”The extension would be built into the current surface car park and stretch along Market Street.The shopping centre’s floorspace would increase 280m2 to 27,870m2 under the proposals.Hammerson, owners of the site, said in a planning statement from two years ago that the development would see the demolition of part of the existing retail park, to be replaced by an extension to the existing centre.This would house shops, and restaurants, along with providing a number of “leisure uses”.Bosses have said the design is yet to be finalised.Further detailed planning applications are expected to come forward revealing details of the scheme.A public consultation carried out in 2015 on the plans revealed a design around a maritime theme was the preferred option.The centre has been told by planners to carry out improvements to the pedestrian route between Union Square and the city centre, costed at £546,000, along with a cycle hub and improvements to the bus station.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"plans lodged to build new

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities.

A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

The Black Bull on River Street was first opened in 1754 and has survived many turmoils in its time, including a blaze that broke out in 2014. But last Thursday, workers were told mid-shift to collect their belongings and leave, with the tenant having been given no warning of the foreclosure. Now, employees have joined a hospitality union to fight for what they are owed – and their boss has stated “they will get paid”. Day-shift manager, 23-year-old Charlotte Forsyth, was mid-shift when the pub’s owners, Rosemount Taverns, marched in and said they were shutting up shop. Charlotte told the Post: “I was in for about two hours and the head from Rosemount Taverns turned up and said: ‘I need the keys – I’m changing the locks, my joiner’s on his way.’  “I was crying and everything. “I’ve only be there for just over a month and I’ve not been paid a penny. “I still have bills to pay like everybody else. “I would not have left a stable job had I thought that in a month I’d be talking about signing on – it’s not on. Tenant Scott Burnell, of Glasgow, claimed he knew nothing about the decision to close and confirmed staff will receive outstanding wages. Mr Burnell said: “It wasn’t my decision at all – the pub company wanted to (close). “It came as a shock to me – I didn’t know anything about it until after it had actually happened.  “The wages haven’t come through yet – it’s a four-week cycle. “They were paid two weeks ago and they’ll be due to get paid in two weeks’ time – and they will be paid. “I’ll be 100 per cent honest – I’m going to have to find that money from somewhere else.” Furious workers took to social media to vent their anger after receiving information that claimed Mr Burnell had previously outed other workers of a job and money. Mr Burnell denied the claims and said: “I know what they’re saying on Facebook and that is not the case at all. “I don’t set out to rip anybody off – I had no idea that pub was closing yesterday. “Pubs do run into trouble – it happens – I’m not going to run away from this.”  Distraught barmaid and mum-of-two Dianne McConnachie said: “I’ve got children to feed and a roof to put over my head. “I live in a private let with a private landlord so I can be punted out any time. “Myself and colleague Jade are single parents – we’re the only people bringing money into our houses. “So what do we do? Do we go and sign on?” Boss Mr Burnell added: “The pub was closed down because it was losing so much money. “It was a disaster in terms of the administration and financial control of the pub from the management. “I think the level of incompetence and mismanagement was horrific.  “And then we discovered they’d been buying stuff on credit. There’s nothing wrong with that, that wasn’t their fault but I found another \u0026pound4000 in credit that hadn’t been paid for – it was absolutely out of control. “I was told on Friday morning the debt to the brewery was \u0026pound720 and by Tuesday afternoon, it had risen to \u0026pound4000. “It didn’t make any sense. “I’ve got a list of about \u0026pound500/ \u0026pound600 of advances paid out so they were not telling you that. “I know it looks bad for me and I’m prepared to accept that, but it’s not as black and white.”  Bryan Simpson, Unite Hospitality Organiser said: “This is not the first time that Scott Burnell has tried to cut and run with his workers’ hard-earned wages, but it will certainly be the last. “As the Director of Wire Inns, Idlewild and The Raven Hotel, he already owes thousands of pounds to former workers in unpaid wages. “Unite will continue to support our members at the Black Bull to get what they’re entitled to. “We have received assurances from the leaseholders of the pub – Rosemount Taverns – that as soon as they find new tenants for the pub they will endeavour to keep the staff in their jobs.” Rosemount Taverns were unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12468674.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_240218grant_07JPG.jpg","title":"maybole super school one step","story":"NewsMaybole super-school is one step closer to being builtCouncillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson15:27, 10 JUL 2018NewsNew Carrick Academy artist impression (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA \u0026pound42million super-school has taken a step closer to being built in Maybole. Councillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy. Plans will see Cairn and Gardenrose Primaries merge to become a new school located at the purpose-built campus. Nurseries for both schools would also merge to be ready for August 2021. St Cuthbert’s Primary – where parents responding to the consultation issued a rejection of the move – would also relocate but operate as a stand-alone school. A bid for funding will now be made to the Scottish Government. A total of 87 written responses were received during the council’s consultation that officials noted was “low considering the size of Maybole with a population of 4,700 people”.  Council schools spokesman William Grant said: “There is a general agreement of all schools to come together. “Where we had a more mixed response regarded the possible move of the swimming pool. “It is important as we progress the design that too much is not crammed in to this new campus. “It must be open and spacious.” Maybole Tory councillor Ian Campbell hailed the project as a “wonderful step forward”. And colleague, Hugh Hunter, added: “There are exciting times coming up for Maybole and the town has some real opportunities to flourish.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12935909.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080618maragret_12JPG.jpg","title":"meet this weeks class act","story":"NewsMeet this week\u0027s Class ActAyr United striker Michael Moffat popped along to Queen Margaret Academy to visit the youngsters who were holding a Soccer Aid event.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie15:12, 17 JUL 2018NewsMichael Moffat of Ayr United pictured with the senior sports leaders (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFooty fans and soccer stars joined together for a special charity event last month.

Bids of \u0026pound1.5million are being sought for Enterkine House, perched above Annbank. The luxury four-star retreat, which boasts 74 acres of land, employs around 50 staff. Kirk House and Steading, a six-bedroom farmhouse currently used as overspill accommodation for the hotel, is also included. Agents Christie \u0026amp Co and Galbraith said the plot offered “potential for development under a new owner”. It follows a long-running noise battle at the hotel which saw bosses spend \u0026pound80,000 soundproofing their wedding marquee. Council chiefs were told that slapping an 11pm curfew on party bands could put the hotel out of business.  But they finally got the all-clear earlier this year and revealed plans to build a permanent structure. However, the hotel is now being offered to the market. Bob Cherry, a partner with Galbraith, said: “The purchaser of Enterkine would find it relatively straightforward to continue the current business, which is well-established, and there are further opportunities for diversification or expansion of the tourism and events facilities on the estate, subject to the necessary consents. “This is a beautiful estate with a thriving hotel business and potential for further development.” Brian Sheldon, of Christie \u0026amp Co, added: “The market for country house hotels such as Enterkine House has vastly improved in recent years. “Its location in South Ayrshire and within such an enviable estate and countryside will attract local, regional and potentially international operators. “Whilst the business is trading well, there is certainly scope for further growth.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"royal troon golf club make","story":"NewsRoyal Troon golf club make generous donation to hospital unitIt follows a charity 18-hole golf event with Troon Portland and Troon Ladies, writes Charlene Bennie.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post15:39, 10 JUL 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoyal Troon Golf Club has made the generous donation of \u0026pound1k to Crosshouse Hospital’s Acute Stroke Unit. It follows a charity 18-hole golf event with Troon Portland and Troon Ladies. The game was then followed by a raffle. The three clubs had to choose a charity to donate funds to, with Royal Troon deciding to donate to Ward 3E. Andrew Power, club captain of Royal Troon, said: “We chose to donate to the Acute Stroke Unit as three of our members were in this unit over the last year and are all now recovering well. The word from them is that they got the best of care and were delighted we chose to donate to the unit” During the event, Stroke and TIA (Transient Ischaemic Attack) information packs were handed out, making it a great opportunity to spread awareness of how to act when someone is suffering from a stroke.  Andrew added: “We had a great day, great weather and we were glad we made a good amount for a good cause. We’d like to say from all at Royal Troon that you (staff at Ward 3E) do a great job and hope this cheque can help out in any way it can”. Senior charge nurse, Christine Sommerville, said: “Patients are admitted from all over Ayrshire to the ASU. Stroke happens with no warning, but with specialised care and input, outcomes are improved. “We are delighted to hear the members are recovering well and that they had a positive experience in the ASU. “On behalf of the ASU team, a big thank you.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

Robertson, who had the energetic assistance of a most representative and capable committee of boat-owners and band of other devoted workers, the appeal made to the public for a full measure of that liberal support for which this locality has earned a name which is second to none struck a most responsive chord, with the result that the large hall was crowded to the door.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"kitchen firm cooks up charity cash","story":"Recently Raymond Harvey of the Campbeltown Christmas lights group on left and Lewis MacKay from Castlehill primary football collected cheques from Howden\u0026#8217s manager Archie Martin centre. 25_c28howdens01_RaymondHarvey_ArchieMartin_LewisMackay\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"simple pleasures of working outside in good weather","story":"NFU president Andrew McCornick said: \u0026#8216This year started with a long and expensive winter, caused by a combination of poor weather and a hangover from the previous year’s difficult harvest.\u0026#8216The recent dry spell has been a welcome relief for many of our members.\u0026#8216After suffering a dreadful 12 months of weather they have had an opportunity to cut hay and silage, graze livestock outdoors, and generally enjoy the simple pleasures of working outside in good weather.\u0026#8216The quality of winter fodder made to date is likely to be tremendous.\u0026#8216I am always wary when discussing the downside of warm weather in Scotland, as it is such a rarity.\u0026#8216That being said, many parts will be hoping for a spot of rain.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area.

Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.  The museum is open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10.30am to 4pm each day."},{"url":null,"title":"the-rahs-make-waves-across-the-world","story":"  The band, from Prestonpans, released their latest single Survival through their independent platform EH32 Records last week and have been thrilled by the response it has received.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.

That came after a rigorous audition process, which saw the 15-year-old perform to a group of judges.  Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.  Her first event will feature Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain at the Phil and Aly RSNO St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day Concert at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on November 25.  Music runs in the family, with older brother Ninian, playing the pipes, while Juliet plays the piano and dad Marcus is a member of Haddington\u0026rsquos Siancio Singers.  Clara, who is in S5 at Knox Academy and studying Higher maths, English, geography and human biology, is also a member of the school\u0026rsquos pipe band as well as Haddington Pipe Band, where she is a senior drummer.  Her mum, who praised the efforts of Davey Barnes, who runs Knox Academy Pipe Band, and Dave Henry, drum teacher, said Clara \u0026ldquoloves the drumming and she had made a number of good friends through music and boosted her confidence.  Alastair Bruce, chairman of Haddington Pipe Band, congratulated Clara, who lives in the town, on the achievement.  The youngster won the band\u0026rsquos Niall Fairgrieve Award in 2014 for most improved drummer and has continued to impress.  Mr Bruce said: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoShe has done really well and she is an excellent drummer.  \u0026ldquoShe is onto the development band and that will open up lots of opportunities for her in the future.  The achievement was highlighted by school interim headteacher, Lauren Rodger, in her newsletter.  She added: \u0026ldquoAnyone seeing Clara perform here at Knox will know that she is a natural percussionist and we\u0026rsquore delighted for her."},{"url":null,"title":"kit-fraser-republishes-his-dads-story-of-time-with-macbrayne","story":"  Chris Fraser\u0026rsquos autobiography Christie Boy: A MacBrayne\u0026rsquos Man was released in 1994.  Now his son Kit, who lives in Belhaven, has released a new version of the tale which looks at Chris\u0026rsquo 30-year career with the company, its characters and ships.  The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.  He added that his dad was known as the \u0026lsquostoryteller\u0026rsquo in the family and he wanted to make sure the stories were available to a new generation.  As well as his time with MacBrayne, the book looks at Kit\u0026rsquos dad\u0026rsquos time in the Armed Forces, as well as becoming a sub-postmaster in Aviemore as the town evolved from a \u0026ldquosleepy former railway junction into its present skiing and outdoor pursuits centre.

The 51-year-old, whose nephew is Scotland rugby star Huw Jones, has driven a taxi for nine years to pay his way through university and has built his own film studio and edit suite at his home in Longniddry.  The dad-of-three said: \u0026ldquoThe TV course has been a brilliant journey.  \u0026ldquoColleagues often ask where I find my energy, and sometimes I have to ask myself the same thing, especially at 4am when I have forgotten to go to bed. Perhaps my endurance and resilience comes from my 12 years as a commando.  \u0026ldquoThere have been sacrifices, the biggest of them being to have had no social life throughout this time, but I am passionate about television and I am now talking to production companies and hoping to make my mark in the documentary genre.  While Matt admits it was \u0026ldquoeasy to feel envious of weekend revellers partying, he said driving taxis allowed him to refine his interview skills for his TV career ahead.  And among those to grace the back seat of his cab over the last nine years have been the likes of Angus Deayton, Ian Lavender, Paul Merton, Alexei Sayle, Ruth Madoc and Steven Berkoff.  Matt, who served with the Royal Marines in Northern Ireland, has already completed a music production with National Museums Scotland for a new exhibition on Scottish pop from the 1950s to present day. The classical music enthusiast and trumpeter has also worked on a documentary about Felix Mendelssohn and is currently working on one on Fryderyk Chopin.  Now, following his graduation, he can\u0026rsquot wait to get his documentary career under way in earnest.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhilst studying I have been coached and trained by lecturers who are well-known in the industry and it has been wonderful to benefit from their experience.  \u0026ldquoI am now in the process of sitting down with production companies, and looking forward to establishing my own name as a documentary maker.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park. That would require special funding applications.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.

Taylor Wimpey East Scotland has teamed up with Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ndash both of which are already building on the adjacent Letham Mains site, where more than 800 homes are being built \u0026ndash for the plans on Haddington\u0026rsquos south-western edge.  The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.  Joanne Casey, director of Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel Homes, speaking on behalf of both developers, said the PAN allowed the developers to \u0026ldquobegin the important process of community engagement.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe are fully committed to a detailed programme of engagement with local communities throughout the lifetime of our developments.  \u0026ldquoFor large-scale development projects like this one at Letham Holdings, we are especially keen to fully engage as early as possible in the overall process to allow us to understand and consider the views from as many stakeholders as we can.  \u0026ldquoWe will hold a joint public consultation event during the next few months and we would like to take this opportunity to encourage all interested individuals to become involved.  \u0026ldquoThis event will allow the local community to share their views so that we may consider these as we develop our emerging development proposal in order to make a detailed planning application around October this year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064331.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"east-lothians-chief-nurse-takes-on-health-director-role","story":"  Alison Macdonald has been appointed to replace David Small, who left the post last month to take up a new role as director of primary care transition with NHS Lothian.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Mrs Reid, known as Kit, told how she exchanged early memories of her nursing career and the transition into the NHS with the royal guest.  She said: \u0026ldquoMy first pay was two pound notes and a 10 shilling note. The week before national health it was seven (shillings) and six (pence).  Mrs Reid, of Haddington worked as a nurse from 1946 until 1952 and spent some of her career at Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The grandmother of five, with triplets in Seattle and a grandson in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a further grandson at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoThe Duke was absolutely normal.  \u0026ldquoHe spoke to me and asked various things about the work I had done.  \u0026ldquoObviously he had been briefed because he asked me about the pay and for what felt like a long time he spoke to me.  \u0026ldquoHe was just so charming \u0026ndash it was the thrill of a lifetime, the whole thing.  \u0026ldquoI met so many wonderfully interesting people \u0026ndash people from Orkney and Shetland, from all over Scotland, with their own stories to tell.  \u0026ldquoIt was just absolutely wonderful \u0026ndash I even got to walk on a red carpet.  Mrs Reid said that the NHS had made a massive difference to the way of life across Scotland and said she was \u0026ldquoall for the NHS.  The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.  The evening reception, attended by 700 people, was one of a series of events taking place around the UK to mark 70 years since the health service was founded.

But Mrs Tirb said their relationship was not all plain sailing at first.  \u0026ldquoAt the beginning it was quite challenging, studying alongside each other on the same course, she said.  \u0026ldquoIt definitely tested our relationship, as university can naturally be a very stressful environment.  \u0026ldquoHaving come out the other side though, it definitely shows us that we\u0026rsquore right for each other.  More than a year into their relationship, Mr Tirb popped the question in 2016, while they on their first holiday together in Edinburgh.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos incredible really, it turns out that fate has a sweet face here, having met my future wife on the same course.  \u0026ldquoThree hard years later, we\u0026rsquore still together, still strong and looking forward to a bright future.  The couple intend to maintain their close proximity to each other in their jobs.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore moving to Barnstaple and we\u0026rsquore both going to be working as radiographers at North Devon District Hospital, Mrs Tirb said.  \u0026ldquoWe went on placement together there in our first year and we were really impressed.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a really exciting time because we\u0026rsquore going to be starting the next chapter of our lives together, as well as our careers.  Mr Tirb added: \u0026ldquoTuesday carries with it the memories of the special times spent at university.  \u0026ldquoIt commemorates an end of one chapter of our lives and the beginning of two others \u0026ndash our careers and a new life together as a married couple.  The pair will hold a wedding ceremony in Romania on September 1, surrounded by family and friends."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-caves-in-to-brexiteers-demands-to-avoid-humiliating-commons-defeat","story":"  Last night, the Eurosceptic Conservative MPs\u0027 new clause 36, to prevent the UK collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU unless it agreed to collect them for the UK, which the Government decided to back, much to the annoyance of Remainer Tories, was approved by the skin of it teeth: 305 votes to 302, a majority three.  Such was the anger of some pro-EU Conservatives at Mrs May\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquocave-in to the Brexiteers that one, Guto Bebb, the Defence Minister, resigned so that he could oppose the Government. He becomes the 10th person\u0026nbspto resign over Brexit.  In other votes, Labour\u0027s new clause 11, which aimed to establish securing a customs union with the EU as a negotiating objective, was defeated by 316 votes to 289, a majority of 27, and the SNP\u0027s new clause 16, requiring the Scottish Parliament\u0027s consent to implement several powers in the Bill, was defeated by 316 votes to 36, a majority of 280.  Eurosceptic Conservatives had earlier proposed four changes to the UK Government\u0027s Customs Bill aimed at imposing strict conditions on Mrs May after she produced a plan at Chequers that would keep the UK closely tied to Brussels\u0027 rules on goods and food.  Just hours before MPs were due to vote on the amendments to the Taxation[Cross Border Trade] Bill, proposed by the European Research Group[ERG] led by ardent Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, No 10 announced it would not be opposing them, claiming they were \u0026ldquoconsistent with the PM\u0026rsquos Brexit blueprint.  Three of the changes - to maintain the Union and not allow a customs border down the Irish Sea, to take the UK out of the EU\u0026rsquos VAT regime and to guarantee there would be no new customs union with the EU without primary legislation at Westminster \u0026ndash seemed to roughly align with the Chequers compromise.  But the fourth - a refusal to collect tariffs on behalf of another country without reciprocity across the continent so that the EU would collect duties on behalf of the UK \u0026ndash did not not least because the EU27 would not agree to giving Britain preferential treatment.  However, No 10 pointed out a section of the White Paper to justify its argument of consistency.  It reads: \u0026ldquoThe UK proposes a tariff revenue formula, taking account of goods destined for the UK entering via the EU and goods destined for the EU entering via the UK.  This, a Downing Street spokesman, made clear the idea of reciprocity was hard-wired into the Chequers Plan.  Yet the paragraph goes on to say: \u0026ldquoHowever, the UK is not proposing that the EU applies the UK\u0026rsquos tariffs and trade policy at its border for goods intended for the UK.  During Commons exchanges, Mrs May - in response to Labour MP Stephen Kinnock\u0026rsquos claim that she had \u0026ldquocapitulated to the Tory hard Right - was adamant the Brexiteer amendments did not change her Brexit blueprint.  \"He is absolutely wrong\u0026hellipI would not have gone through all the work that I did to ensure we reached that agreement only to see it changed in some way through these Bills. They do not change that Chequers agreement, she declared.  But not everyone was convinced. Her Tory colleague Anna Soubry, a leading Remainer, told MPs it seemed Mr Rees-Mogg was now \u0026ldquorunning Britain.  In contrast, Priti Patel, the former International Development Secretary and a prominent Leaver, who tabled the amendment calling for reciprocal action on collecting tariffs, said the PM\u0026rsquos move was \"constructive\".  Her Brexiteer colleague Peter Bone denounced the Chequers Plan as an \u0026ldquoabsolute shambles and called on his party leader to take it off the table.  Kirsty Blackman for the SNP accused the PM of being \u0026ldquoheld hostage by the Tory Brexiteers and suggested the Conservative Government was riding roughshod over Holyrood\u0026rsquos voice on EU withdrawal.  The Aberdeen MP said while businesses were desperate for clarity over endless Tory confusion, \u0026ldquowe get only in-fighting and a prime minister, who caves in to her extreme hard Brexit wing.  Outside the chamber, one Brexiteer source boasted how Mrs May\u0027s move on the Customs Bill had confirmed \"Chequers is dead on arrival\".  Earlier, the PM faced a call from leading Remainer Justine Greening, the former Education Secretary, to facilitate a second EU referendum given the parliamentary \u0026ldquodeadlock but No 10 made clear the Government would not agree to such a move \u0026ldquounder any circumstances.  The powerplay over the Customs Bill is just one of several potential flashpoints this week.  After the votes on the Customs Bill, MPs will on Tuesday debate the Trade Bill and the issue of whether Britain should remain in the European single market.  On Wednesday, following the last PMQs of the parliamentary session, MPs will debate Britain\u0027s future relationship with the EU and Mrs May will later appear before the Commons Liaison Committee made up of Committee Chairmen.  It is thought David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, and Boris Johnson, the former Foreign Secretary, will sometime this week make personal resignation statements in the Commons, which will pile more pressure on the PM.  The danger to Mrs May has been underlined by the disclosure that Brexiteers have set up a WhatsApp group to co-ordinate voting tactics, organised by Steve Baker, who last week quit his job as Brexit Minister over the Chequers plan.  It has been suggested more than 100 MPs have joined the group, a number which is more than double the 48 needed to submit letters of no confidence in Mrs May to trigger a leadership contest.  Meanwhile earlier in the day,\u0026nbspScott Mann, the Cornwall MP, became the ninth person to quit their post in protest at the Chequers Plan. The ex-ministerial aide to the Treasury and a former postman, said he would not \"deliver a watered-down Brexit\"."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-caledonian-university-chaplain-holds-mass-for-gross-offence-of-pride","story":"  Father Mark Morris, of Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church, last night invited parishioners to a rosary of reparation.  According the Balornock church\u0027s website, the service was a \"Rosary of reparation for the gross offence to God which is Pride Glasgow.\"  Saturday\u0027s Pride march was led by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who called the event \u0026ldquocelebrating and reaffirming the values of tolerance, diversity, equality, love and respect.  But last night Father Morris, who is the Catholic chaplain of Glasgow Caledonian University, held a service offering decades of the Rosary, Litany and Benediction in reparation for the LGBTI event.  Jordan Daly, Co-Founder of Time for Inclusive Education (TIE), which campaigns for inclusive education in schools, said it was \"sad and disappointing\" to see Father Morris\u0027s \"condemnation\" of the event.  He said: \"The Pride parade was, as always, a vibrant and colourful display of diversity, acceptance, and inclusivity.  \"The ethos of the parade is equality and love, so it is sad and disappointing to see that Father Morris has countered those fundamental values by holding this service and allowing a narrative of exclusion and condemnation to enter the mainstream as a result.\"  Father Morris celebrates Mass on Thursdays in the Faith and Belief Centre in the university\u0027s William Harley Building, and hears confession.  A spokesman for the Catholic Church in Glasgow said: \u0026ldquoThis was a private parish devotion unrelated\u0026nbspto Father\u0026nbspMorris\u0026rsquos role as chaplain.  Jordan added: \"We are concerned about the message that this could send to the young people of Glasgow Caledonian University, and so would like to stress that these predictable voices of opposition are becoming increasingly drowned out by a Catholic and wider faith community which is supportive of LGBT equality.  \"There were many people of faith who attended the Parade this weekend and in our efforts to advance LGBT-inclusive education in schools, we have been strongly supported by numerous Catholic Priests and their parishioners, as well as Church of Scotland and Scottish Episcopal Church ministers.  \"Our experience working with the Scottish Catholic Education Service as part of the Scottish Government\u0027s LGBT Inclusive Education Working Group has also been nothing but positive and productive.  \"We know that those who support the LGBT community outweigh those who endorse intolerance and I imagine that the number of attendees to this service in contrast with those who attended the Pride parade would further prove that.\"  Glasgow Caledonian University and the Catholic Church in Glasgow have been contacted for comment."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8083985.jpg?type=article-full","title":"ghosts-have-a-dispiriting-effect-on-home-values-finds-study","story":"  At least that is the claim of a new study which reveals that supposedly haunted houses are having thousands of pounds wiped off their value the moment they are investigated for paranormal activity.  Statistician Dr Geoff Ellis said his study into 25 British \"haunted houses\", sold over the last half-century, revealed they lost an average of 17 per cent off their value compared with the sale prices of similar homes nearby.  What was said to be Scotland\u0027s most haunted house lay empty for decades before it was finally sold.  The eerie 18th century home, called Windhouse, nestled in the centre of a tiny island nature reserve, had only one permanent resident since the 1920s - a ghostly apparition known as the \"lady in silk\".    Legend had it the haunting was the result of one event, in the 19th century. The house\u0027s then-owner, a man called Harrison, decided that sheep would be more profitable than people and evicted his tenants in a mini Highland clearance.  One old lady, forced from her home, is said to have cursed Windhouse and everyone who would ever live in it.  Ghostly inhabitants have since included a lady dressed in silk who is believed to be the spirit of a woman whose skeleton was found under floorboards of the main stairs.  So called because of the rustling sound of her dress and petticoats, the ghoul was said to walk three times in a circle at the top of a flight of stairs, give a sigh, and then disappear.    The Grade-C listed home on Yell, Shetland which was first built in 1707 and then rebuilt in 1880, was eventually bought in 2003 by the couple from Cheshire who fell in love with the place and planned to renovate the castellated house. But it fell through.  Twelve years later the building which is on Historic Environment Scotland\u0027s buildings at risk register was put back on the market, with offers above \u0026pound25,000 and prospective purchasers were advised not to enter the site because of the building\u0027s extremely dangerous condition.  Dr Ellis\u0027s research suggests having a haunted house would knock almost \u0026pound40,000 off the average UK property price when it came to selling it.  A separate survey of 2,000 Britons found nearly one in four believed their houses were haunted, while 55% said they would be put off buying a haunted house.  The study, believed to be the first in the world looking at paranormal property, was commissioned by TV channel Really to mark the new series of Help! My House Is Haunted.    Barri Ghai, Sandy Lakdar and Chris Fleming from Help! My House is Haunted on Really  Adam Collings, Really channel director said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos staggering how much money could be wiped-off the value of your property, should you feel your house is haunted and eye-opening to see just how many of us have experienced spooky goings-on at home.  \"The research suggests it\u0026rsquos probably a good idea to keep your eyes peeled for paranormal activity when viewing a property, as your new house could become a very bad investment when you come to sell it, should it be found to be haunted.  The gloomy findings also found that well over half of the Scottish respondents (61%) say they\u0026rsquod be put off buying a haunted house, whilst 27% of property buyers have felt a spooky presence when viewing a house, which has put them off buying.  It certainly did not appear to put off Prince Charles who bought Dumfries House, a then dilapidated 18th century Scottish mansion that he saved for the nation at the 11th hour, 11 years ago.  It was put on the market and its contents were already on their way to an auction house ready to be sold off. But a group convened by the prince secured the property and its furniture for \u0026pound45m, with \u0026pound20m personally guaranteed by Charles himself.    The Duchess of Cornwall recently admitted that a visit to the rundown mansion soon after its purchase left her spooked and that she was unable to enter for several years after being convinced it was haunted.  \"It had a really eerie feel about it,\" she said. \"There was definitely a ghost. Without a shadow of a doubt. I remember the first time I walked up the steps, got into the hall and I thought I can\u0027t go any further. I literally froze. If my hair could stand on end, it would have done.  \"I remember leaving and thinking I don\u0027t want to come back here again and I didn\u0027t for a few years.\"  Camilla would later become more accustomed to the house\u0027s idiosyncrasies .  Given the survey results, it was perhaps unsurprising to find that eight in ten Scots (80%) polled said they would lie to their estate agent to cover up the fact their house was haunted to avoid the financial consequences."},{"url":null,"title":"major-search-at-reservoir-after-reports-a-teenager-was-in-the-water","story":"  Emergency vehicles were sent to Glenburn Reservoir near Paisley after the alarm was raised at about 17:35.

A wide-ranging study of the nation\u0027s telly time has revealed that the over-55s have claimed the crown as the chieftain of the couch potato race, spending almost four times as much watching broadcasts compared to their offspring.  Last year, those heading for retirement age spent and nearly six hours a day transfixed by their living room screen, compared to just an hour and a half for those aged between 4 and 15.  And while the number of minutes whiled away by the older generation watching soaps, dramas and documentaries has fallen in recent years, it is still almost two hours greater than the national average of nearly four hours a day uncovered by Ofcom\u0027s first Media Nations Scotland report.  Overall, Scots watch more TV than people living in other parts of the UK, the report said, with viewers north of the border spending a daily average of three hours and 46 minutes in front of their sets - 24 minutes more than the UK average of three hours and 23 minutes.    And they are watching a wide range of programmes. The report delved into the most popular shows last year and found that terrestrial TV is still pulling in audiences in the millions.  It helps to go big \u0027event\u0027 TV, such as the final of Strictly Come Dancing the Mrs Brown\u0027s Boys Christmas special, pulled in the most viewers as did reality shows I\u0027m a Celebrity - Get Me Out of Here! and Britain\u0027s Got Talent.  But there was also a place for \u0027quality\u0027 television, with the ten-years-in-the-making series Blue Planet II and big-budget dramas Broadchurch and The Moorside also proving to be hits with the audience.  The Strictly final was the most-viewed broadcast programme on television across Scotland in 2017, with more than 1.1 million viewers tuning in to watch Scottish actor and Former Holby City star Joe McFadden and his partner Katya Jones lift the glitterball trophy.  Other hits for the year included the BBC\u0027s long-running Hogmanay show and its football-related stablemate Only and Excuse, Emmerdale, Coronation Street and Sherlock.  The BBC and ITV dominated terrestrial viewing habits, sharing all slots in a top-20 league table of the\u0026nbsp nation\u0027s most-watched programmes between them.  Yet while both channels remain strong, Ofcom found that people are slowly turning their backs on traditional TV.  On average, Scots are tuning in for 46 fewer minutes each day than they did eight years ago, and the decline is even steeper among children.  Youngsters have cut the amount of TV they consume each day by an hour - and the trend is accelerating.  But while people in Scotland are watching less broadcast television, they are spending more time watching other things such as online streaming on their TV set.    Daily viewing of non-broadcast content, such as YouTube and subscription on-demand services including Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, increased to 40 minutes.  BBC iPlayer was the most popular on-demand/streaming service among adults in Scotland in January 2018, with almost half saying they used it, followed by Netflix and the STV Player.  The report found the use of Netflix is \"heavily skewed towards younger viewers\".  While a third of adults in Scotland claim to use the service at least once a week, the number doubles among 16-24-year-olds while half of\u0026nbsp 25-34s say they use it.  But the service, which relies on an understanding of new technology, has not been taken up by baby boomers - with fewer than one in ten saying they tuned in.  The report said that the BBC, STV and ITV spent a combined \u0026pound53.9m on first-run, UK-made programmes for viewers in Scotland, an 8 per cet real-terms decrease year-on-year.  It said this decline was the result of lower spending by the BBC, down by 10 per cent year on year, while STV/ITV spending remained broadly stable.  The report also examined trends in the radio and audio sectors and found the amount of time people spent listening to digital radio has continued to grow, with two thirds of Scots now owning one.\u0026nbsp Almost nine in ten (88%) of adults listen to the radio every week.  On average, adults in Scotland spend 14 hours four minutes each week listening to any type of audio, the majority of it live radio.  Glenn Preston, Ofcom\u0027s Scotland Director, said: \"Today\u0027s research shows that the way people in Scotland watch TV is changing rapidly.  \"Although viewers in Scotland watch more TV than in the rest of the UK, they are spending less time watching \u0027traditional\u0027 broadcast TV and are turning to online streaming services, attracted by their exclusive programmes and vast libraries of classic shows.  \"Broadcasters in Scotland must confront the challenges posed by both online streaming companies and the changing way people are watching television, to ensure they continue to make great shows to appeal to Scottish viewers in the digital age.\""},{"url":null,"title":"so-scots-and-londoners-are-different-think-again","story":"  That is because a major new analysis of Britain\u0026rsquos most robust social attitudes survey shows that the UK capital shares more values with Scotland than with its own hinterland.  The National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) found Scots and Londoners were the most left-wing and liberal Britons with more in common with each other than with Wales and provincial England.  The new work overturns long-standing assumptions on both sides of the Border that Scotland has more cultural and political affinity with the north of England than the south.  Some 60 per cent of Scots identify as left-wing, compared with 58% of Londoners and just 51% of Northerners. But Londoners and Scots were also the most likely to back tax-and-spend policies and sympathise with people on welfare.  Neil Smith, research director at Natcen, said: \u0026ldquoWhile there are clear distinctions in the way Londoners think about certain social and political issues, in quite a few instances \u0026ndash despite the geographical distance and the different make-ups of our populations \u0026ndash Londoners share more in common with the Scots than with their regional neighbours. Both are more likely to be engaged in politics, have the greatest proportion of left-affiliated individuals, are more likely to fall on the pro-welfare end of the scale, and are most inclined to sympathise with benefit claimants.  The survey comes two years after Scotland and London emerged as the only two \u0026ldquoregions of the island of Britain to oppose Brexit.  London has become a stronghold for Labour in southern England. Its mayor, Sadiq Khan, shares the distinction with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of being \u0026ndash reports suggest \u0026ndash- despised by America\u0026rsquos populist right president.  Similar social attitudes may also reflect the rarely acknowledged reality that Scotland, collectively, has higher living standards and economic activity than anywhere in the UK bar London and the south-east.  The analysis is based on the British Social Attitudes Survey carried out by NatCen, and considered one of the best snap shots of what people think.  It was commissioned by Trust for London, a charity and think- tank. The Trust\u0026rsquos chief executive, Bharat Mehta, stressed what he saw as common values across the UK.  He said: \u0026ldquoPart of the story is the striking similarities between the attitudes of Londoners and those of Scots. The other part, is how on important issues like equality, education and public spending, Londoners hold comparable views to everyone else."},{"url":null,"title":"queen-guitarist-brian-may-to-celebrate-work-of-victorian-royal-photographer","story":"  George Washington Wilson, from Aberdeen, spearheaded a form of 3D imagery which captured the imagination of the musician a century later.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Wednesday 18 Jul 2018 8:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116574.jpg","title":"High calibre medical staff recruited in Caithness","story":"\u0026nbspNHS Highland yesterday confirmed the full and part-time appointments, which include two advanced nurse practitioners and a physiotherapist.Bill Fernie, chairman of Caithness Health Action Team, said: \u0026ldquoIt is definitely good news that the posts which were empty for a long time are being filled and that is welcomed by us.\u0026ldquoThis is a success for NHS Highland but it has been a long time coming.

The recruitment of three GPs is particularly remarkable considering a quarter of GP practices across Scotland have vacancies.\u0026ldquoThe recruitment of all the clinicians will improve the continuity of care provided by the practices while introducing access to a specialist primary care physio at the three sites.\u0026ldquoReducing the reliance on temporary locums will enable NHS Highland to save money while improving care.

Not only will this bring benefit to local bus users, who would otherwise be isolated in their communities, but it also has potential to benefit the tourist market, providing services to link with the Gills Bay ferry.However, she is concerned about the review in 12 months time and said: \u0026ldquoWe will be working with Stagecoach and the local community to see what can be done to promote usage of the route, and will also be discussing with public sector partners such as Highland Council to see what might be done to secure the route on a non-commercial basis in future.Bill Mowat, the chairman of Gills Harbour Ltd, claimed public pressure had an impact on Stagecoach and pointed out there was strong opposition to the plan.Wednesday 18 Jul 2018 8:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July 17, 2018 at 4:31 pmAs children across Scotland enjoy their summer holidays, NHS 24 is offering help to parents, grandparents and carers to keep the family safe and healthy, whether at home or abroad.

Last November, Loganair flew Teddy over 200 miles back to Kirkwall for a tearful homecoming with his young owner.Officially launched to mark Teddy Bear Picnic Day, this Tuesday, July 10, the furry keepsakes come with their very own Loganbear luggage tags as well as outfits mirroring the tartan look and feel of the airline’s own uniforms. Throughout the summer months, children will be able to pick between a Logie or Lotti bear once they come onboard a Loganair aircraft, distributed by the airline’s flight crew.The airline is running a number of social media competitions and promotional activity featuring the bears throughout July and August and will also be launching its Instagram channel to showcase the two toys.Kay Ryan, Commercial Director at Loganair said: “We’re very much looking forward to giving some of our youngest passengers a special memory of their trip with Loganair and what better day to unveil the two newest members of our crew than Teddy Bear Picnic day.“Logie and Lotti will be flying with us all summer and our crew can’t wait to introduce them onboard.“Last year the airline did everything it could to reunite a young girl with her lost teddy so this summer we thought we’d try and share some of that joy with children travelling with us.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This includes security and airfield operations, airside services, firefighters, operations officers and passenger service agents.“Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members,\u0026#8221 said Unite regional officer Wullie Wallace.\u0026#8220The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard-working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.“Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities.

This could run into millions of pounds and put at risk the future viability of the business.The company have also met with local Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur, to express their concerns about the delay.As the start of this month, as Mr Matheson stepped into the shoes of the previous minister for transport Humza Yousaf, it was announced that lack of agreement between the Scottish Government and Pentland Ferries had led to no discounted fares being introduced in Pentland Firth ferry routes, by the Government\u0026#8217s self-set deadline of the end of last month.Andrew Banks, Managing Director and Owner of Pentland Ferries said: “We want these passenger subsidies implemented as soon as possible but we need to be 100 per cent sure that the scheme complies with state aid rules.  We have never had any subsidy from the government and even though this scheme gives money to the passenger, not the operator, the minister has told us that we would be liable for any repayment if at a future date the scheme is deemed illegal. This could run into the millions and could finish us off.“We cannot take that risk and we have a responsibility to our staff, our community and family to make sure the scheme works for everyone. We want to work with the Minister and his team to discuss a way forward so that we can all benefit from reduced fares. This scheme will be fantastic for our business, attracting more visitors to the islands and making it cheaper to travel to the mainland for residents. So we want this unlocked as soon as possible. We welcome the Minister’s willingness to gain a full understanding of the detail and very much hope to be able to meet him in Orkney soon.”The minister, Mr Matheson, was asked for a response to the comments from Pentland Ferries and Mr Banks. At the time he replied, Transport Scotland said the invitation had not yet been received so the minister could not comment.However, Mr Matheson did say: “The Scottish Government remains committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles. I am conscious that there is a great deal of interest in this issue amongst users of the services. As I begin my new role as Transport Secretary, I want to ensure that I gain a full understanding of the detail — it is already very clear to me that planning to introduce reduced fares on the Northern Isles network has been a complex and challenging piece of work.“As a first step, we will cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services from June 30. These reductions will be around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.“On routes to Orkney, it has been necessary to engage with commercial operators on the Pentland Firth. We set out a very fair and reasonable proposal that would maintain competition, enabling them to protect their existing market share. Unfortunately, not all the commercial operators have felt able to agree to our proposals. This means we cannot currently implement reduced fares on any of the routes to and from Orkney without the risk of legal challenge.“This is both disappointing and frustrating, but I am determined to work through the issue to see what more can be done. I have asked Transport Scotland to undertake some further work to see what measures, if any, we can take. As part of that, we are willing to reopen talks with commercial operators.  I will provide a further update to stakeholders and to Parliament as soon as I can, with a view to bringing the full benefits of the scheme to the people of Orkney and Shetland.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will help reduce the initial barrier of connection for a defined period of time.Two events are planned at the St Magnus Centre in Kirkwall, from 6pm to 8pm on Wednesday July 11 then from 10am to 12pm on Thursday July 12 with a further event at the Doubletree by Hilton, Glasgow Central, from 10.30am to 12.30noon on Friday July 13 and finally, a webinar will take place on Tuesday July 17 from 10am to 12pm.Registration is required for the Alternative Approach consultations via the following link: https://www.ssen-transmission/news-views/articles/2018/6/solving-orkney-s-catch-22/Commenting on the Alternative Approach consultation events, Lauren Milligan, commercial policy manager, said: “As a customer-driven initiative, stakeholder engagement has shaped the Alternative Approach proposal to date.“We want to ensure that we develop a solution that not only works for network companies but also the wider industry and other connection customers and would therefore encourage anyone with an interest in our proposed Alternative Approach trial to register for one of our consultation events.”The final stage of consultation is planned to take place in Autumn on the various components of the transmission reinforcement project in advance of submitting planning applications to the relevant planning authorities, the Scottish Government, Marine Scotland and Orkney Islands Council.The progression of the project is subject to all necessary planning consents and securing regulatory approval from industry regulator Ofgem, with the Alternative Approach trial also subject to regulatory approval.For more information on the proposed Orkney transmission reinforcement, including links to both consultation documents, click here.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We created the FitHomes concept to help Highland residents take charge of their own wellbeing and health needs through innovative technology and design.\"Thanks to the support we\u0026rsquove had from Centrica, both financially and advisory, we will be able to deliver digital health and assisted living technologies in a way that has not been possible before.\"The investment has been made by Centrica\u0026rsquos Ignite social impact investment fund. Established in 2017, Centrica Innovations aims to invest \u0026pound100 million by 2022 in new technologies that will transform the way people live, work and move.Sam Salisbury, Centrica Innovations labs director, said: \"As a market leader in connected home products, we are always on the lookout for opportunities to solve real world problems with new technology and innovation. The lack of affordable, energy efficient, desirable homes is one that is affecting families across the country so we\u0026rsquore delighted to be able to support an initiative that shows such potential in transforming how people, young and old, live in their homes.\"The origins of the FitHome go back to 2008 when a tenant was found dead in his home, having lain unnoticed for over a year. Vowing to put new preventative systems in place, Albyn commissioned research exploring potential solutions.

It\u0026rsquos not an easy decision.\"We\u0026rsquove listened to customers, colleagues, communities and elected representatives and we continue to do so.\"We\u0026rsquove committed to making no further changes to the size of our branch network in Scotland until at least 2020 \u0026ndash and not to remove or replace, at a suitable nearby location, the branch ATM if there\u0026rsquos no other free-to-use ATM within 1km of the closing branch.\"The way our customers are banking is changing and it is important that we respond to that change. Across Scotland, usage of our branches is down 42 per cent since 2014. Only one per cent of our customers in Scotland visit their branch on a regular weekly basis. Seven in 10 customers are using mobile or online banking.\"\"We recognise that every customer will have different banking needs and we are committed to ensuring all our customers receive the best possible service.\"We\u0026rsquove invested to provide more ways to bank with us now than ever before.\"He added: \"We\u0026rsquove committed to keeping 10 branches open until the end of 2018.\"Johnston Carmichael has been appointed to carry out an independent review into these 10 branches and are meeting with local customers, representatives, employees and stakeholders in all ten communities to understand the impact of each individual closure.\"We have committed to accepting the recommendations of this review in full.\"Wednesday 18 Jul 2018 8:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Depute fiscal Alison McKenzie told Sheriff Margaret Neilson the 15-year-old was being trained in lifeguard skills and it was when they were alone at the pool Russell repeatedly fondled him over his trunks: \"It happened so frequently he could not recall the number of occasions he was molested,\" said the fiscal.The boy didn\u0026rsquot report the assaults and told no-one until many years later as a father of two he received a letter from Russell offering to act as a football scout for his children.The fiscal said: \"The complainer was furious, recalled the abuse he suffered at the hands of the accused, and made a statement of complaint to police.\"Russell admitted assaulting the boy on various dates between 1977 and 1979 at Dingwall Sports Centre Swimming Pool and between May and June 1981 at the Mackay Hostel sexually assaulting a 16-year-old.He further admitted assaulting an 18-year-old by handling his buttocks over his kilt in 1983 at a street in Dingwall and exposing himself to him.He also pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting an 18- year-old at the hostel in 1984 by sitting on his bed uninvited, placing his hand under the bed covers and repeatedly attempting to touch his genitals.Sentence was deferred after his last appearance for reports.Russell is due to appear in court again on August 2.Wednesday 18 Jul 2018 8:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

In more recent times, it has seen the fairytale rise of Ross County from Highland League to Premiership \u0026ndash and a notorious Town Hall appearance by the Beatles when the Fab Four were on the brink of global success.Now, history hunters are being targeted by DCDC which has sought to work with the public to create a new vision of the town.Fascinating facts are being assembled by Dingwall History Society for panels dotting the town and shining light on its rich past.Secretary\u0026nbspSandra MacDonald said: \"Dingwall has a very long and significant history and we have the information available.\"The group will gather facts and suggest significant sites worthy of interpretation but will not have the final say.Mrs MacDonald, whose late husband David \"DD\" MacDonald chaired the society for a decade, said: \"There are the obvious sites like the Tollbooth \u0026ndash the tower and the clock.\"Other sites being considered include the war memorials at Station Square and the Hector Macdonald Monument and Moot Hill in the Cromartie Memorial car park, where the Vikings are believed to have held gatherings.Mrs MacDonald added: \"A board can carry a minimum amount of information but can indicate where people can access far more online.\"DCDC secretary Robin Lingard revealed the heritage trail is one of several items being proposed by the group, set up as a charity two years ago to tap funding pots for improvements. He told a recent open meeting that membership had more than doubled. \"We are very pleased,\" he said. \"I think out of it new ideas will come forward.\"Community activist George Murray, project manager for Dingwall Means Business, targeting the establishment of a business improvement district (BID), said: \"I think the DCDC is the perfect body to spearhead and develop plans like the heritage trail. I see it as being beneficial not only for local community development and participation but also as a way of presenting our community heritage to the world, especially as we get busier with the advent of the cruise tour coaches beginning to discover the town and the success of the NC500 route.\"If suitable funding can be put in place a heritage trail round the area could be a real boon to the town.\"Dingwall councillor Angela MacLean said a trail is \"a fantastic opportunity\" to showcase the town.She said: \"Many of the DCDC group\u0026rsquos wish list buildings are in the ownership of the Highland Council and if DCDC or another local group would like to take over and run of any of these buildings I am more than happy to lend my support. I would also like to congratulate DCDC for the work they have done so far and look forward to working with them to make some of their proposals a reality over the coming years.\"\u0026bull What do you think about the idea?

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4770159.1531858020!/image/image.jpg","title":"manish jethwa glasgow can be the uk s landmark low emission city","story":"        The Scottish Government has unveiled plans to work with councils to introduce low-emission zones (LEZs) in Scotland\u0026#8217s four biggest cities by 2020. The objective is clear: to reduce emissions and improve air quality across Scotland.                Glasgow plans to have Scotland’s first LEZ in place by the end of this year and it will eventually result in all but the cleanest-engine vehicles being banned from the city centre. That is one key way in which the city could work towards its key goal of lowering emissions, but what else can the authorities do to achieve not just this core aim but also the wider goal of reducing air pollution?            New technology that connects a range of different infrastructure together potentially has a big role to play. The latest advances in ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT) technology allow cities to connect to street lights, buildings, bridges, drainage systems and other infrastructure to monitor and analyse how they interact. This can form the foundation for local authorities’ development of smart cities or regions with reducing emissions an important part of this.            READ MORE: Fears raised that Scotland’s firs low-emission zone will have little impactLocal authorities across Scotland already have networks of automatic monitoring stations in place to capture relevant data from various points and assess air quality. Sensors can be installed on street lights above the reach of vandals but at a level low enough to measure the air people are breathing.The data collected allows councils to monitor pollution levels and then adjust their strategy around road building, transport planning and pedestrianisation, for example, both to keep emissions to a minimum and reduce the impact they have on the wider public. Power and communication can be delivered through the street infrastructure and the wider smart city network. Linked to this, cities could also look to further cut emissions by reducing the number of traffic hotspots in the areas under their control. That’s essentially about pinpointing where traffic is heaviest. The UK is currently a very congested nation. Back in 2016, analytics company Inrix monitored traffic on every road in 123 cities, including London, Glasgow, Rome and Madrid. Its analysis revealed more than 20,300 so-called “traffic hotspots” in UK cities – well over double the number in Germany and twice that of France.READ MORE: Glasgow’s Internet of Things network expandsKnowing where the main points of congestion are is half the battle. Armed with that knowledge, councils can start to mitigate the problem by introducing new approaches to traffic signalling, for example, or by enhancing communication with other road users through better signposting. Dynamic traffic forecasting is another fast-emerging technology that these Scottish cities could potentially make use of. The approach connects infrastructure assets and devices to improve mobility across cities, thereby helping to reduce the time vehicles are on the road and, by extension, minimise emissions. Sensors at parking spots could collect real-time data on parking availability and be transmitted across networks, linking with end-user and local authority devices. Traffic control cameras could be connected to the transport authority in real time, enabling them to potentially increase the frequency and duration of green lights depending on road conditions.            It’s yet another example of how the smartest Scottish cities can successfully implement low-emission zones and keep pollution levels to a minimum over the coming years by adopting the latest technology solutions to monitor and measure the current situation – and then take action.Manish Jethwa is chief technology officer at Yotta"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4769785.1531895740!/image/image.jpg","title":"wood group brings in new chief technology officer","story":"        Energy and engineering services giant Wood Group has appointed Darren Martin to the new role of chief technology officer as the firm looks to ramp up its digital offering.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16?

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

Any avoidable delay in receiving essential treatment is unacceptable.\n\u0026#8220Many of these passengers have been waiting for their appointments for months if not years, and have no way to access the treatment and specialists they need at home.\n\u0026#8220Travelling out with the isles for medical treatment is already stressful for vulnerable isles residents without the added anxiety caused by cancellations. Rescheduling appointments is not easy for those living in remote communities and patients may have a lengthy wait for another opportunity to travel.\n\u0026#8220The right to strike is an important one and I understand that strikes have to cause disruption in order to be effective.\n\u0026#8220But, I urge your members to carefully consider this compromise: Loganair flights from the North Isles use smaller aircraft which require a lower level of fire service cover.\n\u0026#8220Therefore, Unite members could guarantee a minimum level of fire and security coverage on the proposed strike dates, allowing life-line Orkney and Shetland flights to continue for essential medical travel.\n\u0026#8220I hope further discussions will resolve the dispute before any strike action goes ahead and that the needs of North Isles passengers are at the forefront of your decision making.\u0026#8221\nMeanwhile, Loganair is giving passengers in Shetland the chance to change their flights.\nAbout 170 members, including key airport staff, security workers and firefighters have voted in favour of striking – with more talks expected next week involving conciliation service Acas.\nTwenty-four-hour strikes are planned for Friday 20th July as well as on Thursday 2nd August and Thursday16th August.\nLoganair managing director Jonathan Hinkles said passengers could change their flights free of charge.\nHe said: “Although there is still time for the strike to be averted and we hope it will be, we are offering customers booked to fly to or from Aberdeen on the strike dates the opportunity to change their travel date or route if they wish.\n\u0026#8220This is free of charge and designed to offer certainty of alternatives for those booked to travel.\n\u0026#8220We also have contingency plans to operate Aberdeen flights to alternate airports on strike days if this does go ahead, and will announce details of those if this action cannot be averted. Our website is up to date with the latest information.”\nUnite regional officer Wullie Wallace expected talks with Acas next week. The dispute is over pay for airport workers. A total of 88 per cent of workers rejected the latest pay offer.\nThe union said members had rejected two below-inflation wage offers on the back of below inflation increases over the last two years.\nMr Wallace said: \u0026#8220Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members. The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.\n\u0026#8220Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities. It’s high time for the company to invest in its employees. Unite remains open to further discussions with a view to resolving the dispute.\u0026#8221\nAn unattributed quote from an Aberdeen spokesman stated: \u0026#8220We have been informed by Unite of their intention to take industrial action on Friday 20th July.\n\u0026#8220This follows the rejection of our proposed pay offer. We believe we have made an offer that is entirely fair and reasonable and we are committed to continuing discussions to reach a resolution acceptable to all parties.\n\u0026#8220We have made contact with Acas which has agreed to mediate between both parties. We are seeking a suitable date to continue our discussions in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable position.\n\u0026#8220We will, as a matter of course, ensure contingency plans are in place in the event of any planned industrial action.”\nI am amazed that the Scottish Government will allow a union to hold hostage urgent healthcare for 45,000 citizens in Shetland and Orkney. It is reasonable to suspect that the SNP is in the unions’ pockets.\nI can only suggest that if Christopher wants to find out who is in the ‘unions pockets’ he should investigate the connection between the Labour Party and Unite,  and while he’s at it perhaps he should refresh his memory as to what powers are reserved at Westminster and which are devolved to Holyrood.\nThere are so many reds under beds these days \u0026#8230\n My primary concern is that Shetland and Orkney folk will be at risk for a number of August days while this irresponsible union strikes.

in the eye of storm in Tornado Alley","story":"Nicole Webber\n\u0026nbsp\nA storm chaser from Newtonmore had to run for cover from some of the world\u0027s most extreme weather in Tornado Alley.\nScott Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nWednesday 18 Jul 2018 8:39

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

Sabhal Mòr Ostaig principal Prof Boyd Robertson said, \u0026#8220This is a richly-deserved honour for Duncan which recognises the hugely important contribution he has made to the development of the college over many years and the vital contribution he has made to the development of the Gaelic language and culture and to the advancement of Gaelic and Gaelic-medium education, both as a teacher and as a former HM Inspector.”\n“Duncan\u0026#8217s critical input to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig’s development in its challenging formative years was marked by his steady stewardship, as a former chairman and his pioneering work, alongside that of his fellow trustees, demonstrated an exemplary vision and commitment without which what is now the National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture would not have existed.”\n“For that, all who have benefited from this wonderful and inspiring place, over the intervening years, owe him a great debt of gratitude and it is for that reason we celebrate with him here today.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve.

Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use.

Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27408  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nFormer Louth TD and republican ex-prisoner Paddy Agnew was in Leinster House for the first time today, 37 years after being elected. \nPaddy Agnew was one of three republican prisoners elected during the 1981 hunger strikes while imprisoned in Long Kesh and taking part in the blanker protest. \nHe was elected in the 1981 general election, topping the poll in the Louth constituency.

It has created uncertainty and trepidation in sections of our community and for others an anticipation of constitutional change. \n\"So even without a specific timeframe, it is becoming apparent to a growing cross-section of opinion that partition is running out of road.\" \n\nThe Derry man also said all sections of society should be preparing for such constitutional change. \n\"A refusal to discuss or engage in preparations for such seismic change would be a wilful dereliction of duty and risks a return to the bad old days. \n\"The outworking of these dynamics, however, need not be a threat. in reality the reinforce the imperative for political engagement and dialogue.

A sculpture, perhaps modelled on the Washington Memorial Wall, on which could be inscribed the names of every person killed as a result of the 30 years war that ended in 1998.
