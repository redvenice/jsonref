In the past 10 years it has gradually got worse and worse.’Mr Titley said he hopes the tunnel entrance to the lake will now become a habitat for bats. ‘It’s 35 to 40 yards long and would be the ideal location for them. I hope I’ve preserved the lake for future generations as a nature reserve,’ he added.A letter from the local council earlier this year threatening to prosecute him for fly tipping over the rubbish proved the final straw.                                          After it emerged the quarry had been sealed off, scores of tourists took to social media with their memories of previous visits to the beauty spotThe council sent Mr Titley the notice because he, as landowner, is deemed legally responsible for rubbish at the site.He said: ‘I was threatened with court action for fly tipping four or five months ago by trading standards because they couldn’t find out who had dropped the rubbish and it was on my land. That was the last straw. I cleaned it up myself.’Last week, the farmer decided ‘enough is enough’ and decided to fill in the access tunnel. He said: ‘Thirty years ago they respected the place. It is a beautiful beauty spot and it has just been trashed. It’s private land in the middle of my farm. They are destroying the land.’After it emerged the entrance had been sealed off, tourists took to social media to share their memories of visits to the beauty spot.Helen Woodley wrote: \u0027I remember asking mum and dad to drive home from Fairbourne beach to our caravan via the lake on many occasions on our childhood holidays more than thirty years ago.          The land owner reported a rise in dogs chasing sheep at the site (pictured after he filled the entrance in) as people head out to the countryside from the city          Beer bottles are strewn across the site in Friog (pictured).

They say my hands were forced.’Leigh Pocock, 20, a student living nearby who regularly visited the lake to swim and walk, told how its closure was ‘quite gutting’. But he said: ‘It was bound to happen. Tourists ruined it.’A spokesman for Wild Swim Snowdonia, whose members used the old quarry, said: ‘We understand the farmer has reached the end of his tether and we don’t blame him for that and respect his decision.’Louise Hughes, a local councillor, said about 40 bags of rubbish had been removed from the ‘astonishingly beautiful’ site in recent weeks.She said some visitors had ‘no regard for the environment’, adding: ‘It’s got steadily worse.

Symon Basterfield (pictured above) had been one of the children in the original documentary and had also appeared in 49 Up which aired in 2005She said: \u0027In America I went with Michael to a film festival and the Americans absolutely love this programme.\u0027She added: \u0027They said they had been watching me since I was seven years old.\u0027In 2012 the show returned with musician Pete Davies coming back to the show, after being one of the participants to have quit.Mr Davies had been on the sidelines since he withdrew from the show after 28 Up was aired in 1984. At 28, Mr Davies was a disillusioned teacher and he decided to quit after his angry criticism of the Thatcher government provoked a vitriolic response.He rejoined his contemporaries after agreeing to a request by director Michael Apted. At the time Mr Davies said: \u0027They decided they were going to portray me as the angry young Red in Thatcher\u0027s England.\u0027I was absolutely taken aback, genuinely shocked, at the level of ill-will directed towards me.\u0027Mr Davies said he was so scarred by the experience that he stopped watching the series.In the new series, celebrity fans look back to their very contrasting school days. Sally Lindsay and John Thomson recall their teenage trials and triumphs.          Stanley Johnson (pictured above) holds a picture of himself as a young boy in 1964 as he talks about his views on parenthood for the new documentary 7UP and me         Julia Bradbury holds a picture of herself as a young girl in 1964, as she appears on the show set to air next monthLord Sebastian Coe compares his sporting dreams with those of would be jockey Tony in the Up series, while Michael Sheen remembers the moment when his hopes of a football career ended. Stanley Johnson, Eamonn Holmes and Julia Bradbury share their contrasting views on parenthood.Sir Tony Robinson and Ben Bailey Smith explain which characters in the Up documentaries made the biggest impact on them. This is while William Roache, Rula Lenska and Baroness Tanni Grey Thompson reflect on the sadness of losing their parents.

Now the time has come again to see what has become of the participants, who are now aged 56.In 2012 the latest documentary, to be shown documented where the children are now, nearly 50 years after they were first aired to the public as fresh-faced school pupils who wanted to be astronauts, jockeys or missionaries.         Reunited decades on: Seven Up participants, clockwise from top left, Sue, John, Jackie, Bruce, Neil, Lynn, Nick, Tony, Symon and PaulThe idea for the programme was inspired by the Jesuit saying: \u0027Give me the child until he is seven and I will show you the man.\u0027 And for at least some of the children involved, their lives have panned out as they thought it would.Jackie Bassett, one of the girls picked from London\u0027s East End to represent the working classes, admitted to The Guardian, \u0027I\u0027ve turned out pretty much as expected\u0027.Married at 24, she was orced by her thirties, after which she faced single parenthood when she had a son, Charlie (the identity of his father she has never revealed). She went on to have a new relationship with partner Ian, with whom she had two more sons but they also separated.         Three little girls: Friends Jackie, Lynn and Susan, aged seven. Jackie thinks her life panned out \u0027as expected\u0027         Girls on film: Friends Jackie, Lynn and Susan, pictured at 14, have been followed by the cameras throughout their lives and have remained friendsMeanwhile, Bruce Bladen, who was a pupil at a prestigious boarding school when the show first aired in 1964, has not deviated too far from the environs of his youth as he is now a maths teacher at a respected private school in Hertfordshire. Aged seven, he said he wanted to become a missionary and he achieved his dream in sorts when he taught in Bangladesh after graduating from Oxford.Another of the Seven Up subjects, Symon Basterfield, who was in a care home from a young age, said he felt he and the other children were expected to fit the mould of their backgrounds, when they were first filmed.\u0027We (the children in care) were supposed to have aspirations to what we wanted in life, but the boys from wealthy backgrounds were encouraged to say their lives were plotted and planned. It was all hopes and dreams for us, but their lives were mapped out.\u0027         When I grow up: Charles Furneaux, left, went on to make documentaries of his own                     Giving back: Symon was in care when the show first aired and is now a foster parent himselfSymon\u0027s life began turbulently, he never knew his father and as a child of a mixed race relationship, he was often exposed to prejudice. He married and had five children but was orced by his thirties and badly affected by the loss of his mother, who died when he was 35. This meant he didn\u0027t take part in the documentary 35 Up. \u0027It\u0027s a period I don\u0027t want to talk about,\u0027 he said.He has since gone on to remarry and have another child and now works as freight handler. He and his second wife are foster parents at their home near Heathrow and have cared for more than 60 vulnerable children over the years.Like Symon, the life of Neil Hughes has taken turns that could never have been predicted. When he first featured appeared on television as a bright seven-year-old at his suburban school in Liverpool, he endearingly said: \u0027When I grow up I want to be an astronaut but if I can’t I think I’ll be a coach driver.\u0027                     Ups and downs: Neil Hughes had dreams of becoming an astronaut. He was a university drop out and homeless before turning his life around and running as an MPLater documentaries showed Neil had failed in his dreams to reach Oxford University and by his early twenties, he had dropped out of Aberdeen University and lived in a squat. Throughout his 30s, he struggled to earn a living and spent time homeless or on council estates in Scotland. However, he has since turned his life around and became a district councillor in Cumbria before standing as the Liberal Democrat candidate for Carlisle in the 2010 general election, where he finished third.Meanwhile, other participants did achieve their dreams. Tony Walker, who came from London\u0027s East End, did manage to become a jockey, albeit briefly, and raced against Lester Piggott before becoming a taxi driver. And Charles Furneaux, one of three boys followed from a Kensington prep school, went on to make documentaries of his own, most successfully as a producer of \u0027Touching the Void\u0027.For Michael Apted, who began as a researcher on the documentary and went on to become director, the unpredictable nature of the participants lives is what has made the Up series an important social experiment as well as unmissable viewing over the decades.                     Varied life: Aged seven, left, Tony Walker said he wanted to be a jockey. He achieved his dream before becoming a taxi driver\u0027You\u0027re fearful when you go back that bad things have happened,\u0027 he told The Guardian about what it is like catching up with the Up members at seven year intervals. \u0027That\u0027s the documentarian\u0027s curse. You want good things to happen to everybody, but you also want good stories.\u0027He adds that while some of the children involved have opted out in taking part in various stages of the documentary over the years, the majority have remained involved and have become like a family.                     \u0027I\u0027ve turned out pretty much as I expected\u0027: Jackie Bassett has left the East End for Scotland and was a single mum who says she\u0027s had a good life\u0027Some of us are close, some of us aren\u0027t close. Some of them like me, some of them don\u0027t. A family is a very good image of what this is, because we have been together for almost 50 years now.\u0027They have also been fortunate that accident or illness has not yet claimed the lives of those involved.\u0027When we lose somebody it\u0027ll make the others think very hard about doing it again,\u0027 admits the show\u0027s producer Claire Lewis. \u0027I don\u0027t know what effect that would have on us and on them. It\u0027s very hard watching yourself grow old on screen.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Delivery driver drops takeaway loses trousers friendly dog chases road","story":"          An unwitting delivery driver arrives at Zoe Keenan\u0027s house with food from Tony\u0027s Pizza \u0026amp Kebab HouseBut when the unwitting driver rings the doorbell, he starts to hear barking from inside and retreats to his car.All of a sudden, a Springador named Bruno bolts out of the front door and bounds on to the street.  The driver, who had been holding a plastic bag containing the takeaway, immediately throws it to the ground and starts to flee the friendly dog.

He finally went public last week to confirm he would run.Never far from the limelight the father-of-four recently split from his wife Marina and is in a relationship with former Conservative staffer Carrie Symonds, 20 years his junior. As an increasingly hawkish Brexiteer who says we should not be afraid of leaving without a deal he is hugely popular with the party faithful.At the start of the year he underwent what might be deemed a \u0027prime ministerial\u0027 makeover, losing weight and taming his unruly mop of blonde hair.Popular with the rank-and-file membership he has less fans in the parliamentary party and may face a concerted campaign to block his succession. Dominic Raab: Brexiteer who quit rather than back Mrs May\u0027s deal             Dominic Raab has become a cheerleader for a hard Brexit since stepping down as Brexit secretary in NovemberShortlived Brexit secretary last year, replacing David Davis in the hot seat But walked in November over terms agreed by PMVoted for Brexit in 2016Leadership odds 41 Mr Raab, 45, is another Vote Leave member who became Brexit secretary after David Davis quit alongside Mr Johnson last July over the Chequers plan.But he lasted just a matter of months before he too jumped ship, saying he could not accept the terms of the deal done by the Prime Minister.Like Mr Johnson and Mr Davis he has become an increasingly hardline Brexiteer, sharing a platform with the DUP\u0027s Arlene Foster and suggesting we should not be afraid of a no-deal Brexit.The Esher and Walton MP\u0027s decision to quit in November, boosted his popularity with party members but he lacks the wider popular appeal of Mr Johnson.And like Mr Johnson he might benefit from having quit the Cabinet at an earlier stage and dissociating himself with the dying days of the May administration.  His odds have shortened as he is seen as possibly a more palatable alternative Brexiteer to Boris by MPs seeking to block Mr Johnson\u0027s run.He recently posed for a glossy photoshoot with wife Erika at their Surrey home.Michael Gove: The boomerang cabinet minister with a Machiavellian reputation         Michael Gove has made a remarkable political comeback after being sacked by Theresa May in 2016Leading Vote Leave figure in 2016 who now backs PM\u0027s Brexit dealFormer journalist, 51,  who stood for leadership in 2016Was sacked as education minister by Theresa MayLater returned as Environment MinisterLeadship odds 51A Brexiteer with a Machiavellian reputation after the 2016 leadership campaign in which he first supported Boris Johnson for the leadership and then stood against him, to their mutual disadvantage.The former education secretary -  sacked by Mrs May -  was rehabilitated to become a right-on environment secretary - complete with reusable coffee cups and a strong line on food standards after Brexit.Despite being a former lead figure in the Vote Leave campaign alongside Mr Johnson the former journalist and MP for Surrey Heath has swung behind Mrs May\u0027s Brexit deal -  which might count against him.Supports leaving with a deal and while he says a No deal Brexit would come with \u0027problems\u0027 he believes the country could get through it. Seen as one of the Cabinet\u0027s strongest political thinkers and having stood once it is unthinkable that he would not stand again.He will again be pitched against Mr Johnson in a battle for Brexiteer votes. Andrea Leadsom: May\u0027s former rival who finally decided she could take no more                 Ms Leadsom (pictured today) quit the cabinet yesterday.

which was very badly received in Brussels - and a gaffe in which he referred to his Chinese wife  as \u0027Japanese\u0027 as a reception in China.Last month he went on a tour of Africa in which his Chinese wife Lucia made a major appearance, after he gaffed by forgetting her nationality.Last week he called for a \u0027decisive\u0027 hike in defence spending to see off the rising threat from Russia and China – in a speech seen as a clear signal of his leadership ambitions. Speaking at the Lord Mayor\u0027s Banquet Mansion House in the City of London, he said the UK\u0027s hard power must be strengthened, with billions more spent on new capabilities to tackle drones and cyber attacks.Rory Stewart: Remainer rising star and friend of royals who is not short of confidence                    The father of two is married to Shoshana, whom he first met when they worked together in Iraq and she was already marriedPenrith MP, 46, is a former tutor to the Dukes of Cambridge and SussexOld Etonian ex-soldier worked for Foreign Office in Iraq and set up a charity for the Prince of Wale sin AfghanistanVoted for Remain and still backs a soft BrexitLeadership odds 161The former prisons minister who once vowed to quit if they did not improve within a year declared his candidacy almost as soon as he was promoted to the Cabinet.He stepped up to International Development Secretary earlier this month to replace Ms Mordaunt and days later declared he will run for the Tory leadership.The Theresa May loyalist praised the PM for her \u0027courageous effort\u0027 to pass her Brexit deal but admitted he would throw his hat in the ring when she steps down.Urging his party not to \u0027try to outdo Nigel Farage\u0027, the development secretary said the Tories should \u0027stretch all the way from Ken Clarke to Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0027.He also lashed out at Mr Johnson at the weekend, saying he would not serve under a No Deal-supporting PM. The Old Etonian former tutor to the Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex previously worked for the Foreign Office in Iraq and set up a charity for the Prince of Wales in Afghanistan.He has also written several books about walking. The father of two is married to Shoshana, whom he first met when they worked together in Iraq and she was already married.   Seen as highly intelligent his staunch Remainer and soft Brexit credentials look likely to count against him in a race set to be dominated by the Brexiteer wing of the party. Matt Hancock: Waffle-loving health secretary who wants Tories to choose a younger leader                    Mr Hancock took stroopwafels in for Cabinet the day after he was pulled up for eating them on televisionThe youngest front-runner at 40A Remainer who now backs Theresa May\u0027s Brexit dealHe wants the party to look to the future and attract younger votersLeadership odds 201The Health Secretary is, like his predecessor Jeremy Hunt, seen as something of a unity candidate.The 40-year-old father of three is seen as a safe pair of hands despite a few teething problems in his latest Cabinet role.Last year he was accused of breaking ethics rules after he praised a private health firm app in a newspaper article sponsored by its maker.But he has since made some hard-hitting interventions in areas like the impact of social media on health. Last month he joined Ms Mordaunt in backing the Generation Why? report showing that the Tories needed to become more relevant to younger voters. He called on the party to change its \u0027tone\u0027 towards modern Britain or face Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister, in a speech widely seen as setting out his leadership credentials.This week he showed his human side by unashamedly chomping calorific stroopwafels before a TV broadcast, saying he people should enjoy things in moderation. Penny Mordaunt: The highly regarded Brexiteer promoted to take on defence                Ms Mordaunt is an outsider for the leadership but is highly thought of in Brexiteer groupsThe MP for Portsmouth North is a Royal Navy reservistHighly regarded in Brexiteer circles She has been consistently tipped to quit over Brexit but remains in the Cabinet Once appeared in a swimsuit in a reality TV show Leadership odds 251 The new Defence Secretary - the first woman ever to hold the post - is highly regarded in Brexiteer circles. The Royal Navy reservist, 46, carved out a niche at International Development with some eye-catching suggests about changing how the UK spends disperses aid cash.She has become an increasingly serious politician after initially being seen as lighthearted when she appeared in a swimsuit in ITV reality TV show Splash!She was promoted earlier this month to replace Gavin Williamson when he was sacked for leaking details from a confidential meeting about Huawei.   Over the preceding few months she was at the heart of persistent rumours that she would be the next Brexit-supporting minister out the door over Brexit. She has yet to announce she is running but last month she backed a thinktank report saying the party needed to attract new voters.She said the party needed to \u0027act swiftly\u0027 to win over the younger generations who were turning away from the centre-Right in \u0027unprecedented\u0027 numbers. On Wednesday, after other Cabinet Brexiteers including Andrea Leadsom were notable by their absence during Prime Minister\u0027s Questions, she remained at her post. It remains to be seen whether this loyalty will count for or against her. Sajid Javid: Remainer star who has run into trouble over knife crime and refugees             Sajid Javid has seen his stock take a hit over the knife crime crisis and migrants crossing the English Channel in small boatsThe most senior cabinet contenderVoted Remain but wants to see Brexit deliveredFaced criticism as Home Secretary But has taken a hard line on Shamima Begum case Leadership odds 331The Home Secretary, a Remainer who wants to see Brexit delivered, was the leading candidate from inside the Cabinet to replace Mrs May.After replacing Amber Rudd last year he consciously put clear ground between himself and the Prime Minister on issues like caps on skilled migrants after Brexit.But his credentials have taken a hit recently. He finds himself facing ongoing criticism of his handling of the knife crime crisis affecting UK cities, which sparked a Cabinet row over funding for police.He also lost face over his handling of the influx of migrants crossing the English Channel in January, being seen to move slowly in realising the scale of the problem.But more recently the 49-year-old Bromsgove MP has made a serious of hardline decision designed to go down well with Tory voters. Most notably they have included moving to deprive London teenager turned Jihadi bride Shamima Begum, 19, of her British citizenship, after she was discovered among former Islamic State members in a Syrian refugee camp. Steve Baker: Brexiteer \u0027Spartan\u0027 and self-styled \u0027hardman\u0027 who refused to budge over Brexit               Brexit \u0027hardman\u0027 Steve Baker has previously threatened to leave the Tories over BrexitFormer Brexit minister who resigned last yearA member of the European Research Group which has has opposed Theresa May\u0027s deal in every voteThreatened to quit the Tories over Brexit earlier this yearLeadership odds 331 The High Wycombe MP, 47, is a Brexit purist who has never backed Theresa May\u0027s deal.In March he even threatened to quit the party over the issue, saying: \u0027We\u0027ve been put in this place by people whose addiction to power without responsibility has led them to put the choice of No Brexit or this deal.\u0027I may yet resign the whip than be part of this.\u0027The married former RAF engineer officer described himself as a \u0027hardman\u0027 in a TV interview this year, only to be shown shortly afterwards in a documentary crying in his office.Today he told the BBC: \u0027There is no point shying away from it, people have been asking me to stand.

She has no children.This week she set out her leadership pitch by calling for the party to use £7billion of foreign aid cash on buckling British police forces and schools.Launching a \u0027blue collar conservatism\u0027 campaign the Brexiteer MP, 51, said her party had \u0027lost the trust\u0027 of working people by failing to leave the EU already and must pursue \u0027radical conservative agendas\u0027 to win it back\u0027.She said that keeping cash in the UK that is currently sent abroad would allow an increase of £4billion in spending on schools and £3billion for police, which are both demanding more money.And she declined to rule out doing a post-election deal with Nigel Farage - but said that if the Tories got the UK out it would mean that his Brexit Party would have no reason to exist. Speaking in Westminster she reiterated her call for the next party leader to be \u0027someone who believes in Brexit\u0027 - a dig at Mrs May, who supported the Remain campaign in 2016. Kit Malthouse: Self-proclaimed peacemaker who says it is time for a \u0027new generation\u0027 to take charge Known for his efforts to forge a compromise between Tory Brexit factions Entered the Commons in David Cameron\u0027s 2015 election victory Served as deputy to Boris Johnson when he was Mayor of London Leadership odds 1001           Kit Malthouse, who was elected to the Commons in 2015, says it is time for a new generation of politicians to take charge of the Conservative PartyHousing minister Kit Malthouse is best known for his abortive efforts to forge a joint position between Tory Remainers and Brexiteers - which would essentially have meant leaving the EU more slowly but with looser trade ties.It was modestly labelled as the \u0027Malthouse Compromise\u0027.Now the 52-year-old, who was elected to the Commons in 2015, says it is time for a new generation of politicians to take charge of the Conservative Party. Previously the Liverpool-born father-of-three served as a deputy to Boris Johnson when he was Mayor of London. He says his core offer in the contest is a new social contract, \u0027a good job, a secure home and a brilliant school.

Their destruction, fuelled by rampant consumption and obsession with economic growth, is accelerating.“The evidence is crystal clear: nature is in trouble. Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away. We can’t really afford this level of disengagement when we need to be getting on with things.”Scheer is brutally frank about future voters born today. “I don’t think people get a choice of what games they play.”They will have to be focused on survival. “It feels as we have handed them a shitstorm.”As for the current generation, too many are stuck in business-as-usual mode. There is a need to raise consciousness quickly. “Ignorance is not a choice” given the IPBES report. “It’s not an opinion, it’s scientific. It’s happening.”Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Daly on way to Brussels after securing third seat, leaving Andrews in \u0026lsquocold storage\u0026rsquo until BrexitVictim attacked at about 3.30pm, with garda\u0026iacute and paramedics dispatched to the sceneNew legislation means for first time vote will continue to determine ranking of last seatsStance \u0026lsquoa serious a failure of judgment and abdication of responsibility\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash Green leaderOne-third of local authority homes exposed to \u0026lsquosewage invasion\u0026rsquo and rodentsMan also falsely claimed two mortars were set for Dublin CastleHighest values to crest 19 degrees on Friday with mixed outlook for Saturday and SundayDriver was in car with his three children when it collided with an articulated truckInjured party was knocked out and suffered fractured jaw and black eyePassenger on flight from Rome to Krakow suffered significant scald burns, court toldChild suffered \u0026lsquolaceration to the head from trolley pushed by another child\u0026rsquo at Dundrum Town CentreTotal of 107 candidates running in 55-seat constituencyExpedition company says family of Kevin Hynes (56) consulted over Facebook posts celebrating colleagues\u0026rsquo featsAll services have resumed Up to 30 minute delays expected as manual system in placeTaoiseach reassures Cabinet he does not want a general election soonAgnes Thomas tells court in Paris she warned her friend against meeting \u0026lsquoweird guy\u0026rsquoJudicial review proceedings underway in a bid to have the warrants declared unlawfulMan was charged with withholding information in connection with Sligo killing"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3907335.1559058469!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bank holiday weather sunny southeast set to live up to name","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHook Head lighthouse in Co Wexford.

But the dominant language used by the weather service is of “changeable conditions” likely “to continue over the weekend”.Bank holiday Monday\u0027s weather to followBut what of tonight? On Tuesday outbreaks of rain are expected to spread from the southwest, reaching most areas except Ulster by morning. Minimum temperatures are expected to be six to nine degrees in light to moderate mainly southeast winds, later veering southwest along Munster and south Leinster coasts and freshening.Bank Holiday WeekendFriday The day should start largely dry in the east with some cheerful spells but rain will spread eastwards across the country through the course of the afternoon and evening. The best of the weather will be in parts of the southeast and this may hold dry. Highest temperatures will be 16 to 19 degrees with moderate to fresh southwesterly breezes.Saturday At present the day looks like being dry with bright or sunny spells, but cloudier conditions with outbreaks of rain are likely through the afternoon and evening.

Highest temperatures are forecast in the range of 15 to 18 degrees with the east of the country to be the warmest. South to southeast breezes will be moderateSunday  Current indications suggest a brighter day with showers in the mix.

However good dry spells should develop in inland parts of Munster and across the southern half of Leinster with maximum temperatures 14 to 19 degrees, warmest in the south.Thursday is expected to again be dull with more outbreaks of rain and drizzle. Heavy bursts are expected to occur in the west and north. The best of the drier weather will be in the east and south where a few “limited” warm sunny spells should occur.Highest temperatures of 16 to 19 degrees, but possibly reaching into the twenties under any longer sunny breaks and it will be warmest across Leinster. By nightfall more rain should feature, particularly in Connacht and Ulster and parts of North Leinster. But elsewhere it is expected to be mostly dry apart from the odd patch of drizzle.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireIndependents 4 Change TD Clare Daly and Fianna Fáil’s Barry Andrews have taken the final two MEP seats in Dublin.Ms Daly took the third seat with a final total of 87,770 votes and Mr Andrews the fourth seat with 68,952.Sinn Féin’s Lynn Boylan was eliminated from the Dublin European Parliament constituency after the 15th count.Following a row marked by the suspension of the count last night, it was decided to distribute her votes instead of automatically electing the remaining two candidates.This was done in order to determine who would take the third seat and fourth seats.This is important because the fourth seat is effectively in limbo due to the Brexit impasse and the person who secures this seat will not able to take it until the UK leaves the European Union.Meanwhile in Ireland South sitting Fine Gael MEP and former GAA president Seán Kelly has been elected. Mr Kelly may well be the only candidate elected in the constituency on Tuesday, having exceeded the quota of 119,883.Mr Kelleher and Mick Wallace look set to win seats with the remaining candidates in a dog fight to claim the two remaining spots.Andrews calls for recountEarlier on Tuesday, a recount was called for in Dublin by Mr Andrews of the 14th count, in which the votes for Labour Party candidate Alex White were distributed.Speaking in the RDS on Tuesday afternoon, Mr Andrews said: “The recount is out of an abundance of caution. We wanted clarity . . . Nobody wants a cloud hanging over anybody’s mandate.”Mr Andrews did not rule out legal action. He also noted that a similar situation may develop in Ireland South where the remaining two candidates will want to know who finished fourth and fifth in order to determine who goes to Europe first.“There are doubts in the South as to how that will proceed. It would be far too early to be ruling anything in or out,” he said.Mr Andrews said, ideally, he would prefer to go Europe straight away rather than waiting until the UK leaves the EU.Matters were further complicated when the Minister responsible for the new law became confused about the legal rules.Minister of State for Electoral Reform John Paul Phelan said on RTÉ’s Today with Seán O’Rourke show he had made a mistake in earlier comments about the legislation.He said, initially, that Ms Boylan’s votes should be excluded before clarifying his remarks.“In order to determine the positioning of candidates that has to be done for the first time in this particular European election.”Last night, when the Dublin count was suspended, Ms Daly indicated the issue may end up in court.“Clearly they want time to think on it and not rush it. There was an issue when Fianna Fáil swept in here,” she said.Ireland SouthIn Ireland South no candidate has reached the quota apart from Mr Kelly. The sitting Fine Gael MEP said he was pleased to top the poll, particularly given that his party fielded three candidates.Mick Wallace, a TD for Wexford, said he will remain “a thorn in the side” of the Government even if he secures a seat in the European Parliament. Mr Wallace said he expected to pick up a lot of votes on transfers.The tenth count has been completed in Ireland Southy, resulting in the elimination of Independent Breda Gardner.Midlands North WestIn Midlands North West sitting MEP Luke Ming Flanagan is on course to take the second seat in the constituency, but it could be tomorrow before he’s elected.After the sixth count he’s on 87,964 – more than 20,000 short of the quota but he is ahead of Matt Carthy, Maria Walsh and Peter Casey. Armed with a clip board and the figures Mr Flanagan said he was sure of a seat.Mr Carthy, on 79,028 votes after count six, is predicting “a battle to the end. It’s going to go down to the last count with Maria Walsh, Saoirse McHugh, Peter Casey and Brendan Smith all there,” he said.On Monday, Ms McGuinness was the first of 13 Irish MEPs elected. The 59-year-old sitting MEP, first elected to the European Parliament in 2004, received 134,630 first-preference votes, exceeding the quota by some 16,000 votes in the four-seater constituency.Local electionsIn the local elections, just six seats remain to be filled, one each in Cork County and Wicklow and four in Longford.The Green Party was the big winner having recorded its best election results to date while Sinn Féin was the big loser. Sinn Féin lost seats on councils all over the country – and was wiped out on some local authorities – in a big reversal of fortunes compared to the last such elections five years ago.The party has seen its councillors fall from 159 in 2014 to 81.Full profiles and in depth analysis of the European election"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3906267.1558987411!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"scottish results an emphatic rejection of brexit says sturgeon","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon meets Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at Farmleigh House during her visit to Dublin. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThe Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has called the results of the European elections in Scotland an “emphatic rejection of Brexit” after talks in Dublin with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.Ms Sturgeon said she was “pretty jubilant” about the results of the European elections in Scotland, where her party the SNP took three of the six seats, an improvement of one, and 20 per cent ahead of its nearest rivals.She met Mr Varadkar for talks that covered Brexit and other issues at Farmleigh today during a one-day visit to Dublin.She said the two leaders also discussed health policy, the citizens’ assembly and the economic links between the two countries.“But inevitably discussions were dominated by Brexit,” Ms Sturgeon told The .“The chances of a no-deal Brexit have increased but the chances of no Brexit have also increased,” she said. “And it’s hard to predict which one of those will be the outcome. But there’s every reason to believe the good outcome will prevail over the bad outcome.”Does she think the UK will leave?“I don’t know . . . but what I would say is I’m more hopeful than I’ve been up until now that there is a path to remaining through a second EU referendum,” she said. “I think there’s everything to play for.”Brexit a ‘disaster’Is Brexit an opportunity to push the SNP’s independence agenda?“I don’t see Brexit as an opportunity because I think it’s a disaster for Scotland. I think Scotland will become independent even if Brexit never happens. It may become independent a bit more quickly now because of Brexit, and I think what Brexit has exposed in the UK – the democratic deficit, the way Scotland’s interests have been so easily disregarded – has been eye-opening to a lot of people in Scotland. So I do think that the Brexit experience makes Scottish independence even more likely, and probably more likely to happen more quickly,” Ms Sturgeon said.She will introduce legislation in the Scottish Parliament this week to put the rules in place for a referendum to take place, she said. It is likely to take place next year. She is convinced it will pass.“In no small measure what we’ve witnessed in the past three years of Ireland’s experience of being influential and being supported by the European Union, while Scotland has been treated rather contemptuously by Westminster – I think that starts to shape people’s opinion and demonstrates to people the benefits of being, yes, a small country, but an independent country within the European Union,” she said.Full profiles and in depth analysis of the European election"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletMinistry of JusticeNearly five million children and young people at risk of measles across EuropeNicola Sturgeon\u0026#39s call for indyref2 next year dismissed as a \u0026#39stunt\u0026#39Comment: Labour\u0026#39s mindless attack on energy markets would ruin a great British success storyBrexit latest news: Alastair Campbell expelled from Labour Party after backing Lib Dems at European electionsMother and daughter sue France for failing to protect them against Paris air pollution in legal firstGo running over cycling to avoid brittle bones, men toldThe last ever film footage of Queen Victoria discovered as BFI finds 1900 image of smiling monarch in MoMA archives Early humans learnt to walk on two feet rather than all fours due to \u0026#39bombardment of exploding stars\u0026#39Italy\u0026#39s Salvini seizes on sweeping election win to demand big concessions from  BrusselsHow a triumphant Matteo Salvini plans to build a new coalition of eurosceptics with Nigel Farage and Marine Le PenFormer JLS singer cleared of raping fan after court sees CCTV footage of pair \u0026#39acting like couple\u0026#39 outside club Comment: If the Brexit Party is serious about a general election, this is what its manifesto should beHells Angels anniversary London to Brighton trip prompts two police forces to cancel all holidays Moped gang armed with machetes storm luxury West End watch shop as customers hide in vaultComment: Conservatives are paying the price across Europe for aping populist EuroscepticsSydney imposes first water restrictions in decade after crippling droughtNew Forest Commoners take on Forestry England over \u0026#39disgraceful\u0026#39 home rent rise Comment: Far from humbling Macron, the European election results will only make him more unbearableLabour anti-Semitism sees party join BNP in being probed by human rights watchdogWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/05/13/TELEMMGLPICT000196956429_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6B56EokmwVz8yO1uUcPB99UIvfx6lPoez-YFK6IWJbE.jpeg?imwid","title":"rollout facial recognition technology has terrifying implications","story":"San Francisco has banned the use of facial recognition technology by police – should Britain follow suit?Our MPs have some front.

By 2000 this figure dropped to almost 28,000.The country has now seen no new infections since 2013 and is the first nation in WHO Africa region to be declared malaria-free in more than 40 years – only  Mauritius, which achieved the goal in 1973, has also eliminated the disease in the region. “Algeria is where the malaria parasite was first discovered in humans almost a century and a half ago, and that was a significant milestone in responding to the disease,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti WHO regional director for Africa.“Now Algeria has shown the rest of Africa that malaria can be beaten through country leadership, bold action, sound investment and science. The rest of the continent can learn from this experience,” she said. War on malaria | On the brink of a breakthrough?Algeria\u0027s success has been due to a combination of free malaria diagnosis and treatment and a well-trained health workforce. Similar factors have helped Argentina eradicate the parasitic disease – the second country in South America to do so following Paraguay last year. “Argentina reported the last indigenous case in 2010 and has demonstrated the commitment, the capacity within its health, laboratory and surveillance systems, and the necessary financing to prevent the re-establishment of malaria within the country”, said Dr Carissa F. Etienne, director of the WHO Pan American Health Organization.“I am sure that Argentina will serve as an inspiration and as an example for other countries of the Americas to achieve the elimination of malaria in the coming years,” she added. India and Rwanda have made huge progress in tackling malariaAccording to the 2018 World Malaria Report, China is also close to eradicating the disease and Rwanda, Ethiopia and Pakistan have reduced infection levels. The countries are a highlights in an otherwise gloomy global picture. The countries with the highest disease burden are all moving backwards, including Nigeria, DRC, Mozambique and Uganda.“The news that Algeria and Argentina have been declared malaria free is a remarkable achievement for both countries,” said Dr Abdourahmane Diallo, CEO of the RBM Partnership to End Malaria.“As well as saving precious lives and strengthening health systems, malaria-free status provides external economic benefits for these countries enabling them to free up resources to address other health and development priorities and improve worker productivity and school attendance.“Other countries now have two more nations that serve as examples of how elimination can be achieved,” Dr Diallo added.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Speeding driver saved by \u0026#39ine intervention\u0026#39 after dove obscures his face on cameraNearly five million children and young people at risk of measles across EuropeNicola Sturgeon\u0026#39s call for indyref2 next year dismissed as a \u0026#39stunt\u0026#39Comment: Labour\u0026#39s mindless attack on energy markets would ruin a great British success storyBrexit latest news: Alastair Campbell expelled from Labour Party after backing Lib Dems at European electionsMother and daughter sue France for failing to protect them against Paris air pollution in legal firstGo running over cycling to avoid brittle bones, men toldThe last ever film footage of Queen Victoria discovered as BFI finds 1900 image of smiling monarch in MoMA archives Early humans learnt to walk on two feet rather than all fours due to \u0026#39bombardment of exploding stars\u0026#39Italy\u0026#39s Salvini seizes on sweeping election win to demand big concessions from  BrusselsHow a triumphant Matteo Salvini plans to build a new coalition of eurosceptics with Nigel Farage and Marine Le PenFormer JLS singer cleared of raping fan after court sees CCTV footage of pair \u0026#39acting like couple\u0026#39 outside club Comment: If the Brexit Party is serious about a general election, this is what its manifesto should beHells Angels anniversary London to Brighton trip prompts two police forces to cancel all holidays Moped gang armed with machetes storm luxury West End watch shop as customers hide in vaultComment: Conservatives are paying the price across Europe for aping populist EuroscepticsSydney imposes first water restrictions in decade after crippling droughtNew Forest Commoners take on Forestry England over \u0026#39disgraceful\u0026#39 home rent rise Comment: Far from humbling Macron, the European election results will only make him more unbearableLabour anti-Semitism sees party join BNP in being probed by human rights watchdogWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"expenses podcast lone campaigner took whole parliament","story":"Journalist and freedom of information campaigner, Heather BrookeTucked away in the back of New Labour’s 1997 manifesto is a promise.

The vote on Sunday was a huge demand for change.”He called for an EU conference to discuss job creation, investment, economic growth and the role of the European Central Bank.Mr Salvini’s defiant stance came amid reports that Brussels is preparing to sanction Italy over its debt levels and could impose a massive financial penalty of €3.5 billion.The European Commission is expected to send Italy a letter on Wednesday asking for clarification on how the debt is being managed.Mr Salvini mocked such notices as “little letters” and said he would ignore them.European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs Pierre Moscovici Pierre Moscovici, the EU Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, confirmed that a letter was on its way.“I am going to exchange views with the Italian government on additional measures that might be required in order for them to be compliant with the rules,’’ he said on Tuesday at a conference near Lisbon. “It’s quite likely that we will have an exchange of letters.”Any discussion about fining Italy could come next week as part of a routine budget monitoring process carried out by the EU.It would significantly up the ante in the confrontation between Brussels and Italy’s populist coalition.In his Facebook address, Mr Salvini railed against critics in Italy who, he said, characterise League voters as “Fascists, racists and Nazis.”Please review our commenting policyComment: Labour\u0026#39s mindless attack on energy markets would ruin a great British success storyBrexit latest news: Alastair Campbell expelled from Labour Party after backing Lib Dems at European electionsMother and daughter sue France for failing to protect them against Paris air pollution in legal firstGo running over cycling to avoid brittle bones, men toldThe last ever film footage of Queen Victoria discovered as BFI finds 1900 image of smiling monarch in MoMA archives Early humans learnt to walk on two feet rather than all fours due to \u0026#39bombardment of exploding stars\u0026#39How a triumphant Matteo Salvini plans to build a new coalition of eurosceptics with Nigel Farage and Marine Le PenFormer JLS singer cleared of raping fan after court sees CCTV footage of pair \u0026#39acting like couple\u0026#39 outside club Comment: If the Brexit Party is serious about a general election, this is what its manifesto should beHells Angels anniversary London to Brighton trip prompts two police forces to cancel all holidays Moped gang armed with machetes storm luxury West End watch shop as customers hide in vaultComment: Conservatives are paying the price across Europe for aping populist EuroscepticsSydney imposes first water restrictions in decade after crippling droughtNew Forest Commoners take on Forestry England over \u0026#39disgraceful\u0026#39 home rent rise Comment: Far from humbling Macron, the European election results will only make him more unbearableLabour anti-Semitism sees party join BNP in being probed by human rights watchdogDoctors install replica bus stop inside hospital\u0026#39s emergency department to help dementia patients feel more relaxed Vince Cable now wields more power and influence in Brussels than Theresa MayComment: Tory leader hopefuls still don\u0026#39t get that being ready for no-deal is the only way out of this messWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/28/TELEMMGLPICT000198909899_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNJjoeBT78QIaYdkJdEY4CnGTJFJS74MYhNY6w3GNbO8.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"last ever film footage queen victoria discovered bfi finds 1900","story":"Queen Victoria can be seen smilingIsle of WightShe is known for not being amused, but a rare video of Queen Victoria smiling, thought to be the last ever footage of the monarch, has been discovered by the Museum of Modern Art in New York.The incredibly crisp and clear film shows a close-up of the Queen wearing sunglasses as she visited Ireland in 1900, just before she died in 1901.The grinning monarch seemed to be sheltering from the sun, sporting sunglasses and carrying a parasol.She can be seen smiling as she is given flowers from two curtsying girls as the crowds flocked to see her ride past in her carriage.Bryony Dixon, curator of the British Film Institute, said it was a fitting last clip of Queen Victoria, who had been at the forefront of technical changes during her rule.She added: I nearly fell off my chair because I\u0027d never seen Victoria in close-up before.It is completely unique because you can see the Queen\u0027s face for the first time properly since 1900, since this was shown.. ...you can see her expressions, you can see her in movement, rather than just as a stiff portrait or a still photograph.It\u0027s very rare to see her smiling. She doesn\u0027t in any of her portraits, so it humanises her, I think, for the first time. In 1939, the New York museum acquired a treasure of thirty-six reels of 68mm nitrate prints and negatives made in cinema’s first years. This included the rare footage of Queen Victoria.Ms Dixon added: Queen Victoria was always very up to date with technology and she was interested in art.She was interested in photography in particular so here, instead of a posed photo or painting, we see her in movement.The 200th birthday of Queen Victoria is currently being celebrated by institutions across the globe.This week, passionate birthday presents exchanged between the monarch and Prince Albert have gone on display at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, which the couple used as a private home away from court life. The gifts include a white marble statue depicting a nude female figure seated on a rock, and a painting of women in various states of undress.Isle of WightComment: Labour\u0026#39s mindless attack on energy markets would ruin a great British success storyBrexit latest news: Alastair Campbell expelled from Labour Party after backing Lib Dems at European electionsMother and daughter sue France for failing to protect them against Paris air pollution in legal firstGo running over cycling to avoid brittle bones, men toldEarly humans learnt to walk on two feet rather than all fours due to \u0026#39bombardment of exploding stars\u0026#39Italy\u0026#39s Salvini seizes on sweeping election win to demand big concessions from  BrusselsHow a triumphant Matteo Salvini plans to build a new coalition of eurosceptics with Nigel Farage and Marine Le PenFormer JLS singer cleared of raping fan after court sees CCTV footage of pair \u0026#39acting like couple\u0026#39 outside club Comment: If the Brexit Party is serious about a general election, this is what its manifesto should beHells Angels anniversary London to Brighton trip prompts two police forces to cancel all holidays Moped gang armed with machetes storm luxury West End watch shop as customers hide in vaultComment: Conservatives are paying the price across Europe for aping populist EuroscepticsSydney imposes first water restrictions in decade after crippling droughtNew Forest Commoners take on Forestry England over \u0026#39disgraceful\u0026#39 home rent rise Comment: Far from humbling Macron, the European election results will only make him more unbearableLabour anti-Semitism sees party join BNP in being probed by human rights watchdogDoctors install replica bus stop inside hospital\u0026#39s emergency department to help dementia patients feel more relaxed Vince Cable now wields more power and influence in Brussels than Theresa MayComment: Tory leader hopefuls still don\u0026#39t get that being ready for no-deal is the only way out of this messWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"moped gang armed machetes storm luxury west end watch shop customers","story":"An armed moped gang targeted a luxury West End watch shop on Tuesday morning, as customers - including an extended member of the Royal family - were locked inside a vault to escape the violent robbery. The front window was smashed at The Hour House, in Duke Street, near Oxford Street in central London while a moped was left abandoned on the pavement.Made In Chelsea star Spencer Matthews - who is Pippa Middleton\u0027s brother-in-law - was in the shop with two friends when he was forced to hide in the vault as the robbers struck.A group of six men on four mopeds stormed the shop with machetes and sledgehammers having driven one of their motorcycles into the front of the shop. While the customers and staff took cover, it\u0027s understood the thieves smashed display cases and took all but one watch from the shop, which stocks a number of Rolex\u0027s worth more than £10,000 each. Moped gang armed with machetes storm luxury West End watch shop as customers hide in vaultIn a post on Instagram, I\u0027m A Celebrity star Mr Matthews said: I just had to hide in a safe. More like a vault downstairs while this watch shop The Hour House on Duke Street got smashed to pieces by armed robbers.He posted pictures on the social media site of the glass-strewn shop and smashed cabinets. Matthews described the robbers wielding huge jack hammers.The socialite said: These guys drive a scooter through the glass and start battering the shop with hammers, big huge hammers, wearing helmets.We\u0027re in the back of the shop looking at them, sprint downstairs, hide in the vault until all the noise passes. Come upstairs and the place is just battered. Like I mean Gonzo. All the watches gone.He and his friends began looking for the vintage piece that Matthews had been hoping to collect.The 30-year-old went on: We were looking around and I\u0027m just thinking... the thing that I\u0027ve been waiting for has obviously just been nicked so I\u0027m going to have to go and get another one.Police outside The Hour House on Duke StreetLo and behold we look around and on the floor amongst all the rubble and the glass and stuff there\u0027s one watch in the entire shop and it\u0027s mine. Now if that\u0027s not luck I don\u0027t know what is.Thames Valley fire service engineer Paul Starck was in Duke Lane when the robbery took place and said he had never felt fear like that experienced when one of the men attacked his van window with a machete.He was driving near to the shop when the group did a U-turn on the road close to him, prompting him to call the police.That\u0027s what instigated them to have a go at me, he said.Mr Starck, 43, from Sandhurst, said one of the men came over and banged a machete against the window on the driver\u0027s side, smashing the glass.He was trying to get through the window at me because he knew I was on the phone to police, he said.I\u0027ve never been so scared in my life. He had no care in the world, the chap.He ran after a load of people that were standing here first of all, then he went for someone in a black car that was here.And then he obviously knew that I was on the phone to police and at that point I started to move off... and then he just went for me.The battered displays at The Hour HouseMr Starck said around five of the group went into the shop.One put a sledgehammer through the window in the front first of all, then it must have been three or four of them ran inside with weapons, he said, adding that the majority of the weapons were sledgehammers.Mr Starck said he got glass in his eye during the incident.Another witness, who did not want to be named, said one member of the group rammed the front door of the shop with a scooter and then two others started banging a second door with sledgehammers.He said one of the men chased him with a machete.It\u0027s not every day you come to work expecting someone to come at you with a machete, he said.The man said he was told by a police officer that a moped was found abandoned in Islington, which he said is believed to be one of the mopeds used in the robbery.The politan Police Twitter account for Westminster @MPSWestminster said that officers were called at around 10.32am on Tuesday.A series of tweets read: A number of males armed with weapons are reported to have driven to the premises on mopeds and smashed a window before stealing goods and fleeing.A man aged in his 30s has been treated by LAS for an eye injury sustained after the shop window was smashed.At this stage there have been no arrests.

The beaches along the Normandy coastline are still referred to on maps and signposts by their invasion codenames and numerous cemeteries marking the sacrifices of the men and women who gave their lives in the conflict can be found in the surrounding area.  To mark the D-Day landings, former Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson earlier this year wrote an open letter to veterans inviting them to take part in the 75th anniversary commemorations. In the letter, he wrote: “It is our intention that this June we show you, our special generation, that we will never forget the debt we owe for the peace and freedom we now enjoy.”It is of the utmost importance that we, the British public - as friends, relatives and descendants of the many brave soldiers who served our country - pay tribute to them and take the opportunity to celebrate their history, through stories and physical artefacts from the time, to understand those who lived through it and how it has impacted not only British, but world history.With that in mind, and to mark the 75th anniversary, the  is asking its readers to send us their stories passed down from D-Day. Many of our readers will have had relatives and loved ones who also worked, fought and lived through the battle, while others might even be survivors.It’s these stories we want to hear and to tell. Using your letters, keepsakes and memories we hope to create a snapshot of life during the conflict and a worthy tribute to those who fought, lived and made the ultimate sacrifice on those fateful days in history.Send your D-Day letters, documents and memories in text or image format to yourstory@telegraph for a chance to be featured in our commemorative project. We ask that readers do not send us physical items as we cannot guarantee their safe arrival or return.Submission of material is subject to our website terms and conditions which can be found here.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearWhatever the cause, analysts believe bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will continue to see more price gains in the coming months.A panel of cryptocurrency experts put together by finance firm Finder predicted bitcoin would be trading at around $9,659 by December 2019.Nearly half of the panellists also forecast that bitcoin’s current surge would see its price exceed its record high of close to $20,000, which it reached in December 2017.However, half of the panellists said the market surge would be followed by a similar price crash that occurred in 2018.\u0026nbspFor more than 12 months following its record high, bitcoin saw its price fall and stagnate before finally showing signs of recovery earlier this year.For bitcoin to maintain such a high value it will need to see advances in its usability as a form of mainstream currency, according to Fred\u0026nbspSchebsta, co-founder of cryptocurrency brokerage firm HiveEx,.While I believe bitcoin will rise a little further this year, usability still has a long way to go before real value will exist, he said.It is also possible that we may see another crash like what we saw in December 2017, when bitcoin dropped by roughly 40 per cent within a few days. But long-term, bitcoin and other digital currencies are very likely to stick around and change the way we do banking.The cryptocurrency may face competition from other digital currencies, rumoured to be in development by major tech companies like Facebook.Last week, details about Facebook\u0027s GlobalCoin cryptocurrency were revealed, pointing to a potential launch date of 2020.Why is Facebook launching its own cryptocurrency to rival bitcoin?If successful, Facebook would be able to use its user base of more than 2 billion people to\u0026nbsppush its growth to levels never seen by bitcoin.The launch of GlobalCoin is all about Facebook monetising its huge user base in a new way, Simon Peters, an analyst at the online trading platform eToro, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.What Facebook will charge in terms of fees remains unclear, but if it is cheaper and easier to use than traditional payment methods or even certain cryptocurrencies, it could reinvent itself as the go-to place for online payments.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The 128GB version costs $299 and the 256GB one costs $399.The last time the iPod Touch was updated was in 2015, when Apple also added upgraded new components to make sure it could still use its latest software.Since July 2017, when Apple quietly killed off the iPod Nano and Shuffle, the Touch is the only iPod in Apple\u0027s line-up.It seems to have stuck around because it is the only one of the iPods that ever had an internet connection and Apple\u0027s iOS software, allowing it to use services like Apple Music. The company has largely moved away from personal music libraries and songs being stored on computers and iPods, instead encouraging users to sign up for streaming music, as part of a more general move towards services.But old versions of the iPod are still around, and continue to be supported by Apple. They remain one of the problems with the company completely overhauling iTunes and focusing on Apple Music, since the software is still the way that those iPods can be synced with computers and music can be put onto them.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

David Barnett reports\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentJoy Division: (left to right) Ian Curtis, Bernard Sumner, Stephen Morris and Peter HookIt’s a big year for fans of Joy Division and New Order. This summer marks 40 years since the former’s debut album Unknown Pleasures, their only LP released before the suicide of lead singer Ian Curtis, aged 23, in May 1980. The surviving members – bassist Hook, guitarist Bernard “Barney” Sumner and drummer Stephen Morris – transformed themselves into New Order that year, joined by Gillian Gilbert on keyboards, with Sumner taking over vocals. It’s 30 years since the band released Technique. It was their their fifth album, but the one that propelled them to the top of the charts and into proper stardom, influenced by the Balearic sound of house music.Everybody, it seems, has a Joy Division or New Order story to tell, as evidenced by the books released this year. Jon Savage’s This Searing Light, the Sun and Everything Else is an “oral history” of Joy Division, published by Faber in April. Drummer Stephen Morris has his memoirs, Record Play Pause, out this month. Dave Haslam, one-time DJ at Manchester’s Hacienda club, the focal point of the so-called Madchester scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s, mentions his love of both bands in his recent autobiography, Sonic Youth Slept On My Floor.“Hooky”, you might be unsurprised to hear, doesn’t have a lot of truck with any of them. We meet in a Costa in Alderley Edge, a leafy little town in Cheshire, only 20 miles away, geographically, from Salford, where Hooky and Bernard Sumner grew up, but half a world away in other respects.He’s lived here for 20 years, and as we find a quiet corner of the coffee shop, I mention in passing that I took my 14-year-old daughter to listen to Haslam reading from his book a few weeks ago. “Well, when she grows up she’ll never forgive you,” he says.Created with Sketch.Caught on film: Joy Division on tour in 1979 Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hooky perhaps has a reputation for abrasiveness, for speaking his mind, for not taking any crap. He and New Order parted ways in 2007 and don’t appear to be on good terms. I mention that Haslam had spoken fondly of him, which he finds hard to believe. Has he read Haslam’s book?“I haven’t read many good Manchester books,” he says. “I think my favourite is Bez’s. I’ve got Mark E Smith’s on my shelf but not got round to it yet.”Peter Hook to perform Joy Division albums in full at UK showsJoy Division’s Bernard Sumner’s memoir recalls the death of bandmateHooky himself wrote Unknown Pleasures: Inside Joy Division, published in 2012, and he says he did so as a direct response to the author and journalist Mick Middles’ 1996 book, From Joy Division to New Order. “That Middles book was a crock of f**king shit but he inspired me to write my own,” he says. “I suppose I’m in the unenviable position of being too close to the whole thing.”I wave Jon Savage’s book at him and he shakes his head. “That is particularly annoying that one, it’s Joy Division in their own words but a lot of it’s just lifted from when we did the Joy Division documentary. Those interviews were from the Control interview, Faber bought them lock stock and barrel without our permission, without even a f**king charity donation. He had access to the whole transcripts. Didn’t make sense to me, especially from Jon Savage who you’ve known for 40 f**king years. We weren’t party to how it was done in any way shape or form so it’s just another annoyance.”Does a lot of stuff annoy Peter Hook generally? He shrugs. “It’s not that bad after a while. You just get used to it. You get to that bit where nothing surprises you. I mean, I’ve had a few fracas with Jon because he sided with them lot and excluded me which I felt was really unfair, especially when I used to tow his f**king car back so our kid could fix it. So yeah… people have short memories.”There’s a chapter in Dave Haslam’s book where he details being commissioned by NME to interview New Order, a band of which he describes himself as “a devotee, bewitched by them”. Haslam interviewed the band in 1986 at their recording studio in Cheetham Hill afterwards, Hooky gave him a lift back into Manchester city centre. Haslam had taped the interview but something went wrong his tape was blank. In a panic, he sat down in a cafe and tried to write down everything again from memory, commenting:\u0026nbsp“No one knew how I’d crafted the quotes by New Order.”Tales grow in the telling. Legends get embellished. Stories take on a life of their own. “Yeah,” concedes Hooky. In 2010 he wrote a book called The Hacienda: How Not to Run a Club, and says he initially wanted to do it on interviews with the principal characters. “What I found which was really weird, when I started talking to a few people I very quickly realised that everybody had a different memory of the single occasion, so I thought f**k this, I’m going to have to do it on my own. And you find even though you think something is true you can be contradicted by people.”As an example, Hooky cites his auctioning off earlier this year of all his old Joy Division and New Order memorabilia, to raise money for the Epilepsy Society (Ian Curtis suffered from it) and Calm, the charity aimed at tackling suicide, especially among men. He put a bell tree percussion device in the lots, saying it had been used on the Joy Division track Atmosphere. Drummer Stephen Morris, who would have used it, disputed the fact.Hooky says, “I think you’d have to be deaf not to realise that a bell tree made the sound and it wasn’t a tambourine stuck on a pair of scissors. But that is an example of how people can remember completely different things. Normally it doesn’t lead to that level of aggro but it is quite shocking really because there is no truth, the only truth really is your truth. You’re not gonna lie. I’m sure Stephen Morris thinks it was but, y’know, in my opinion he’s wrong, and you have to go with your own truth otherwise you’d never get through life. It is interesting the way you can have completely different ideas.”V97 with Monaco (PA)There’s a sense when talking to Peter Hook that his often cutting remarks about the people he’s shared some of the last 40-odd years with are, in a way, a defensive tactic, that there’s been so many wars of words since New Order split that he’s getting his jabs in first. At one point I ask him what would happen if Bernard Sumner walked into the Costa we were sitting in, and he laughs uproariously and says, “You’d need your camera, mate!”But it’s obvious he loves the music. He’s rarely been without a band or project since he started while New Order were still going he worked with another Factory band, Ad Infinitum. When New Order had their first break-up in 1993, he started two new bands, Revenge and Monaco. New Order reformed for almost a decade from 1998, during which time Hooky began to develop his DJing career, which now sees him about to embark on a tour with Hacienda Classical, kicking off on 8 June at Scarborough’s Open Air Theatre.Classical accompaniment to pop and dance music is something of a thing right now, but this is the fifth year of the Hacienda Classical concept, which combines the live orchestral music of the Manchester Camerata with DJs recreating the sounds of the nightclub’s heyday. If you think that sounds a bit weird, then you wouldn’t be on your own.Camerata Orchestra performing Hacienda Classical (Rex)The idea had been pioneered by DJ Todd Terry in the States, and British DJ Pete Tong had started doing it over here. “Pete Tong was doing it more as a concert, songs finishing and starting. Graeme’s idea was to do it as a DJ mix, just the same as it would be in a club, so once you started you didn’t stop,” says Hooky.That caused some problems with some venues because they wanted an intermission in which to make up the takings on the bar. “But we felt it was more intrinsic to the spirit of the Hacienda to be complete it starts and it finishes, you’re f**ked and you go home and you recover. It was that depth of feeling that you wanted from what we were doing.”The orchestra plays live and the sound is mixed by the DJ in to the classic Hacienda club tracks, with live vocalists. Hooky gets a bit of fire in his eyes that’s impossible to fake just for PR purposes as he waxes lyrical over the gigs. “A lot of these songs you’ve grown up with and they’ve marked many, many special occasions in your life… death, kids, meeting the missus, losing the missus … it’s very charged, it’s very physical, and people f**king love it. And it gives all us old people the excuse to live our youth again, get a babysitter, have the kids tucked up at home, and fearing what you’re going to feel like the next morning.”Hooky started DJing in 2004, doing it full time in 2007 when New Order split for the second time. He says, “I started doing it out of necessity because I had no money at that point, as New Order we’d not worked for a bit. I mainly do dance music and I get in a lot of trouble because everybody expects you to play the f**king Stone Roses and the Happy Mondays ad infinitum.Madchester’ hub\u0026nbsp(Rex)“The other fantastic thing is most DJs are sober and they’re always on time, which is f**king fantastic. If I’m on at 9 o’clock I know the DJ before me will finish at 8.59.59. You play with groups and they’re always f**king late, nobody arguing about who goes on last and all that crap. It’s very courteous. The rivalry comes with you wanting to play a better set.”So he’s looking forward to hitting the road with the Hacienda Classical Tour, which takes in the Royal Albert Hall and the Isle of Wight Festival among its dates. But Hooky has a special soft spot for the tour opener, Scarborough.“Scarborough is a great place,” he enthuses. “I DJ’d in that old place on the pier the last time I was there. They were nuts. And I never realised how beautiful Scarborough was. Scarborough actually reminded me insanely of Palma, Majorca. I couldn’t believe how beautiful it was. All that European money, innit? And they won’t be getting that any more.”Ah, here it is. We look at each other cautiously over our coffee cups. Ageing rock stars and Brexit. You never know how that one’s going to pan out, do you? Morrissey calling the referendum result “magnificent” and Johnny Rotten in a “make America great again” T-shirt.“Look,” says Hooky, who lives in Majorca for half the year and has ambitions to do that full-time. “I’m a traveller. I go all round the world all the time and I do think it’s important in this day and age for us all to stick together, and not to be fragmented. I think that’s the worst thing that could happen to anybody and I think it exacerbates differences and things like immigration and racism.“I just think it’s the wrong way of pursuing a modern life. It’s old-fashioned, and honestly if you found someone who still thought it was a good idea then they’re a f**king idiot because it’s been proved that our government can’t handle it, which is an embarrassment. I was sat there last week doing a Euro news interview and the guy’s going, ‘What’s happening with Brexit?’ and I haven’t a f**king clue but there’s one thing I do know that if I was doing my job as shit as them I’d be stood on me own in a concert hall. There’d be no audience, right, and that’s what makes me laugh about it. Our government is selfish, it’s only interested in power, personal power, personal politics, and the country is just an absolute f**king embarrassment.”He pauses, then shakes his head and adds, “David Cameron should be torn apart by an angry mob. Theresa May had\u0026nbspthe balls to try to stay in office and say I’ll see it out, not like that shithouse.”Though DJing with the Hacienda Classical tour will dominate this summer, Hooky does of course still keep his bass arm working, primarily with Peter Hook and The Light. That started in 2010, around the 30th anniversaryof Ian Curtis’s death, the same year he opened a new nightclub, The Factory, in the old\u0026nbspoffices of Factory Records\u0026nbspin Manchester. The Light performs Joy Division and New Order tracks, as they were meant to be heard, faithfully following the order of the songs on the albums.“I literally only booked one gig, which was at The Factory, and it was supposed to be a one-off celebration and we ended up doing two nights and we started getting loads of interest,” he recalls. “We hadn’t booked anything until we played, it all came out as a result of that and it was wonderful. I’d not played Joy Division songs for 30 years ... to actually start playing them was absolutely fantastic because we hardly ever did them as New Order.”According to Hooky, New Order “buried Joy Division along with Ian”, and they would only very occasionally revisit the old stuff, such as when manager Rob Gretton asked them to play Love Will Tear Us Apart “because it’s f**king so-and-so’s birthday”. He says, “I think we played in our whole career of New Order about three Joy Division songs.”That changed in 2006 when New Order played the first Manchester Versus Cancer gig, an initiative set up by Andy Rourke of The Smiths. They played a full set of Joy Division tunes. “It was absolutely fantastic, it was delightful, absolutely delightful to do,” says Hooky. “But I don’t think Barney liked doing it and I understand that. He wanted to do his own lyrics, he wanted to do his own songs, which makes perfect sense. But it was a frustration, because you’re sort of given something back for a moment and then it’s snatched off you again.But Hooky had developed a taste for performing the Joy Division songs he hadn’t played for 30 years, and The Light was born. In May 2020 The Light will perform the two Joy Division albums, Unknown Pleasures and Closer, in full, at the Manchester Apollo and the Brixton Academy. Again, they will be benefiting the Epilepsy Society and Calm. It will be 40 years, almost to the day, since Ian Curtis died.Without taking anything away from any of the musicians Hooky has worked with (his own son Jack has played with Monaco and The Light), I wonder if it wouldn’t just be simpler – and more satisfying for fans – to get the old band back together again to play these classic songs?We’re just a bunch of old men who are arguing, and we seem happy to keep doing that. But I do feel more and more that... well, life’s just too short, isn’t it?Hooky thinks for a long moment before musing, “With any group you’re always going to get a problem if the members of the group don’t get on. Look at The Smiths the only two that make most money out of it are Morrissey and Marr. It’s a great shame.”I wonder out loud what The Smiths would be like if they were still together as a band today. Hooky looks at me. “Well, what would New Order be like if they were going today?”And could that be a thing?“What happened at the end of New Order was that Bernard and I had completely different ideas about the group, the music, the attitude to business, and they were that far apart,” he says holding his hands wide. “And the only thing in the middle was Stephen. I had the opinion that Steve agreed with me and then found out afterwards that he seemed to agree with Bernard so I’m looking forward to his book for an explanation of that.“Then they reformed behind my back, and licensed the assets to themselves. Which is not exactly the most honourable thing to do but...” He shrugs. “It’s survival.”There was a long-running court case over Hook’s claim of lost royalties after the band’s “restructuring”, which was settled out of court in 2017. Bernard Sumner, Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert continue under the name New Order.Three decades since Technique, 40 years since Unknown Pleasures. Next year will be the 40th anniversary\u0026nbspof Ian Curtis’s death. Is there any change of a reconciliation on the horizon at all? Over the course of the interview, Hooky seems to have mellowed away from his initial defensive-offensive tactic of getting his attacks in first, albeit done with wry humour as they were. Now he seems almost reflective.“You asked me earlier what would happen if Barney walked in here,” he says. “We’re just a bunch of old men who are arguing, and we seem happy to keep doing that. But I do feel more and more that... well, life’s just too short, isn’t it?”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Early hominins in northeast Africa had to learn to walk on two legs to cross these vast areas, according to the study, published in the Journal of Geology.The theory was laid out by a team led by physicist Professor Adrian Melott\u0026nbspin an attempt to join together different strands of research.\u0026nbsp“It is thought there was already some tendency for hominins to walk on two legs, even before this event.

No prizes for guessing where this is…From one mighty ocean to another – ships passing through the Panama canal“After this conversion to savannah, they would much more often have to walk from one tree to another across the grassland, and so they become better at walking upright. They could see over the tops of grass and watch for predators.”Professor Melott arrived at this hypothesis by drawing on research about historic supernovae and evidence for the impact they had on Earth. Ancient seabed deposits of iron-60 isotopes – radioactive forms of iron – provided a crucial clue.‘Neanderthal-like’ teeth reveal early human evolution in EuropeEarly human evolution was ‘multi-ethnic and multicultural’Homo erectus: Early humans were able to speak and crossed sea on boatsProfessor Melott\u0026nbspsaid these materials must\u0026nbsphave arrived on Earth from a supernova, which would have exploded 163 light years away during the transition from the Pliocene Epoch to the Ice Age.“We calculated the ionisation of the atmosphere from cosmic rays which would come from a supernova about as far away as the iron-60 deposits indicate,” he\u0026nbspsaid.“We contend it would increase the ionisation of the lower atmosphere by 50-fold. Usually, you don’t get lower-atmosphere ionisation because cosmic rays don’t penetrate that far, but the more energetic ones from supernovae come right down to the surface – so there would be a lot of electrons being knocked out of the atmosphere.”They suggest ionisation in the lower atmosphere meant there were more pathways for lightning strikes which led to widespread fires.Professor Melott also said he believed his\u0026nbsptheory was supported by the discovery of carbon deposits in soils at around the same time as this cosmic-ray bombardment was happening.\u0026nbsp“The observation is that there’s a lot more charcoal and soot in the world starting a few million years ago. It’s all over the place, and nobody has any explanation for why it would have happened all over the world in different climate zones. This could be an explanation,” he\u0026nbspsaid.\u0026nbsp“That increase in fires is thought to have stimulated the transition from woodland to savannah in a lot of places – where you had forests, now you had mostly open grassland with shrubby things here and there.”Professor Melott said no similar event was expected to happen any time soon. The nearest star capable of exploding into a supernova in the next million years is Betelgeuse, which is 652 light years from Earth.\u0026nbsp“Betelgeuse is too far away to have effects anywhere near this strong,” he\u0026nbspsaid.At the end of last year Professor Melott led another study that found supernovae 2.6 million years ago could have swept Earth’s prehistoric oceans wiping out creatures like the giant shark known as the Megalodon.\u0026nbspHis research suggested that particles from these exploding stars could have caused cancers in large marine mammals to spike.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It could do without Mel B’s rapping, but you can’t have everything.It’s odd that this wasn’t released as a single, because it’s one of the best in the Spice Girls canon: catchy, slickly produced, and with some of the best harmonies the group had to offer. 310 8) \u0027Walk of Life\u0027Did the Spice Girls pull off a reggae track? Kind of (barely), because it’s a lyrical tribute to “straight-talking London town”, which suited the group just fine. The vivacity of these five young women is arguably only more forceful on “Wannabe”. “Spice Up Your Life” was clumsy in its approach as “a song for the world”, with Latin influences and a Bollywood-inspired video, but the energy of the song is what makes it – the result of the five members recording the track in one chaotic afternoon.Despite the rather bizarre safe-sex disclaimer (“Be a little wiser, baby Put it on, put it on”), “2 Become 1” boasts a beautifully textured arrangement and unpolished vocals that capture the group’s unique character. On Spiceworld, “Viva Forever” was a surprisingly moving ballad that reflected on a past love. With the context of Baby Spice (Geri Halliwell) departing from the group with little-to-no warning for fans, many now use it as a fond reflection on what the Spice Girls contributed to pop culture. Those flamenco guitars and heady summer vibes only add to the sense that, however fleeting that time was, certain memories stay with us forever.This disco-infused number should sound more dated than it actually does. “Who Do You Think You Are” is the Spice Girls at the height of their pop powers a slick, infectious and superbly produced jam with that brass punching through.Mel C gets the spotlight on this funk-influenced number, which was written during the same session as “Love Thing” and features an excellent harmonica solo from Judd Lander. It was their second number one single in the UK – released just as the popularity of “Wannabe” was beginning to wane – and also a top five song in the US.The Spice Girls cribbed a number of musical influences for their catalogue, but Motown is one that really shouldn’t have worked. “Stop”, however, is an uplifting song telling a significant other to slow down and just enjoy the ride, bolstered by a fantastic brass section and a jubilant bass line. A war cry that heralded the dawn of the Girl Power movement, and one of the most enduring pop songs of all time. “Wannabe” is the catchiest of all the Spice Girls songs, and through those defiant, half-laughing spoken word moments you understand why so many fans were desperate to be part of the gang. Spice Girls told a generation of young girls that friends are more important than boys. This retro R\u0026ampB track doesn’t boast the same slick production of some of the more popular Spice Girls songs, but that’s part of the appeal. It could do without Mel B’s rapping, but you can’t have everything.It’s odd that this wasn’t released as a single, because it’s one of the best in the Spice Girls canon: catchy, slickly produced, and with some of the best harmonies the group had to offer. 310 8) \u0027Walk of Life\u0027Did the Spice Girls pull off a reggae track?

They appear to be able to execute manoeuvre\u0026nbspthat human pilots would never be expected to pull off: rotating in the air, and accelerating and stopping at possibly fatal speeds.The latest reports are just the latest in a series of mysterious and unexplained reports of UFOs by US pilots. They have become so prevalent – and so little appears to be understood about where they have come from – that the US Navy has changed its reporting procedures in an attempt to learn more about where they are coming from.The pilots involved have said they will not speculate on the origin of the aircraft. We’re here to do a job, with excellence, not make up myths, one told the New York Times, which interviewed five pilots about their previously undiscussed experience.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Apple has announced the new iPod Touch, the first new iPod in four years.

Experts say that any alien explanation is unlikely, though they have not yet been able to rule it out, but it is more likely that it is the result of more mundane effects like bugs in the tracking systems and cognitive overload from such intense flights.US Navy unveils major response to UFO sightingsThe new reports come from pilots who had been flying through 2014 and 2015 over the East Coast of the US.Pilots first became aware of the craft when it showed up on radar tracking systems, they said, and initially thought it was the result of a secret drone programme. But they became more mysterious when they started seeing them in real life.One pilot said that he had almost crashed into one of the objects, which was described as looking like a sphere encasing a cube. Because the pilots were in danger of hitting the objects, they complained that if the craft were part of a secret programme it could be putting their lives at risk.In one of the sightings, which was captured on video, a pilot said he had nearly crashed into an object that was flying at a shocking speed. In the footage, pilots express wonder at the objects\u0027 flight, exclaiming:\u0026nbsp“Wow, what is that? and Look at it fly!”One of the pilots said that the planes appeared able to stay in the sky far longer than any known aircraft would normally be able to.“These things would be out there all day,”\u0026nbspRyan Graves, a pilot who has flown with the Navy for more than 10 years and reported his sightings to the US government,\u0026nbsptold the NYT. “Keeping an aircraft in the air requires a significant amount of energy. With the speeds we observed, 12 hours in the air is 11 hours longer than we’d expect.”And they were flying in ways that could kill a human crew, seeming to accelerate, stop and turn almost instantly.The pilots, who all refused to comment on what the craft could be, said the reports stopped after they moved out of US airspace.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At least 10 Tories have said they will run, including Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt and Matthew Hancock.\u0026nbspBrexit minister James Cleverly is said to be considering a tilt, as well as defence secretary Penny Mordaunt and ex-1922 committee chairman Graham Brady.Theresa May\u0026nbsphas warned her successor against leaving the EU without a deal, after several Conservative leadership candidates said they would be open to the\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbsppolicy.Arriving in Brussels for a meeting with EU leaders, the prime minister said she was not going to comment on the views of inidual candidates.I\u0027ve always take a view that the best option for the UK is to leave the European Union with a deal. I\u0027m not going to comment on the views of inidual candidates.There will be a process of selecting my successor as leader of the Conservative party but I continue to have the view that it\u0027s best for the UK to leave with a deal, she told reporters on the doorstep of the summit.John Bercow name checks Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt for the second time in his Washington speech as those seeking compromise.\u0026nbspClearly both cabinet ministers are on his radar for the leadership.John Bercow says he has \u0027nothing to add to or subtract from\u0027 his comments when he banned US president Donald Trump from addressing the Commons.\u0026nbspHe says \u0027no request had been received\u0027 from the president on this trip but acknowledges\u0026nbspthere was \u0027some correspondence\u0027 about it during his last visit.Asked about Theresa May, John Bercow says he has respect for her and she has always treated him with \u0027the utmost courtesy\u0027.\u0026nbspHe says the\u0026nbspappetite of the Commons to \u0027have its say\u0027 on Brexit \u0027has been whetted\u0027 - and the idea that parliament will be \u0027evacuated from the centre stage on Brexit is simply unimaginable\u0027.John Bercow says there was a disequilibrium in the British body politic a decade ago as the government had too much power.\u0026nbspHe says he has tried to allow the Commons to breathe in his tenure of Speaker.Bercow says it is hard to avoid accusations of bias as Speaker - which is an admirable understatement of the claims thrown against him by Tory Brexiteers.John Bercow is making a speech in Washington, where he has been speaking at length about his role in the Commons.\u0026nbspThe Speaker praises both Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt for their intellectual skill and the way they handle urgent questions in the Commons.\u0026nbspIs that a boost - or a hindrance - for their leadership chances?Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson\u0026nbsphas said the party risked a vortex of shame if it did not root out antisemitism in its ranks.Responding to the EHRC decision to launch a formal investigation (see here), he said: The decision of the Equality and Human Rights Commission to launch a statutory investigation into Labour shows they have reasonable suspicion that the party has unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are JewishI feel utter shame that this investigation is necessary but I truly hope that it will provide the means to finally root out anti-Jewish racism from our party once and for all.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We now request the EHRC to look at all the evidence and investigate this matter with great urgency.”The complaint includes allegations of Islamophobia among MPs, an “atmosphere of hostility” against Muslim Conservatives, failed complaints processes and an overall denial that Islamophobia is a major issue for the party.Miqdaad Versi, of the MCB,\u0026nbspquestioned whether any of the contenders in the Tory leadership race would “prioritise dealing with the sheer scale of Islamophobia that has consumed the Conservative Party”.Tory Party faces 110 allegations of Islamophobia and racismWatchdog gives Tories one month to respond to Islamophobia complaintsGovernment rejects proposed definition of IslamophobiaMr Johnson was criticised over remarks comparing veiled Muslim women to letter boxes and bank robbers, but he was cleared of breaching the Conservative Party\u0027s code of conduct.An independent panel found that the former foreign secretary was respectful and tolerant in the newspaper column.The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), requested more information from the Conservatives on Islamophobia\u0026nbspearlier this month.The watchdog, which enforces equality laws, has the power to take action in court.“We have received complaints regarding the Conservative Party and are considering them in line with our usual processes,” an EHRC spokesperson said.“As part of our standard process, we have written to the Conservative Party to ask for information in order to help assess the complaints.”The call for an Islamophobia probe came as the EHRC announced a formal investigation over antisemitism in Labour on Tuesday.\u0026nbspIt will determine whether the party “has unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish”.The MCB said the timing of its complaint was coincidental and pointed out that it alerted media outlets, including\u0026nbspThe Independent, before the EHRC\u0027s announcement on Labour.Conservatives risk repeating Labour’s mistakes on antisemitismThe government was accused of disregarding the “safety and security of British Muslims” after rejecting a definition of Islamophobia put forward following a parliamentary inquiry.\u0026nbspJames Brokenshire pledged to “arrive swiftly at a collective position” earlier this month, after senior police officers raised concern about the potential impact on counterterror powers.Labour MP Wes Streeting, co-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims said the government has “no more credibility to define Islamophobia than the Labour Party had to redefine antisemitism”.“I have watched, with some amazement and even greater despair, the Conservative Party making exactly the same mistakes over Islamophobia as my party has with antisemitism,” he told the House of Commons.The decision came days before research found that more than 100 people claiming to be Conservative Party members had posted Islamophobic or racist comments online.The MCB has repeatedly called for an independent inquiry into prejudice and the handling of complaints within the party.Dozens of members have been suspended for posting Islamophobic comments on social media, including many directed at leadership contender Sajid Javid.The Conservatives were condemned after reinstating some councillors who had been suspended over racist or prejudiced social media posts.​The government’s commitment to combating anti-Muslim hatred was questioned in the wake of the Christchurch terror attack, when mosques revealed they had been refused security funding.\u0026nbspWhile the government doubled the pot open for bids from different places of worship, it did not bring the funding up to the £14m awarded specifically to Jewish institutions.Muslim worshippers outside a mosque were targeted in the Finsbury Park terror attack and a man who planned to bomb another mosque in south London was jailed in April.Other incidents have seen women wearing headscarves run over in “revenge” for Islamist atrocities, and a man plough a car into an Indian restaurant because he wanted to “kill a Muslim”.Since the Westminster attack in March 2017, 14 Islamist and five far-right terror plots have been foiled in the UK.\u0026nbspLast week, the Home Affairs Committee was told that more than half of rising hate crime offences recorded by police in England and Wales are committed against Muslims.Muslim Council of Britain\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspEquality and Human Rights Commission\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There will be no renegotiation.”On the doorstep of the same meeting Theresa May also warned her potential successors against leaving the EU without a deal.She told journalists she\u0026nbspwas “not going to comment on the views of inidual candidates”, but added: “I continue to have the view that it’s best for the UK to leave with a deal.”The summit, part of the process of\u0026nbspappointing\u0026nbspMr Juncker’s successor, will be one of the last meetings the lame duck prime minister attends in the EU capital, with the final one currently scheduled for June during the Tory leadership contest.Open warfare as Hammond says no-deal Brexit Tories will be toppledRaab warns MPs they won’t stop him forcing through no-deal BrexitA new Commission president is expected to be in post after 31 October, which is also the current Brexit deadline – meaning whoever replaces Ms May will have to deal with Mr Juncker to avoid a no-deal.But none of his possible replacements have massively different views on Brexit, and the direction of policy on the issue is in any case\u0026nbspset by member states.The level of continuity Brexiteers can expect from Brussels is epitomised in the fact that one of the candidates to replace Mr Juncker is in fact Michel Barnier himself, the EU’s chief negotiator.\u0026nbspBrexiteer such as Dominic Raab and Boris Johnson who want to lead the party have said they would be open to leaving without a deal – a course of action expected to bring about economic chaos for the UK.The EU has repeatedly said for months that it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with the UK, and that it is the only deal on the table, though it is open to changes to a separate document – the political declaration for the future relationship – which spells out the future trading arrangements.\u0026nbspBut Ms May has repeatedly failed to get MPs to approve the deal. A fourth attempt to bring the withdrawal agreement\u0026nbspbefore the House of Commons set in motion a chain of events that led to\u0026nbspthe prime minister announcing her resignation on Friday last week.Tuesday European Council meeting, attended by all 28 EU leaders, is one of the first in the EU capital for some time where Brexit has not been discussed in at least some capacity.Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentPro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentThe prime minister appeared in good spirits as she arrived at the meeting, as if a weight had been lifted from her shoulders.

I\u0027ve always argued that it\u0027s perfectly possible that Leave would win again, but we\u0027re supporting a People\u0027s Vote strongly now because it\u0027s the right thing to do and it\u0027s the democratic thing to do.Pressure on the Labour leadership ratcheted up several notches after\u0026nbspthe party lost supporters to the Liberal Democrats and Green Party in the EU elections, leaving Labour with just 14 per cent of the vote.Hours after the results were announced, Ms Abbott tweeted: We have to take the time to analyse the EU vote. But, when we come in third after the Brexit Party, that is a clue something is wrong with our strategy. We need to listen to our members and take a clearer line on a public vote.Created with Sketch.

She said that\u0026nbspsecuring a general election remained the party\u0027s priority but added: As the clock\u0026nbsptickets down, if we\u0027re not going to have a general election, we would support a People\u0027s Vote.Jeremy Corbyn has promised a consultation on Labour\u0027s Brexit\u0026nbsppolicy that could end at the party\u0027s annual conference in September, but his close ally Ms Abbott\u0026nbspinsisted he needed to move quickly. She said she would personally back Remain in any second referendum.As Labour isions on Brexit resurfaced in the aftermath of the elections, MPs\u0026nbspin Leave-supporting areas warned against another referendum.Wigan MP Lisa Nandy said it would most likely result in a no-deal outcome.Labour leadership backs \u0027public vote\u0027 on BrexitConservatives and Labour hit hard in EU election routLabour should promise referendum after \u0027kicking\u0027 say Corbyn alliesLabour must back second referendum or face election loss, Watson warnsShe said:\u0026nbspObviously in constituencies like Wigan you get very mixed views, you get different views like everywhere in the country, but to most people the idea of a second referendum just seems quite absurd.People were asked what they think, you can see from the results that we had here, that very few people have changed their minds and if there is a shift in this area of the country I think it\u0027s towards no-deal Brexit.She added: I think we\u0027ve got to wake up to the seriousness not just of what we\u0027re about to do to the Labour Party, but what we\u0027re about to do the country because I strongly suspect that if there is a second referendum people here would come out and vote in fairly large numbers and probably vote for no deal.She went on: There is a huge frustration amongst Labour voters who voted Leave in towns like mine to see leading figures from the Labour Party out calling for a second referendum before there\u0027s been any serious attempt to implement the result of the first.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Instead, it charged a yearly fee of 99 cents in order to generate revenue and cover the costs of hosting the chats of millions of users.WhatsApp experienced huge growth following the Facebook takeover\u0026nbspand now boasts more than 1.5 billion users from around 180 countries, however it has since softened its stance on adverts.WhatsApp co-founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton\u0026nbsphave both left the messaging app in recent years and have been critical of Facebook\u0027s attempts to monetise the app.In 2012, two years before the Facebook takeover, Mr Koum explained WhatsApp\u0027s stance towards advertising by quoting the movie\u0026nbspFight Club.Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can by shit we don\u0027t need, he wrote in a blog post.

It would carry around 700MW at high-voltage direct current, and run under the sea.Energy regulators in the two countries approved the project at the beginning of May this year, and it has now received the political go-ahead.Ireland votes overwhelmingly to liberalise orce lawsDeal or no deal?

No explanation for the ban has been given.The blocking of the app is just the latest in a series of moves by authorities that have raised concerns among the LGBT+ community in Lebanon – once seen as a beacon of liberalism in a religiously conservative region. \u0026nbsp“This is not an independent incident, this is part of a bigger campaign and strategy to limit the spaces of the LGBT community,” said Georges Azzi, executive director of the Arab Foundation For Freedoms and Equality.“The groups behind this campaign operate in an atmosphere where the government and security apparatuses are encouraging attacks on freedom of expression.

But despite some gains in recent years, the community still faces widespread discrimination.Activists responded positively to a ruling issued by a district court last year which overturned a law that had been used to persecute the LGBT+\u0026nbspcommunity in Lebanon. Article 534 of Lebanon’s penal code, which was introduced in the early 20th century under the French mandate, punishes “any sexual intercourse contrary to the order of nature”. Judges ruled that the law could not be applied to consensual sex between adults of the same sex.anti-LGBT+ countries in Europe, according to ILGA-EuropeBut in February this year, Human Rights Watch filed a complaint with the United Nations over claims that Lebanon’s security services “repeatedly interfered with human rights events related to gender and sexuality”.The complaint came in response to an attempt by police to shut down a regional conference on the rights of LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople being held in Lebanon.Digital forms of communication like\u0026nbspGrindr\u0026nbspbreak the isolation that members of the community feel as many still live with family\u0026nbsp“There were some positive steps and Lebanon has been the space for activism in the region, but this space and freedom is being taken away from us,” Mr Azzi said.The lack of public space for LGBT+ people in Lebanon was one of the reasons the Grindr app was so important, according to Tarek Zeidan, executive director of Helem, one of the oldest LGBT+ rights groups in the region.“Lebanon is a place that is sorely lacking in non-commercial public places where members of the community can freely and openly meet. Digital forms of communication like Grindr break the isolation that members of the community feel as many still live with family,” he told The Independent.“Grindr has also become an effective way to disseminate life-saving information on sexual health and safety\u0026nbsp– this move will set these efforts back significantly, especially when it comes to contacting difficult-to-reach populations such as iniduals living in rural areas, closeted or discreet iniduals, and refugees which constitute a sizeable portion of the community,” he added.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is just the beginning.In a warning to the Westminster parties, he said: If we dont leave on October  then the scores you have seen for the Brexit Party today will be repeated in a general election, and we are getting ready for it.Mr Farage repeated his demand for the Brexit Party to be involved in the negotiations ahead of the Halloween deadline.All EU citizens, as long as they are registered to vote, have the right to vote in the European elections.The UK uses the D’Hondt system of proportional representation which means the number of MEPs a party wins is directly related to the percentage of votes it receives.Voters choose a single party instead of an inidual candidate.This means all political parties have the chance to send representatives to the European Parliament.The proportion of seats given by a party directly reflects the proportion of votes won.In the first round of counting, the party with the most votes is allocated a seat for the candidate at the top of its list.Under the D’Hondt method, each party’s total number of votes is repeatedly ided – until all seats are filled – by isor  + the number of seats already allocated.If it is still top it gains another seat. If not, whichever party has the most votes then gets the seat instead.The original vote count of the largest party in each round is ided by one plus the total number of seats they have already been allocated, until all the seats for the region have been handed out.Although the method is considered to be one of the most constant and representative forms of voting, the results do not exactly reflect the votes, as this would lead to parties winning fractions of seats.EU voters go to the polls every five years to elect Members of the European Parliament .Each country has a specic number of seats based on their population size.The smallest is Malta and they have six seats, whereas the largest is Germany with .There are  MEPs in total and the UK has .Candidates can stand independently or with a party.They will represent a region of their country, and the number of MEPs for each region depends on population.The government confirmed the country would be taking part in the EU elections in early May after May administration was forced to push back the date it was leaving the bloc because MPs could not get a majority for her withdrawal agreement.As the UK was still in the EU at the time of the elections it is forced to take part even though the majority of voters said they wanted to leave in the referendum vote.The UK went to the polls to elect MEPs on May , .The vote is said to have cost around £million to hold.If a Brexit deal is agreed before the election date or soon after then the UK’s MEPS will not take their seats.Butthat doesn’t happen then the newly elected MEPs will take their place in the European Parliament – which sits in Brussels and Strasbourg - in early July.European Council President Donald Tusk has said that MEPs could sit for “months or even longer”the negotiations drag on.At this stage, how long the UK MEPs will continue to sit is anyones guess.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It will be ungenerous not to remember too her unshakeable dedication to her country and remarkable perseverance against what became insurmountable odds.She is a good person. She did her best.But she is a poor Prime Minister and the author of her own downfall. She appointed a Cabinet of loyal friends largely devoid of talent.She credulously swallowed bad advice from a staunchly europhile and dysal civil service.She lacked vital traits for a leader: core beliefs, confidence, decisiveness, mental agility, communication skills and a willingness to trust and delegate.These failings, and a suicidal manesto, were exposed at the  election. Stripped of her majority, she foolishly tried to pretend “nothing has changed” and made promises she couldn’t keep.She negotiated a Brexit deal which was bad enough even before Monday’s final, fatal compromises.Mrs May described what she sees as her legacy. It is thin gruel. The economy is doing fine, the job market booming. But she did next to nothing for Sun readers, for the “just about managings”.Brexit is undone, like her “social justice” agenda. Our democracy is in disarray, Britain ided, her party at historic poll lows. She leaves her successor an even more colossal task than her own.Whoever that is must, above all, stop Corbyn’s thuggish extremists winning power.That can only be done by delivering Brexit — yes, with No Dealneed be — and somehow seeing off the Brexit Party whose surge could let Corbyn in.Winning the battle of ideas against the Marxist Left will be far simpler. Who is best placed to do it It must be a Brexiteer ready to appoint a younger, fresher, far more talented top team. There are plenty of able Tories in the ranks, their paths blocked by ­Cabinet duds who must be swept away.Leave-backing MPs must avoid splitting their vote and letting another Remainer into No. The party may not survive it.Nor, we believe, will its members tolerate any attempt by MPs to block their favourite candidates. They now have Nigel Farage’s party to join.Mrs May has left the Tories in dire straits and with one chance to survive.For their sake — and Britain’s — they had better make the right choice.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Andyou are paid less than someone  because they are better than you then that is OK. But that is apparently not the case here.“Despite being awarded the same job, on the same day, after the same board, during the same recruitment process, BBC News asked me to accept a considerably lower salary than my male counterpart. A lot less,” Karen told colleagues by email.“I’ve been assured our roles and responsibilities are the same. I’ve also been told my appointment was ‘very well deserved’. It’s just that I’m worth £, less.“Over the past four months I have asked BBC News to think again. And they’ve inched their offer up . . . now the gap is nearer to £,. But for me it has never been about the actual salary. It has been about equal pay.”She also said she had turned down the job on principle after discussing the matter with her young daughters, which led her to conclude that she must “stand up for what is right”.And, to my mind, that is the real nub of this story.Her two daughters, aged seven and , said this to her: “You always tell us to stand up for what is right. If it means less pocket money or not going on holiday, we don’t mind.What matters to us is that when we grow up, we want to be paid the same as a man for the same job.”How poignant — and how powerful. Sometimes you have to see things through the eyes of children to realise there is only one course of action.It makes me think of that phrase: Strong women — may we know them, may we be them, and may we raise them.Well, Karen is certainly raising them. And her brave decision means that her children won’t be as subservient as the women of our generation.To an extent, women have always just accepted the status quo when it comes to men being paid more. But that’s changingStill, what Karen did by refusing the job and sending that email is brave. Most people don’t like to rock the boat, which sometimes means we accept things that should be unacceptable.And women, especially mothers, are often so grateful to have a job that they don’t question it. That’s especially the case for single working mums, as Karen is.Most single working mums simply can’t afford not to work, so they put up and shut up. But that expectation that women should accept less than they are worth makes my blood boil.Can you imagine, by the way,it had emerged that men were routinely being paid less than women  Would we ever hear the end of it Not until equality came. So maybe we all need to think like men for a bit.By rocking the boat, Karen is taking one for the team. She will be no doubt be seen as a troublemaker by some potential employers. But it’s not until people make stands like this that change happens.Despite the furore, the gender pay gap is still everywhere, and it’s not until people say, “No more” that things will change. The bottom line is that women need to start feeling a bit more entitled.We need to know our worth and not be afraid to ask for it. Because the sad truth is that people will pay you less than you are worththey can get away with it. So let’s not be muggins enough to accept it, eh HAVE you been following the story of chef Gary Usher, who was asked by a homeless man called Derickhe had any jobs in his restaurant He offered Derick a job as a kitchen porter. And then tweeted about it because he was happy to have done a good deed.His tweet then went viral. And then suddenly people started accusing him of exploiting homeless people to publicise his restaurant.But given the fact that Usher has declined every single one of the many invitations he has had to go on TV to talk about this story that is so patently untrue.And also, regardless of whether he publicised it or not, there is no doubt that he did a good thing.Still, he has been roundly vilied for what was evidently a kind-hearted gesture.Social media has made us into a nation of cynics and critics. The saying “no good deed goes unpunished” seems very true on this occasion.LOTS of teenagers will no doubt be envious to hear about Benjy Fish, the -year-old from Middlesex who has dropped out of school after being encouraged by his mother – to become a professional gamer.Benjy, who has so far earned £, playing Fortnite, is ranked among the best in the world.And he has guaranteed himself another £, by qualying for this year’s Fortnite World Cup, which boasts a prize pool of £million.He’ll be competing at the event in New York this July, which may sound like the dream for some, and I wish him all the best.But has any parent ever uttered the words: “I hope my son quits school at  to become a professional gamer”  I seriously doubt it.NO doubt the critics will line up to bemoan the fact that Davina McCall is dating again after her orce from Matthew Robertson.She is seeing her long-term friend and hairdresser, Michael Douglas, who she has known for more than  years.All I can think about is just how daunting it must be to put yourself “out there” and start dating again after  years of marriage and three kids.Add to that the burden of being famous, which makes it hard to join Tinder .But we should all wish Davina well – good for her for giving herself another chance at happiness and finding love again. She turned  in October and has got a whole new chapter of her le to live. Why should that be alone Divorcees out there should take heart. You are entitled to happiness. You might just want to go and have a bit of fun by putting yourself out there without waiting for Mr Perfect.Or the love of your le might already be under your nose, like Davina’s hairdresser.What could be better than getting together with an old friend, because he knows the real her. But also, possibly best of all, no more bad hair days.I HAVE no idea what is being shown at the Cannes Film Festival­ – these days it’s much more about the red-carpet dresses than the actual movies.And wow, were there some dresses this year.Alessandra Ambrosio, , and Sharon Stone, , dazzled in little red numbers.The most amazing thing is that there is  years between them. What is Sharon Stone’s secret  She never ages.SO sad reading about Jasmine Bush, the -year old schoolgirl who threw herself in front of a train on the day she was due to receive the grades for her GCSEs in .She had been suffering with ious mental health issues, including anxiety, and had been on medication to help control the symptoms.But she had also been smoking marijuana to relieve anxiety symptoms. Except it clearly had the opposite effect. This story is every parent’s nightmare.Smoking weed is seen as innocent and has been normalised by the fact that “everyone does it”. But it is illegal for a reason.Marijuana is known to make people paranoid and, far from curing anxiety, it exacerbates it.

Since March , the day the UK should have left the EU, there has been a growing sense of political crisis.Brexit wasn’t happening and the government’s impressive achievements were being lost in the fog. If government was telling people about the growing economy, unemployment falling to its lowest since  or the UK attracting more inward investment in the last year than any other country in the world – no-one was listening.Theresa May was rightly committed to building a majority in parliament for something that would at least complete the first stage of Brexit and allow a new leader to negotiate the future relationship without constant battles in parliament getting in the way.But when she started offering concessions to Jeremy Corbyn’s far left outfitt, the mood in the Tory party darkened.As Chairman of the Parliamentary Conservative Party - the “ Committee” - I had to balance two very strong demands from my colleagues.Firstly, with the failure to exit the EU and the loss of so many brilliant councillors in local elections at the beginning of May, a majority of Conservative MPs had decided that a change of leader was essential.Secondly, most of my colleagues also took the view that Theresa should be allowed the space to leave the stage with dignity.However disappointed or angry people are that we are stuck in a logjam, they know that Mrs May has given it her all. Her dogged determination and absolute commitment to the service of our country have been obvious to everyone.It was sad and painful to be there at the moment that she said she would resign as leader of the party and no one could fail to be moved by her parting words outside No. The ConservativeParty knew that change was needed but I am glad that the process has begun with decency and respect.Some people inside and outside parliament have talked about me being a candidate for leader. As Chairman of the  Committee I would have been in charge of the election process so I stood down with immediate effect so that everything can be seen to be above board.I can now consider my position unconstrained. Whoever stands – and whoever wins, the task is a big one. It is nothing less than restoring the broken trust in British politics.We have to leave the EU as we promised we would and then get back to a radical agenda to let people take back control of their lives. Politicians need to talk less about social mobility and do more to make sure that everyone in our great country can make the most of their talents.The crucial starting point must be to reunite the Conservative Party: faced with the most extreme socialist threat that would destroy business, jobs and savings we owe it not to ourselves but to every decent hardworking citizen.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On Sunday it took several minutes to establish whether or not one of them, Wheeler Dealer, could impersonate an animal.When it does get going the show can very occasionally feel like arriving two hours late at the pub. Everyone’s laughing but you’ve no idea why.For the most part, though, The Ranganation belongs to the same comedy applause school as The Last Leg, Mash Report and New World Order.They’ll clap anything here, in fact. Romesh’s mum admits taking a curry to the cinema . Nigel Farage gets covered in milkshake . The Dogfather telling us to: “Stop raping the planet,” .Although, I say anything, the moment it broke down was when half a dozen people applauded the idea of Boris Johnson becoming Prime Minister and, woah!, Romesh had to threaten them, jokingly, with ejection.They’d broken the rules, you see. Shows like The Ranganation like to think of themselves as edgy, but they’re very tightly governed by the laws of political correctness.This means you no longer have to be funny to be a stand-up or comedy host, but you must be on-message, which is why, paradoxically, we’ve never had more comedians on telly but so few actual laughs.Flogging them to death doesn’t work either. You may have found Katherine Ryan and Romesh funny the first time you saw them, but you’re probably fed up with the sight of them by their thousandth appearance.As for the actual process of this show The Ranganation wasn’t sure dating apps worked and milkshake throwing was also a grey area, but the host definitely thought we could save the planet by not flushing our toilets.“So do you mindI come round your house and p*** like a horse ”It’d be appreciated, ta.Good Morning Britain, Piers Morgan: “I am not morbidly obese.”Good Morning Britain, Kevin Maguire: “There are quite a few Leave voters at the BBC.”And Good Morning Britain, Susanna Reid: “Honestly,Andi Peters was in  Hunks, which he should be, he’d be scoring .” Out of what, Susanna OVER on BBC’s look-into-the-future drama Years And Years, all-out nuclear war between China and America seems to have fizzled out after one episode.The good news, though, is it seems to have released enough radiation poisoning to kill off Jessica Hynes’s character, Edith, the campaigner, activist and all-round pain-in-the-ar*e, within the next couple of episodes.If you think that’ll be the end of the political lecture, however, you couldn’t be more wrong.Writer Russell T Davies is far too hot under the collar about America, Israel, “the West”, bankers, privatisation and “NHS cuts” to get off his high horse any time soon.Weirdly, he also wants Years And Years viewers to try and believe that, in the not-too-distant future, a Christian regime, in the Ukraine, will be torturing gay people.Which, given that homosexuality is currently and exclusively a death penalty offence in ten Islamic states, has to be one of the most cowardly distortions of reality I’ve ever seen on a television drama.Far less sinister, but almost as tiresome, is the continued presence of Alexander Armstrong on Years And Years.He turned up hosting a  edition of Have I Got News For You in the first episode, and then reappeared fronting Pointless Celebrities, in the year , last week.So don’t expect any sympathyhe reappears tonight on Best Ever Christmas , still murdering Fields Of bloody Gold.You’ve been given your four-minute warning.Michael Owen: “It was great opportunityism from the striker.”And Neil Lennon: “It’s a once-in-a-letime opportunity that’s come round again.”Victoria Coren Mitchell’s nauseating love-in with MP Jess Phillips on Have I Got News For You.Piers Morgan telling Le Stories guest Mel B The Spice Girls were “the female Beatles”, when they weren’t even the female Tremeloes.Hollyoaks actor Maxim Baldry attempting a Ukrainian accent in Years And Years.Every bone-idle chancer in Britain interpreting “Bank Holiday Monday” as “Take Friday off as well”.And Britain’s Got Talent auditions getting lost in sob stories, sentimentality and all those magical charisma voids who begin by announcing: “I need someone to come up and help me.” BZZZZZ, “Next ”B “Form a conga with Seumas Milne and start celebrating.”C “We don’t know.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In  Serbian Branislav Ivanovic joined which London-based football team ”I’d have had these people housed in the sort of lodges we give away on this programme.”But you weren’t, so stop playing the hero and just link to your rip-off phone-line competition. Picture research by Alfie Snelling.NEVER a good sign, is it, when you vomit up your own decomposed internal organs, have to be buried in a zinc coffin and a cement mixer turns up to your funeral That’s the thing about Sky Atlantic’s Chernobyl, though, it spares you no details about the greatest technological catastrophe of the th century. Nor should it.Because, shamefully, I hadn’t realised just how close the  disaster came to destroying the entire planet.As well as flagging up my own appalling ignorance, this must also be some sort of tribute to the power of a production where they’ve got everything right, from the Soviet-era clothingto the script and performances of all the main leads, Jared Harris, Jessie Buckley, Emily Watson and even the bloke in the Mikhail Gorbachev skull cap.It loses absolutely nothing, either, from the fact that Finchy from The Office appears to have been in the Politburo, and that the heroic leader of the Russian miners, who tunnelled underneath the damaged reactor, was Trevor off EastEnders.Well, OK, maybe it takes a bit of the edge off, but still, Chernobyl is not just the best thing on TV, it’s the only thing right now.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As Daniel Hannan, one of the Party’s surviving MEPs, put it: “People voted to leave three years ago and we haven’t left, it’s as simple as that.”Many voters were already deeply unhappy about the way the PM kept watering down and abandoning her negotiating red lines. Ditching the Brexit deadline was the last straw and pushed them over the edge. Step one of recovery is clear: Brexit must happen.If there’s a glimmer of hope it’s that May has agreed to resign. Imagineshe was still barricaded in Downing Street — more time would be wasted on the struggle to prise her out of the building.Instead, the race to succeed her has begun. No more politely pretending that “there’s no vacancy”. Instead, the MPs who hope to be the next Prime Minister can openly set out their stalls.There is no time to waste. This has got to be a proper contest, to produce a leader whose abilities and ideas have been thoroughly tested. The stakes are as high.Tory members, disillusioned, frustrated and bruised, want totheir party to winning ways. Democrats want the Leave vote to be honoured.And everyone wants to hear the proposals put forward by those who want to govern.The only option is to get this right and keep that essential promise. The future of the Conservative Party rests on it, but far more importantly so does the future of our country. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Tories were expecting to be punished for having failed to deliver Brexit.In contrast, Labour seemed set for a comfortable,modest second place.Instead they found themselves overtaken by the Liberal Democrats, who can now claim to be the most popular party among Remain voters.Labour now seems set for a row about a second referendum that could every bit as intense as the Tory leadership battle.Could Farage make a similar impact in a general election No. That said, his party is standing as high as % in polls of Westminster vote intentions. Past experience suggests that such rises often disappear within weeks.However, Brexit is not going to disappear from the political agenda any time soon.If the Brexit Party support continues to run at anything like %, the Conservatives are likely to struggle to regain a lead in the polls.How do these results play into Tory  Labour leadership battles The Tory contenders will have to convince MPs they can win back the votes lost to the Brexit Party – and that, in turn, will ensure a lively debate about whether the government should embrace leaving without a deal.Jeremy Corbyn, meanwhile, seems set to face severe pressure from within his party to sht in favour of a more avowedly pro-second referendum, pro-Remain stance.It is a step he has repeatedly seemed reluctant to take – but maybe this time his party will overrule him What do the results tell us about support for Brexit Many voters lined up behind Remain and Leave parties.But some voted out of traditional loyalty or on the basis of other issues, such as the environment.And many voters were willing to leave behind their traditional party loyalties in order to express their view on Brexit.The results reveal a country polarized between leaving without a deal and wanting a second referendum, though neither options is necessarily backed by a majority.So, no mandate for no deal No. Only % of voters supported a party that was willing to contemplate leaving without a deal. That is well short of a majority.Is a general election this year now more or less likely A general election isn’t going to be attractive to the new Tory PM.They would be worried that those who voted for the Brexit Party would be reluctant to switch back to Tory until Brexit is delivered.That said,the new Prime Minister decides the pressure from the Brexit Party means the UK should crash out without a deal at the end of October, they could well find themselves facing a confidence vote in which some Conservative MPs fail to back the government.That could lead to an unwanted general election.Do we now know how a second referendum would go No better than we did already. The opinion polls do give us a clue.They have long suggested that Remain enjoys a consistent but narrow lead – currently, Remain , Leave .However, much of this lead rests on the views expressed by those who did not vote three years ago – and who perhaps cannot be relied upon to vote a second time around.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

LOOK! a button battery! That is so dangerous!’Looking around I saw an opened packet on the shelf that obviously a shopper had left there - did they not understand how incredibly dangerous these items are I decided that we needed to show what damage these batteries can do, so I put some chicken fillets in my trolley and my daughters and I did the time-lapse photos that afternoon.”To carry out the experiment, Sarah - a paediatric nurse - placed a battery inside a chicken fillet for a total of four hours and monitored the level of damage done during that period.The first image was taken after  minutes showing some noticeable black marks, while the third image was taken after four hours with clear burning to the chicken.It represents the similar damage that could be caused to your little ones stomachthey swallowed one.For more information and advice visit the Child Accident Prevention Trustwebsite.Sarah said: “Even though I have seen first hand the damage that a button battery can do, I was still shocked at the immediacy of the burns.According to The Battery Controlled campaign, when a coin-sized lithium button battery gets stuck in a child’s throat, the saliva triggers an electrical current.This then causes a chemical reaction that can severely burn the oesophagus in as little as two hours.If this has happened to your child, they will likely start coughing, drooling or complain about discomfort.Sarah hopes that her experiment will help parents visualise the dangers button batteries present.She said: “In my career as a paediatric emergency nurse I have cared for children who had swallowed or choked on button batteries.“A few were lucky because it was witnessed by a parent and they knew to seek immediate emergency help, however, most ended up with horric injuries, sometimes requiring years of ongoing treatmentthey survived.”She added that prevention is the best cure and urged parents to have a scout around the home to get rid of any button batteries that might be lurking around."},{"url":null,"title":"us navy pilots spot ufos","story":"The daily sightings came over the course of  and  and were reported to the Pentagon and Congress.Lieutenant Ryan Graves said he saw “strange objects” with “no visible engine or infared exhaust plumes” reaching at least , feet and flying at hypersonic speeds almost daily while training off the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt.Graves, an F A- Super Hornet pilot who has been with the Navy for  years, told The New York Times: “These things would be out there all day.“Keeping an aircraft in the air requires a signicant amount of energy.“With the speeds we observed,  hours in the air is  hours longer than we’d expect.”The unidentied flying objects were seen performing manoeuvres that were “beyond the physical limits of a human crew,” like stopping rapidly, turning instantly or immediately accelerating at hypersonic speeds, the pilots said.The sightings were reported to the Pentagon’s shadowy Advanced Aerospace Threat Identication Program, which confirmed earlier this month they still investigate claimed sightings of alien spacecraft.In late , a Super Hornet pilot said he almost hit one of the objects — which he said looked like a sphere encasing a cube — and an official mishap report was filed.Another pilot, Lt.

It’s rotating,” one of them said.“Wow, what is that, man ” another exclaims. “Look at it fly!”At first the pilots interviewed in the report thought the objects were part of a top-secret drone program.But after the near-collision they reason that government officials knew there were fighter pilots in the area and would not send drones to get in the way.Navy spokesman Joseph Gradisher said it’s unclear what caused the sightings detailed in the article.The Times report comes after the Navy in April sent out a new classied guidance for how to report the “unexplained aerial phenomena.”A number of reports ensued but some cases could have been commercial drones, Gradisher said.But, in other cases: “We don’t know who’s doing this, we don’t have enough data to track this. So the intent of the message to the fleet is to provide updated guidance on reporting procedures for suspected intrusions into our airspace.”Neither Graves nor the other pilots or the Department of Defence would speculate on what the objects were.“We’re here to do a job, with excellence, not make up myths,” one pilot said. The Department of Defence went as far to reveal they will continue to probe such reports in a bid to keep the nation safe.A spokesperson for the the Department of Defence was forced to admit that reports, claiming their investigations were stopped in , were not true.OFFICIAL STATEMENTSpeaking to the NY Post, Christopher Sherwood said in a statement: The Department of Defence is always concerned about maintaining positive identication of all aircraft in our operating environment, as well as identying any foreign capability that may be a threat to the homeland.“The department will continue to investigate, through normal procedures, reports of unidentied aircraft encountered by US military aviators in order to ensure defense of the homeland and protection against strategic surprise by our nation’s adversaries.”WHAT IS THE ADVANCED AEROSPACE THREAT IDENTIFICATION PROGRAM The investigations are part of the US governments, Advanced Aerospace Threat Identication Programme .The program began in  and was run by military intelligence official, Luis Elizondo.The existence of the AATIP was revealed in , along with a -second DOD video that shows an airborne object being chased by two Navy jets off the coast of San Diego in .Defence experts across the world have been left shell shocked by this bombshell revelation.Nick Pope who launched secret probes into UFOs for the UK during the s said this new admission makes it clear that they really did study what the public would call UFOs.UFOs have been repeatedly investigated by the American military, including a study code-named Project Blue Book which started in .A version of this story originally appeared on the NY Post."},{"url":null,"title":"remainer flybe remove brexit beanie","story":"IT consultant Derek Knowles claimed he was told he wouldnt be allowed to sit on the flight from Knock, Ireland to Manchester due to the bright yellow hats offensive message.It comes after the Brexit Party had a sweeping victory in the EU Parliament elections this weekend - leaving the Tories and Labour in its wake.And leader Nigel Farage was forced to fire back over claims that pro-Remain parties received a larger percentage of votes in the recent elections.Derek said his own beanie was the latest casualty in the Brexit chaos - asked to take it off after a fellow passenger on the BE flight had taken offence.Speaking to The New European, he said:just took exception to it.She was polite but firm, saying it might be offensive to other people and Im not allowed to wear it on the plane.Derek said he had sat down on the flight while wearing the hat, but removed it when asked by the pilot.He said: I didnt want to delay the flight or get thrown off.

It is not a fact.Add up the Brexit vote, add up the Ukip vote, add the Conservative vote, who are still a party that says we are going to leave, and you will find that Leave beat Remain.In fact what you will find is that overall the country is - in favour of leaving.We are supposed to be a democracy.

At least  MPs have already chucked their hats in the ring to replace her in a contest dominated by Brexit. By the end of July we could have a hard Brexiteer Prime Minister who wants to crash the UK out with no deal. Or it could be a more moderate candidate, a continuity May option of entering yet more negotiations with the EU. So who is bidding to replace Theresa May  Hereaposs a full rundown of the candidates with profiles, odds and how much of a True Blue Tory Warrior™ they are. Or click here to see where they all stand on Brexit.  Unlike Mrs Mayaposs election in , where Tory members never voted, this race promises to be the most bruising in years. And just like her election, it will have profound consequences for Brexit - with a hard-right, Hard Leaver likely to take the reins. Under the rules of a Tory leadership race, candidates bidding for the crown must be nominated by two or more fellow Tory MPs. A series of knockout ballots is then held among MPs to whittle down the wide field of candidates to just two.  Those two preferred candidates go to a run-off of the wider Conservative Party, with its , members eligible to vote. The candidate who wins the most votes becomes the leader.

The Old Etonian was one of the key players in the  Leave campaign after a last-minute decision to back Brexit. He resigned from the Cabinet in  in protest at Mayaposs plan. He was tipped as a successor to David Cameron but ruled himself out after Michael Gove stabbed him in the back with a last-minute bid for the top job. Since then heaposs lost weight and had a haircut in what many argued was a pre-leadership bid upgrade. Sure enough he confirmed by telling a business conference: Iaposm going to go for it! Selecting the former mayor of London for eight years would enrage Tory Remainers, who believe he is in this game only for himself and his ego. He became notorious for his attention-grabbing offensive comments, when he called black people piccaninnies, said Barack Obama was part-Kenyan and compared the EU to Adolf Hitler. Heaposs also criticised for vast sums of money he rakes in alongside being an MP for speeches and a £,-a-yearcolumn - which was rapped for inaccuracy by the press regulator. Meanwhile, heaposs been rapped for showing a lack of respect to Parliament by repeatedly breaking Commons rules. Supporters say that since splitting with his long-suffering we Marina Wheeler and shacking up with ex-Tory head of press Carrie Symonds, heaposs mended his ways and become more serious. But scores of Tory MPs would vote for Anyone But Boris and a Scottish operation to stop him was nicknamed Operation Arse. Dominic Raab VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING: .   During his four-month stint as Brexit Secretary, ultra-hard Leaver Dominic Raab suggested he would use leaving the EU to slash business taxes. Now heaposs running for leader heaposs hinted p could be slashed off income tax - cutting billions from the public purse. And that wasnapost all that would anger left-wingers. The -year-old sparked fury in  by saying most food bank users are not languishing in poverty. He claimed: The typical user... is someone who has a cash flow problem. When a disability activist told him people are dying under Tory austerity, he described her calls for cash as a childish wish list. And he put out a pamphlet in  that suggested exempting small firms from minimum wage laws for workers under . Mr Raab positioned himself early on for the leadership, setting out his plans to tackle kne crime with “robust policing” and community work. He also paraded in his home in a cringeworthy interview with his we. And he attempted to outflank hostile competition by addressing claims he used a gagging order, to silence a former colleague who accused him of bullying. Mr Raab told The Sunday Times the claims, which date back to  before he was an MP, were completely ”. Michael Gove VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    The Environment Secretary had a bruising experience in the last Tory leadership race stabbing Boris in the back before finishing third. And he kept his powder dry in the days immediately following Theresa Mayaposs announcement she would quit. But behind the scenes his allies, including Treasury minister Mel Stride, have been approaching MPs in the most unlikely positions to seethey will join his slate. One former Cabinet minister told the Mirror Mr Gove was one of the most likely to be elected. Despite infuriating teachers when he was Education Secretary, and stabbing Boris Johnson in the back for leadership in , the -year-old is seen as a competent media performer and has won plaudits as a campaigner for environmental issues. He has already paraded with his Scottish parents as part of the proxy leadership contest in the party. He was a prominent face in the Brexit campaign, but he isnapost wildly trusted by other figures on the Conservativesapos eurosceptic wing.    Jeremy Hunt VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was a prominent Remainer in the  referendum. And despite a sht towards Eurosceptic views heaposs now even more prominent - warning deliberately causing No Deal would be political suicide and put Corbyn in No. Mr Hunt has marked himself out as the more moderate candidate against hard Brexiteers but could risk being seen as the continuity candidate for Theresa May. As Health Secretary, Mr Hunt, , fought a long battle with the medical profession over a new contract for doctorsapos working conditions. The -year-old became Foreign Secretary in July following the resignation of Boris Johnson. He chose not to run in the  leadership contest and instead gave his full support to Mrs May, saying it was not the right time to put his hat in the ring.    Andrea Leadsom VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    The -year-old, grammar-school educated former bank executive is about as true blue Tory as you can get. She survived to the final two of the  Tory leadership race, pitching herself as the Hard Brexit, blue alternative to Theresa May with a cringeworthy march in Westminster. But she infamously pulled out after making controversial remarks about motherhood and trying to deny them. She was loyal in public for two years of Cabinet office while furiously working to push towards a harder Brexit in private, through the pizza club of Tory ministers. She played a crucial part in forcing Theresa Mayaposs resignation announcement, resigning from the PMaposs cabinet and blasting her plan hours before the EU elections.    Rory Stewart VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    The Hong Kong-born son of a diplomat, an Old Etonian, once admitted his career gives the appearance he was a spy. The -year-old delivered his own child after a career as a diplomat in the Foreign Office. He was elected MP for Penrith and the Border in  and joined the government in . The International Development Secretary wasted no time after being promoted to the Cabinet in May . He announced his pitch to be PM within hours. He has since travelled to Leave-voting areas such as Barking to put himself out in the faces of the public. Yet his approach - blindly following the PMaposs Brexit deal and saying it might even be worth splitting the party for - has made him wildly unpopular among Tory Brexiteers.    Sajid Javid  VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:       It’s widely expected the next Tory leader will be a Brexiteer. That means Mr Javid, , who backed Reman but now supports Leave, would have a real fight on his hands to win round Tory members. He took over at the Home Office after Amber Rudd was forced to quit over the Windrush scandal - and has picked public fights with Mrs May on key issues like immigration and police funding. But his star has fallen over chaotic handling of migrants crossing the Channel. He was accused of stoking tensions by declaring a national emergency to deal with a few hundred migrant crossings over a period of months. Mr Javid, the son of Pakistani bus driver, would be the first non-white Prime Minister. Matt Hancock VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING: .     The ambitious -year-old entered politics as George Osborneaposs adviser and was in the inner circle of the famously cliquey ex-Chancellor. The parkour- and karaoke-loving Conservative entered Parliament in , Government in  and joined the DCMS in July  after Mrs May took over as Prime Minister. He was swtly promoted to Culture Secretary and then Health Secretary. But he came under fire for accepting thousands from the boss of a think tank which wants to scrap the NHS. Within days of the PMaposs announcement, he somehow found his way onto the Good Morning Britain sofa, where he said of leadership: I think you don’t rule out these things.” Laying out his policy stall beyond Brexit he said he wants to make Britain a high-tech economy exporting to the global middle class. And he said the UK needs to drive up the minimum wage at the same time as slashing tax. Esther McVey    VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:   The hardline Brexiteer confirmed she will be running for the Tory leadership with a pledge to slash £billion from foreign aid, and spend it on schools and the police. The former welfare-slasher and rank outsider said: Iaposve always said quite clearlyI got enough support from colleagues then yes I would, and now people have come forward and I have got that support. But former GMTV presenter Ms McVey became notorious among benefit claimants after working as a Minister and later Secretary of State in the Department for Work and Pensions. Her blunt style drew floods of criticism even when she managed to secure limited extra money for cash-starved Universal Credit, and U-turned on a benefit cut for the disabled.  Over the years, she made a number of controversial comments which turned her into a lightning rod for anger about benefits. She was ousted from her Wirral West seat in  after a sustained campaign against her, but ed in George Osborneaposs ultra-safe Tatton seat in . She made clear that under her leadership Britain would leave the EU on October  - deal or no deal. Kit Malthouse    VOTED: Leave   TRUE BLUE RATING:   The former Deputy Mayor of London under Boris Johnson threw his hat in the ring, clearly deciding he could do a better job. The -year-old was an accountant before joining Tory politics and winning the safe seat of North West Hampshire in . He quickly rose through the ranks, joining the DWP as a junior minister before being made Housing Minister where he had the tough task of dealing with fallout from the Grenfell Tower disaster. He ingratiated himself with Brexit-backing MPs by devising the aposMalthouse compromiseapos - a plan for high-tech border checks and other features to solve the Irish border issue. Critics say the plan is unworkable. He openly admitted making le uncomfortable for the homeless as part of a zero-tolerance crackdown when he was on Westminster City Council. Under his watch, the council was accused by one London Assembly member of adopting a ruthless policy towards homeless people that included hosing them out of doorways. Asked in he was behind such a hosing policy, Mr Malthouse replied: We certainly instituted a policy of making le - it sounds counterintuitive and cruel - more uncomfortable that is absolutely right. Still uncleartheyaposll run Penny Mordaunt VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    Recently promoted to Defence Secretary, Penny Mordaunt is a -year-old Royal Navy reservist whoaposs only been an MP since  - but has a rich slew of headlines to her name. From bellyflopping on TV ing show Splash! to slashing billions off benefits and lying about Brexit, sheaposs often been famous - and only sometimes for the right reasons. The daughter of a paratrooper and special needs teacher, who has a twin brother, the Portsmouth North MP went to her local comprehensive. She worked in a factory and as a magicianaposs assistant to save up for Reading University, which she was the first member of her family to go to. The PR supremo was director of communications for the National Lottery, head of campaigns for Diabetes UK, head of foreign press for George W Bush’s  and  election campaigns and chief of staff for former MP David Willetts.    Graham Brady VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    The -year-old, made a Sir in , holds Theresa Mayaposs fate in his hands as chairman of the  Committee. The august body runs leadership challenges in the Conservative Party and could change the rules to force Mrs May out. Heaposs currently its premier diplomat in the Tory war, but could reportedly sacrice his immunity to run for the top job himself. The grammar-school-educated MP for Altrincham and Sale West is a former PR man who turned MP in  and was the chief aide to former Tory leader Michael Howard. James Cleverly VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    The -year-old Brexiteer is a tub-thumping Tory whoaposs not afraid to go into battle on social media. The MP for Braintree has repeatedly got into spats with Labour since taking his job as Tory Vice Chair. Heaposs a boisterous character at social events and in the bars of Parliament, making up for a lack of Westminster experiencewith fierce public loyalty. David Gauke  VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    The pro-Remain Justice Secretary is highly unlikely to be putting his hat in the ring. But there is some suggested he could team up with fellow Remainer Amber Rudd to run on a joint ticket. He also gave a wide-ranging speech on Thursday  May straying beyond the confines of his brief. Mr Gauke took a swipe at populists like Boris Johnson saying: Populism would undermine the United Kingdom.  In the context of the United Kingdom, right-wing populism means English nationalism. The biggest problem with populist policies is that too often, they’re just plain wrong. Big hitters who ruled themselves out Amber Rudd VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    Amber Rudd was previously seen as a favourite to replace Mrs May. But as the party has drted to the right the moderate Remainer Ms Rudd had fallen out of favour. She was forced to quit as Home Secretary during the Windrush scandal. But after eurosceptic Esther McVey quit the government, remain-supporting Ms Rudd, , ed to government as Work and Pensions Secretary. She has a tiny majority in her seat of Hastings and Rye, which would make her vulnerable to any co-ordinated insurgency from local Labour backers. The Work and Pensions Secretary gave a wide-ranging speech on  May that called for a st Century approach to work in what many will see as a pitch for the Tory leadership. She said I hope a softening of benefit sanctions show her credentials as a so-called aposOne Nationapos Tory. And she admitted sanctions may have damaged the Tory brand, saying: If there has been damage I hope we can reverse that.  She dodged questions on whether she would throw her hat in the ring for the Tory leadership, saying: “I’m committed to the DWP”. But she later pulled out accepting the Tory party would want someone fully behind Brexit. Liz Truss  VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    The Chief Secretary of the Treasury is about as right wing as they come when it comes to economics. The -year-old also loves to tell a joke and hasnapost really hidden her ambition to one day hold the top job. She even posed in Westminster for a photo shoot and an interview with the Sunday Times, calling for £bn to be spent on tax cuts. And she appeared in a series of hair-raising photos with wide-bottomed trousers before giving a speech that ranged far beyond her brief. But disappointing performances in high profile jobs like her time a Justice Secretary left some MPs questioningshe has what it takes for the top job. She voted to Remain in the referendum - and since said she would change her mind and became a born-again Brexiteer. But she dropped out saying the leader had to be someone who voted Leave in .

Just % support plans from the Rail Delivery Group, which represents rail firms, for increased competition on the railways.

Ellen Lees, of We Own It said:“Private rail companies have been lobbying hard for more private involvement and increased competition on our railways. “This new poll shows just how out of touch the rail industry is. The public doesn’t want more competition, they want a railway they can trust, with cheaper fares that provide good value for money. “This is only possiblethe railway is brought into public hands.

Former British Airways boss Keith Williams, who is heading the review, has said that the current franchising model on our railways has to come to an end, and will publish his recommendations for the future of the railways later this year.

Candidates for Tory leader are lining up to back a hard exit in a pitch to the partyaposs , voting members. Some are fighting against crashing out of the EU without a deal - with Jeremy Hunt branding the plan suicide.But none are fighting to stop Brexit altogether, and none are fighting to hold a second referendum. Whoever wins the Tory leadership contest will be in  Downing Street by the end of July, and try to put their strategy in place over the summer.  That means they will have a massive impact on how we leave the EU on October , or whether we do at all.The EU could offer an extension beyond Halloween , or Parliamentary gridlock could force a general election.Britainaposs electoral system means we vote for MPs, not a PM - who whoeveraposs in power can steer Brexit without an election by you, the public.

So what are the candidatesapos positions on Brexit  And how likely are they to crash us out without a deal  Weaposve profiled their positions below - carefully finding comments theyaposve made since coming out for leadership.  Boris JohnsonHARD BREXIT RATING: .  The frontrunner declared heaposs prepared to crash out of the EU with no deal on October . We will leave the EU on October , deal or no deal, Mr Johnson said in May . To get things done you need to be prepared to walk away. But behind the scenes heaposs been less hardline, telling moderate MPs his preference is still a negotiated exit. One insider in his camp told the Mirror: He knows that no deal would be damaging. Butyou want to renegotiate youaposve got to keep it on the table. The problem for moderate Tory MPs, members and the public is this - which Boris Johnson should they believe  Leadership rival Rory Stewart compared him to liar Pinocchio, saying Borisapos no deal promise went back on pledges he made in private. And heaposs famously chosen his views opportunistically, coming out for Leave in  at the moment of maximum impact despite writing an article for each side. He did however burnish his Brexiteer credentials by quitting Cabinet in protest at Theresa Mayaposs deal. Dominic RaabHARD BREXIT RATING: .  The former Brexit Secretary backs leaving without a deal on October  -thataposs what it takes. He has said Britain should be getting a fairer deal and he would prefer to leave with a renegotiated deal. But he added the UK must calmly demonstrate unflinching resolve to leave in October - at the latest. Critics fear his hardline views will make him more likely to walk out of negotiations with the EU. That would plunge the UK into no-deal in October, or could force a general electionMPs revolt against the government. Mr Raab walked out of the Cabinet in November in protest at Theresa Mayaposs deal and has said itaposs time for a new direction. Jeremy HuntHARD BREXIT RATING:  The Foreign Secretary has said pushing for No Deal Brexit would be political suicide and could make the Conservatives extinct. He added MPs could force a general election against any Prime Minister who tried - putting Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street by Christmas.The comments, in May , are the latest stage in a long run flip-flopping opinions from Mr Hunt. He voted Remain in  but later tried to appeal to Tory Brexiteers, comparing the EU to the Soviet Union and branding himself a born-again Brexiteer and insisting no deal is better than no Brexit. In reality though, few believe he will choose a course he himself has said we would regret for generations.Instead he claims the solution is to change the Withdrawal Agreement Theresa May agreed with the EU in a new round of talks.Thataposs despite the fact the EU has repeatedly said it will not reopen the -page Withdrawal Agreement, which was finished in November  and has been blocked by MPs ever since. Mr Hunt also claimed he wanted Brexiteers including the DUP and Tory hardliners to join the negotiating team. But he refused to say he would involve Nigel Farage, whose Brexit Party won a landslide in the EU elections, or Jeremy Corbyn who he accused of bad faith. Rory StewartHARD BREXIT RATING:   The International Development Secretary is the biggest Remainer on the ticket - and has said heaposd refuse to work under a Boris Johnson government. He said No Deal will be a huge mistake, damaging, unnecessary, and dishonest that would destroy  years of reputation overnight. And he compared Boris Johnson to Pinocchio and Brexiteersapos thinking to the Wizard of Oz. Mr Stewart has met Unite chief Len McCluskey and plans citizensapos assemblies to find consensus over Brexit. He saidnecessary he would even work with Nigel Farage, adding: The whole point about this is: no red lines, talk to everyone. Esther McVeyHARD BREXIT RATING:   The Tory MP for Tatton is arguably the hardest Brexiteer on the ticket and says we should get ready to leave the EU with no deal. She demanded Brexit happens deal or no deal on October , no matter how damaging for business - something she called a clean Brexit. She said the next leader of the Tories has to be a Brexiteer as the failure to deliver Brexit has left many in the party demoralised. And she refused to rule out a pact with Nigel Farageaposs Brexit Party, telling the : Nigel Farage is a tour de force. He has changed the narrative. He has caught the mood of the moment. Ms McVey quit as Work and Pensions Secretary in protest at Theresa Mayaposs Brexit plans. Matt HancockHARD BREXIT RATING:   The Remain-voting Health Secretary said itaposs mission critical to deliver Brexit before a general election. The next election is only due in . So that implies he could accept another extension to avoid crashing out of the EU without a deal on October . His comments also suggest he would attempt re-enter negotiations with the EU. He said a no-deal Brexit simply wonapost be allowed by Parliament and it is time to be more honest about the sacrices Brexiteers will have to make. He said: She didnapost start by levelling with people about the trade-offs. I think it is much, much easier to bring people together behind a proposalyou are straightforward in advance. Andrea LeadsomHARD BREXIT RATING:   The former Cabinet minister has declared she would lead Britain out the EU with or without a deal in October. To succeed in a negotiation you have to be prepared to walk away, she said. She previously described the UKaposs continued membership of the EU as disgusting and claimed that a Brexiteer PM would have delivered Brexit already. And she was the final Cabinet resignation in a chain that fuelled Theresa Mayaposs eventual decision to quit. Ms Leadsom said she would introduce a citizensapos rights Bill to resolve uncertainty facing EU nationals. She would also seek agreement in other areas where consensus already exists, such as on reciprocal healthcare and Gibraltar. Michael GoveHARD BREXIT RATING:   In his leadership announcement, Mr Gove refused to sayBritain should leave the EU, deal or no deal, in October. Instead he said there must be a proper and informed debate about the options Britain faces. When it comes to No Deal, he said we would be able to get through it but it is better to secure a deal. The Leave-voting Environment Secretary was a Theresa May loyalist and urged MPs to pass her deal. Now Mr Gove is posing as a self-styled unity candidate to unite the Conservative Party, deliver Brexit and lead this great country. Meanwhile he has offered to introduce free UK citizenship for more than million EU citizens living here who would,they stay, eventually become eligible. That would waive the current £, naturalisation fee - though Commonwealth citizens in the UK would still have to pay. Sajid JavidHARD BREXIT RATING:   The Home Secretary has said his party must get on and deliver Brexit adding: Itaposs time to rebuild trust, find unity and create new opportunities across the UK. But he did not immediately clary whether he would take Britain out of the EU without a deal on October . The -year-old backed Remain in the referendum but has since positioned himself as a firm Leaver. Kit MalthouseHARD BREXIT RATING:   The Housing Minister, who voted Leave in , has emphasised the need for a cross-party Brexit plan rather than crashing out with No Deal. While I voted to leave the EU, I know that without unity across the UK, we cannot get a deal over the line, he said. Part of his plan, however - the so-called aposMalthouse Compromiseapos - involves mitigating a possible No-Deal Brexit. Critics also believe the plan is unworkable. If we leave with a deal, the plan would extend the transition period through to December . It would also renegotiate arrangements for the Irish border using as-yet-unclear technological solutions. It we leave without a deal, we would ask to pay the EU for a standstill arrangement ensuring tarfs and harsh border rules donapost suddenly kick in.

Chloe Nichols was one of thousands who descended on We Are FSTVL in East London this Bank Holiday weekend. But the occasion quickly turned sour however when huge queues started to form leading into the grounds. Thirsty and exhausted by the three and a half hour wait, a large group of fans began storming the entrance to the gig.    Chloe, a -year-old Mayfair Casino worker, got caught up in the scrum and was thrown against the fence. Got crushed in this yesterday trying to get into the festival, she posted on a video of the horror queue on Sunday. I cannot begin to explain how horrying this was. A young man pulled me from under the crowd. I’m convinced he saved my le.    The melee unfolded when organisers stopped people entering the festival due to a lack of wristbands. Hundreds became stuck in the crush and then toppled when people began pushing from behind. Chloe, from Hornchurch, was one of several women thrown over a railing in the tangle of bodies. After a gash in her leg was stitched together in the festivalaposs medical tent, staff told her to make her own way to hospital. She got in a black cab and headed to the hospital where she stayed until am the next morning.    Unable to even get through the gates, she has lost the £ she paid for a VIP ticket and £ on drink tokens. Iaposm so angry about how this has been so poorly handled, she continued. I now have a scar for le and feel traumatised.  hours since I was nearly crushed to death and not a single message from anyone at we are festival. A nurse told Chloe that eight people had been treated at the hospital for injuries sustained at We Are FSTVL. Lewis Mitchell, , of Southampton, had his legs cut and bruised in the crush. He said: If we could avoid a  hour queue in the blazing heat and a stampede I ended up in the bottom of, that would be fantastic today, before you kill someone.    A spokesperson for the festival urged those affected to contact  info@wearefstvl   They added: Due to unforeseen technical dficulties at the wristband exchange, customers had experienced longer waiting times and for that we apologise. Security were able to overcome these issues and barriers were quickly reinstated.  Five customers sustained minor injuries and all were treated on site before re-joining the festival. The situation was quickly resolved and measures including providing additional queueing lanes and dedicated water distributers have been taken to change the process on site today for the benefit of all festival goers.    Our sincere apologies for anyone that was affected by the issue at the gate. Our event planning is done in accordance to the highest standards, working with The Met Police, London Ambulance Service and London Borough of Havering and the London Fire Brigade. We take the security of our audience very seriously, and constantly review our processes to ensure a safe festival environment.

He put his le at risk to smuggle reports out of the city. Paul was even called to give evidence when Slobodan Milošević was tried for war crimes. He won awards for his work and now, almost  years later, he has ed to the city where he is a celebrity. Twenty eight years ago I said a tearful goodbye to Dubrovnik. I had spent almost a month in that stunning walled city as a besieging army threatened to do it irreparable damage. It was  and the country that was Yugoslavia was turning on itself. Croatia had declared independence and the Serbian dominated regime in Belgrade was extracting revenge with an attack on the city that brought in much of Croatiaaposs income through tourism. A city that was a UNESCO world heritage site.    By slipping past a naval blockade my ITN team had entered Dubrovnik and placed ourselves with the local population on the receiving end of one of the most one sided conflicts of recent times. Dubrovnik came under attack from land, sea and air with its defence left to a motley citizens army, many of its volunteers hotel workers and tour guides . As the weeks passed and the assault intensied we became the only international TV crew to remain and our efforts to show the outside world what was happening seemed to turn into a personal battle with the besieging forces. Initially we were able to use the local television station to send my reports via satellite to London until successive days of targeted bombing destroyed its transmitter and mast. For several days we then successfully transported cassettes containing our reports on speedboats that left Dubrovnik after nightfall and attempted to slip past the gunboats patrolling the approach to the port. That strategy ended when a speedboat was shot up and the skipper wounded.    Our most signicant report which included cameraman Nigel Thomsonaposs shocking footage of wire-guided missiles being fired into the old town was eventually smuggled out by the remaining members of my team on a ferry boat requisitioned to evacuate women, children and neutrals during a brief ceasefire. Nigel and I stayed on in Dubrovnik for another  days but we would not be as busy or challenged again. Our pictures being broadcast around the world coincided with the besieging guns falling silent. Our Croatian hosts believed the two events were linked and it was on that basis we finally said an emotional goodbye to people who had helped keep us alive on our regular visits to the front line, some of whom had not lived to see the ceasefire. There is an old saying You should never go back and for more than a quarter of a century that is the way I thought about Dubrovnik. The world had moved on and indeed so had I.  From Croatia the war correspondents circus had rolled on, to Bosnia, Kosovo, Albania, Chechnya, another Gulf War and Afghanistan until eventually I retired my flak jacket. Whyand risk a special memory  Last month ITVaposs On Assignment programme asked me to make a film about Dubrovnik in  through the eyes of someone who has seen its darker days. I agreed and soon discovered not all memories fade and there are still places where our industry is associated with more than fake news. As part of the On Assignment filming I had arranged to interview Dubrovnikaposs mayor Mato Frankovic to talk about his controversial strategy of reducing the number of cruise ships to counter overcrowding in the old town.  He asked could I drop into the town hall for a pre interview coffee and chat and warned there might be a member of the local press present. In fact I walked into a room full of TV cameras and microphones and a full blown press conference in which the first question was How does it feel to be back in the city you helped to save   The Mayor presented me with a special award as a Defender of Dubrovnik and that evening all three national TV channels and local programmes featured myand long excerpts from our  smuggled report, saying it had resulted in pressure from Washington and Moscow on then President Slobodan Milosevic to rein in his generals. Throughout our stay in Dubrovnik we were regularly approached by residents who just wanted to say thank you. One elderly gentleman insisted on calling me The Priest and went on to say ITN had sent outthe gospel of truth during the worst of times, independent eye witness accounts they came to trust and rely on as they were re-broadcast on local television. It was an altogether humbling and reassuring experience with the best moment coming when we visited a school to talk to sixth formers about the views of a new generation of citizens. They told us they had been shown all our  reports in their history lessons as the only reliable non-propaganda source of information from that time. What a wonderful thing to hear and what a reaffirmation of the role of honest eye witness journalism at a time when it has become increasingly dficult and dangerous to achieve.Paul’s ‘Return to Dubrovnik’ is one of three reports to feature on tonight’s On Assignment - ITV .pm"},{"url":null,"title":"princess eugenie reveals impressive fact","story":"NewsPrincess Eugenie reveals impressive fact about her mum Sarah FergusonPrincess Eugenie shared two photos on Instagram to celebrate what would have been Queen Victorias th birthday, but fans were distracted by Sarah Fergusons involvementShareCommentsByZoe ForseyAudience Writer:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror tv tv-news video the-young-victoria-trailer-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrincess Eugenie is a big fan of Instagram and regularly treats fans to fun photos on her personal account.

But for years rumours have circulated about cameras - saying, for example, that donapost actually work or that there are ways to avoid getting points on your licence. These  things are often said about speed cameras, and speeding in general - are they all true  Road safety charity Brake has been speaking to our sister site Gazette Live , about the truth behind some of the most popular claims. Letaposs take a look at what they said:    . Not all speed cameras work, some are switched off - True A Brake spokesman for Brake said: “Various Freedom of Information requests have revealed that some speed cameras are not fully operational in the UK. “Brake fully supports the use of speed cameras, and would encourage theto use of any cameras that have been turned off. Speed cameras are proven to reduce speeding, and can catch far higher numbers of speeding drivers than traffic police with mobile cameras. . You have to be speeding at least % of the limit plus mph, to get caught - FalseThe law states that a driver can receive a speeding ticket as soon as they exceed the speed limit on a road, eventhat is only by mph. However, guidance provided by the NPCC , suggests that officers do not seek prosecution of a driver until they have exceeded the speed limit by %, plus mph.    Brake says: “It is important to note this guidance is not legally entrenched, and that officers have the discretion to act outside it – drivers should be aware that this guidance also does not mean that they can break the speed limit legally. . If you drive really fast, you wonapost trigger the camera - False Nonsense. The only way to avoid triggering the camera is to stick within the speed limit. . Speed cameras must be painted yellow to be legal - False The Government wants all speed cameras in England painted yellow. Butyouaposre caught on a grey one before that happens, tough - the offence is still valid.    . Average speed cameras donapost really work and thataposs why some people ignore them - False The spokesman from Brake said: “Average speed cameras are an effective way to prevent dangerous driver behaviour. “They are particularly beneficial as they enforce limits over a longer stretch of road, preventing law-breaking drivers from being able to speed up again immediately after passing a camera. . You must be notied within a certain amount of time for it to be valid - True Brake says a driver caught by a speed camera, rather than a police officer, must be sent a Notice of Intended Prosecutionwithin  days. The notice goes to the inidual the vehicle is registered to. . You can request a speed awareness course - False Those eligible for a course will be notied by police. If you havenapost been offered one, forget it.  . You can do a speed awareness course more than once - Sometimes true Drivers caught speeding for a second time may be able to do a second course, dependent on the severity of the offence. But this canapost be within three years of the first speed awareness course, according to guidelines. . If you get a speed awareness course, you donapost have to declare it on your insurance - False Brake says: “Drivers who fail to reveal that they have undertaken a speed awareness course, who then later make a claim to their insurance provider, may find that their policy is invalid. Information on whether a driver has taken a speed awareness course is held by local police forces. . You can even get caught on a bicycle or horse - False “Whilst it is unlikely that a cyclist, or other road user on non-motorised transport, would be able to reach the necessary speeds to be above the limit, the law holds that legislation around speed limits covers only motor or mechanically propelled vehicles, said the spokesman for Brake.

The charity - which has helped more than , in the last year, a rise of  per cent - said it isnapost receiving enough donations of food to meet rising demand.    Amid the food bankaposs struggles, operations manager Bethany Biggar told the Independent: “Until we have a benefits systems that’s caring, compassionate and supportive, a minimum wage covering the essentials, and a workforce that is reliable and secure, we will continue to support those who need us. We will not allow people in Edinburgh to starve.” The Trussell Trust food bank network said a record .million parcels were given to UK residents between April  and March this year, an increase of  per cent from the previous year.    It said food bank use in its network has soared by  per cent since . Ms Biggar said the Edinburgh Food Project, which has seven food bank centres in the Scottish capital, relies on donations from the public. Without them, she said, it “simply would not be able to help people living in poverty”. She said the food bank has helped , people over the last  months, a  per cent increase on the previous year.  Between January and April this year, there have been , food parcel requests – a rise of  per cent up on the same four-month period in . Food parcels contain three daily meals with three days of supplies. Of those helped by the Edinburgh Food Project, which is part of the Trussell Trust network,  per cent have suffered changes to benefits and delays to benefit payments, the charity said. These reasons were the most common ones for their dependence on food banks. One case involved a mum-of-two whose housing benefit was cut because her elderly parent was living with her until she moved to a care home, the charity said.  More than halfsaid low income was the reason they turned to a food bank for help. Other reasons included homelessness, debt, sickness and domestic violence. After donors answered the call to Fridayaposs urgent appeal, the Edinburgh Food Project wrote on Twitter : We are overwhelmed with the response to our emergency appeal on Friday! Thank you to everyone who has liked, shared and commented on our post. The more people who see it, the more help we receive! Food banks across the UK have reported a rise in demand this year. The Trussell Trust said it gives out more food parcels in the North West of England than anywhere  in the country, and demand has gone up by  per cent this year alone, ITV News reported.  The North West was followed by Scotland, London, the South East of England and the West Midlands. A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions told : The reasons for people using food banks are complex.Meanwhile for those who need extra support, the UK Government spends over £ billion a year on support for those who need it, including those who are on a low income. “In addition, Scotland has signicant welfare powers and can top-up existing benefits, pay discretionary payments and create entirely new benefits altogether.” According to new figures released earlier this month, the number of people in work continues to reach near record levels, and the unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level for more than  years.

The Met Office is predicting a balmy start to June with temperatures set to be hotter than traditional sun destinations including Barcelona and Ibiza in Spain, and glamorous Saint-Tropez in the French Riviera. After a few more days of wet and cool weather, it will become increasingly warm and humid from Saturday, bringing the hottest temperatures of  so far.But it has triggered thunder fever fears as high pollen counts threaten to cause deadly asthma attacks. The best weather is expected in central and southern parts of the UK - but how warm will it be in your area    See below for our guide to how warm it will be in your region.Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said there remains uncertainty on the range of temperatures as forecasters wait for the warm air to arrive. The warmest weather could be enjoyed in places such as Norwich, north London and places away from the coast in the south-east. Temperatures could hit C on Saturday and possibly C on Sunday as June gets off to a brilliant start. But the heat wonapost be felt across the country.  Some places will see closer to average temperatures along with cloud cover and rain. Scotland Highs of about C are expected in the far north of Scotland, and -C from Aberdeen through to Edinburgh. Much of Saturday looks dry and bright but rain is expected later, and it will linger into Sunday. North East England Drier and brighter on Saturday with highs around C over the weekend. Rain is likely on Sunday afternoon. North West England Some brighter spells are possible on Saturday and it will turn increasingly warm and humid before rain arrives on Sunday. Temperatures in Manchester will be C on Saturday and C on Sunday, and it will be C in Liverpool on Saturday and C on Sunday.  Northern Ireland Belfast will see highs of C with rain in the forecast in Northern Ireland on Saturday and Sunday. Saturday will get off to a bright start before rain arrives in the afternoon. Yorkshire and Humber Brighter in the east of this region, particularly on Saturday where warmer with lighter winds, the Met Office said. Temperatures will peak at about C on Saturday and Sunday. East Midlands Saturday will brighten up with lighter winds, and it will feel warm in any spells of sunshine. The Met Office said highs of C are likely on Saturday, followed by C on Sunday.  West Midlands Saturday will be dry and sunny, and it will feel increasingly warm and humid. Highs of C on Saturday and C on Sunday are expected in Birmingham, but rain could fall in parts of the West Midlands from Sunday afternoon. Wales Saturday will be generally sunnier and increasingly warm and humid. Temperatures will peak around C on Saturday and C on Sunday through most of Wales. East of England This is one of the regions where the hottest weather is expected - potentially C on Saturday and C on Sunday. Norwich is the most likely candidate. The Met Office said: Brightening up with lighter winds on Saturday, becoming largely sunny and very warm, locally hot.  London and South East England Scorching conditions are also expected in this region - possibly C on Saturday and C on Sunday, with London the most likely candidate. The warmest temperatures are expected away from coasts. South West England It wonapost be as warm here as the east or south-east, but it will feel humid. Temperatures of about C are likely on Saturday and Sunday with lingering cloud. What is the Met Office saying  Mr Madge said: The indication is that we could see highs of C , isolated highs of around C, on Saturday, and the most likely candidate places for those would be places like Norwich, north London, those sorts of areas away from the coast, but in the south-east corner of the UK. And on Sunday we could see highs of C , even possibly C. So Sunday looks very much as though itaposs going to be a warmer day than Saturday. So we have got that warmth coming through. Once this warm front, and the air behind it, starts to pull across the UK then we will see temperatures starting to rise. UV levels and pollen counts will be high.  Scattered thundery showers may break out on Sunday with cooler fresher conditions already in the northwest spreading southeast to most,not all parts by Monday, the Met Office said.But the hot and humid conditions will lead to higher pollen counts, causing problems for asthma and hay fever sufferers, and triggering thunder fever fears.Thunder fever - a sort of extreme hay fever - occurs when there are thunderstorms and a dangerously high pollen count These storms can absorb pollen grains and cause them to explode into tiny particles that are breathed in. Dr Andy Whittamore, Clinical Lead and GP at Asthma UK, said: “The deadly combination of hot weather, widespread thunderstorms and rising levels of grass pollen this weekend could put more than three million people with asthma at risk of a potentially fatal asthma attack. When pollen is in the air it can inflame people’s airways, triggering asthma symptoms. Stormy weather can make it worse as it breaks the pollen into much smaller particles, which are then inhaled more deeply into the lungs.  “If you have asthma and are already noticing more symptoms because of hay fever, such as coughing, a tight chest or breathlessness, make sure you keep your blue reliever inhaler with you at all times. Take hay fever medicines and your preventer inhaleras prescribed. Sleet and snow showers possible Mr Madge said conditions have been quite cool and there is a possibility of sleet and even snow showers in the Scottish Highlands mid-week. Parts of England could see a frost in isolated areas on Tuesday night and the next few days. There will be a fundamental change once the warm front, known as tropical maritime air, starts to draw the warmer air across the UK, Mr Madge said. He added: , for example, some parts of England could see a frost before this warm front starts to work its way across. Weaposre expecting its arrival overnight so probably getting into the western parts of Britain by just after midnight.  And then it will work its way across, reaching all parts of the UK by later in the week and the weekend. UK hotter than Ibiza According to the Met Office website, Barcelona and Ibiza will see highs of C on Sunday, while St Tropez is expected to reach C. Bookmaker Coral makes this June - to be the hottest since records began. Some forecasters have claimed June could bring an extended heatwave, but the Met Office said it is too early to predict. Cooler, changeable conditions are likely across the UK during the first week of the month. Periods of wet and sometimes windy weather are likely to batter many areas, with occasional thunderstorms with heavy rain. The driest and warmest weather through the first week of June is expected in the south and east. The middle two weeks of June could bring a relatively settled weather picture across the country, the Met Office said. But it warned that thunderstorms and heavy rain could be triggered by warmer day time temperatures, and a low pressure area could bring longer spells of rain and strong winds. Temperatures will be near normal or warm overall for June, the Met Office said. Met Office five-day weather forecastTuesdaySunshine and showers today, these most frequent and heavy across eastern and central parts, where a rumble of thunder is possible. Elsewhere it will be largely dry and sunny with just the odd shower.Tuesday nightShowers gradually fading through the evening to leave a dry night for many and turning chilly.

The defendant took advantage of them emotionally and sexually, Assistant US Attorney Tanya Hajjar said.He sold himself as the smartest, most ethical person in the world. He compared himself to Einstein and to Gandhi. But defence lawyer Marc Agnilo told jurors all the women joined Nxivm voluntarily and that Raniere was merely a tough taskmaster, not an abusive criminal mastermind. Raniere has pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking, child abuse imagery and other crimes and faces le in prisonconvicted.  Naked meetings where only aposslave masterapos was clothed Raniere allegedly held meetings in which female aposslavesapos gathered naked on the floor around him while he sat in a chair and lectured them on philosophy, one of the women testied at his criminal trial. The former aposslaveapos, Lauren Salzman, told jurors in federal court in Brooklyn that he would preside over the meetings fully clothed. When he was unable to attend the meetings in person, the women would take a naked photo and text it to him - making sure he could see where they had been branded with his initials, Salzman said. We were to look unorm and happy, said Salzman, .  Belief he could affect weather, technology and heal sick with his aposenergyapos Witnesses at Raniereaposs trial have detailed how Nxivmaposs teachers portrayed him as some kind of god who would unlock a more fulfilling le for his followers.Salzman said some believed he could affect the weather , echoing the testimony of another former member. If he released a new curriculum, for instance, that might create a big storm, Salzman said.People also believed technology acted funny around Keith because of his energy, Salzman added. Raniere, who presented himself as a genius whose unique insights would lead to deeply fulfilling lives, enjoyed a near-mythical reputation among his acolytes, according to witnesses. There were rumblings about abilities he had among Raniere’s closest associates, including healing people and influencing the weather, one witness said. aposSlavesapos restricted to near-starvation diet of a few hundred calories a day Several female members of the alleged New York sex cult, including Smallville actress Allison Mack, became dangerously thin after following near-starvation diets at the direction of the groupaposs leader, a -year veteran of the group claimed. The longtime member, filmmaker Mark Vicente, is a key prosecution witness at the criminal trial. Vicente, who left Nxivm in , said he told Raniere that Mack seemed aposbrokenapos, and Raniere responded: I’m trying to break her. Mack, who starred in the television series Smallville for a decade, was one of five co-defendants, including Seagram liquor heiress Clare Bronfman, who previously pleaded guilty to Nxivm-related crimes. Vicente told jurors that the women would push their diets even further, limiting themselves to a few hundred calories a day, as penancethey slipped up. There seemed to be kind of a club of young women gathering around Allison Mack, and they just didn’t look healthy, he said. Salzman testied that one young woman, identied as Daniela, was confined to a bedroom for two years because she gained weight.  Women branded on pelvic area with aposleaderaposs initialsapos Members of the group were allegedly branded with Raniereaposs initials using a cauterising pen, often on their pelvic areas, in ceremonies which were filmed by members. According to court documents, Nxivm slaves were forced to undergo branding ceremonies, a process that would take up to thirty minutes. The women were forced to stand fully naked while a master ordered another member to film. Some of the victims were told that the brand stood for the four elements - air, earth and water - with the cauterising pen representing fire. But prosecutors allege the shape is a composed of Mr Raniereaposs initials.  , fee to celebrate leaderaposs aposbirthday weekapos Every August, Nxivm members - called Nixians - would dole out ,or more to gather in Silver Bay, New York to celebrate Raniereaposs birthday week, according to court documents. A former member testied that the week included tribute ceremonies to Raniere.The celebration, known as Vanguard Week and centered around Raniereaposs birthday on August , reportedly drew members from across the US and Canada.There was always sort of entertainment or dferent kind of tribute ceremonies to Keith from the dferent centres, or there would be like performances of singers, the witness said in court, according to the Times Union.But it was kind of all centred around the idea of a tribute to Keith and celebrating Keithaposs work. Sort of like summer camp for adults.  Dad of apossex slaveapos finds nude photos taken for aposmasterapos A British woman described her involvement in the alleged sex cult after her dad found nude photographs on iCloud that she had taken for aposgrand masterapos Raniere.The woman, who only used her first name in court, took the stand as the first witness in the federal criminal trial.Sylvie, a -year-old British woman, said she sent naked photos of herself until one day her father called her and suggested she get her own cloud-based storage account, telling her: I found your medical pictures. I felt shame, a tearful Sylvie said, telling jurors she did not want to engage in sexual acts with him but she said she felt she had no choice. The aposcultapossapos participants were allegedly forced to provide potential blackmail material, or collateral, such as explicit videos or damaging information. Raniereaposs lawyer, Marc Agnilo told jurors the collateral was used to confirm the womenaposs commitment but was never intended to be released. Nxivm aposcult leaderapos accused of raping sex slave, , and taking sick photos Raniere is accused of raping a -year-old girl and taking indecent photographs of her.He allegedly convinced the teenager and her three sisters to travel from their native Mexico to New York City. A court heard the -year-old began to rape the girl in the city and made her pose for nude photographs, one of which was shown to a jury.It is alleged Raniere imprisoned one of the older sisters in a room for nearly two years after she showed affection for another man.  She was made to write how sorry she was hundreds of times in letters, the jury heard.The -year-old was allegedly once ordered to enter a room and perform oral sex on a woman who had been blindfolded and tied-up as an offering to Raniere, the court heard. Marc Agnilo, defending, said Raniereaposs sexual encounters with women were consensual and he denied child abuse imagery and sexual exploitation accusations. This is something these people signed up for, the lawyer said. Control can be very bad. Control can also make Marines. Control can make gold medal winners.

When the cousin heard the baby name, her mind instantly went to the numerous jokes online involving the name Karen, meanwhile Stephanie was clearly oblivious. To make matters worse, she claims the other women they were with soon began mocking and gossiping about the name as well.    She wrote: When Stephanie was out of the room, everyone was immediately like, aposOMG that poor kidapos, and aposWhy would she pick Karen of all names apos I was uncomfortable about this conversation, given that everyone had been so positive about the name to her face. I thought more about it over the next couple of days and just felt really weird about the whole thing. The name is really loaded, to the point it could be detrimental to the baby, and she had no idea of the connotations to make an informed decision. So a couple of days later I tentatively brought it up. I told her I was so excited for the baby and just wanted her to have all available information when picking a name. I then started to explain that Karen has some negative connotations and has become sort of an internet joke to describe a specic kind of entitled middle aged woman.    She says her cousin was instantly furious and told her she was just being mean.

So she decided to ask the people of the internet whether she was wrong for bringing the meme stuff up in the first place.    More than  people responded to the post, with many branding her an a**hole.

So with all that in mind, she was shocked that her ring looked cheap and the diamond was tiny.   After a few days, curiosity got the better of her and she decided to ask how much the ring had cost. She said: He actually looked really proud and said he got it for a huge steal the jeweler said it was worth  but he got it for . Iaposm not going to lie. I was hurt. This man makes an incredible salary and he couldnapost even get me a ring worth a day of his salary. Not a single friggin day.I told him I appreciated the proposal and I do want to marry him, but I donapost really like the ring he picked out, it looks really cheap, it is cheap, and it seems like he didnapost really put effort into it.  So she gave the man an ultimatum - she would only marry himhe got her a ring she actually liked, one that cost around , instead of .He told me I was being materialistic and that heaposd be more comfortable saving that money towards a honeymoon or a house, she continued. He said he will get another ringI really hate my ring, but spending more than  was straight up not happening. I told him thataposs fine, but my aposyesapos is conditional on getting a better ring that I actually like, and he will be very hard-pressed to find one I like for less than . If Iaposm not worth the cost, then I know where he stands.    She later updated the post, revealing how heaposd recently spent , on a trip to Vegas and had wine that cost more than her ring. However this didnapost stop people from being horried by the whole thing. One person wrote: I understand that you donapost feel valued, but the way youaposve said it here kind of makes it sound like youaposre a gold digger. Another commented: She values the ring more than the engagement. Think about that for a moment. She wonapost marry him unless she gets a nicer ring. Is that the kind of we youaposd want  A third added: They shouldnapost get married and he should find someone who doesnapost base their relationship and love around money. Not everyone agreed though, some thought he should have made more of an effort with the ring. He is willing to spend big bucks on things he values, but not what she values. Even on something that is supposed to represent to the world his love for her. I see that as the fundamental issue here, responded a dferent user. A wedding ring is one of the most important symbolic gts you can give someone - it symbolises your commitment and investment in one another. Itaposs also something sheaposll wear everyday of her le and something all her friends and family will beg to see, posted someone .

The seven-month-old pooch was left abandoned in a ditch on a side road in Chainat, central Thailand, on Saturday. Luckily, a cyclist spotted the puppy thrashing around as he rode past. The terried puppy had thick black duct tape wrapped several times tightly around her jaws preventing her from eating, drinking, or breathing properly. The cyclist called police and nearby residents to help rescue the dog.  Footage shows volunteers placing a grilled chicken skewer by bushes in a bid to lure the distressed puppy out. They spent about  minutes looking around before the hungry brown Aspin traced the smell of the meaty chicken. Villagers had to approach the dog from behind and covered her head gently before they removed the tape from her mouth.    As soon as the rescuer took off the tape, the puppy quickly ran away into the field while the group cheered each other for saving the stray dog. Resident Apichet Somboon said: We never saw her around before and she didn’t seem to know where she was, so we believed that someone had been cruel and tied her mouth and randomly dumped her here. Luckily, we found her just in time or  she may be starving to death. We wish we could feed her before she ran off, but at least we were very happy to see that she was still healthy.  Police in the Baan Kuay district are now investigating to try and find the owner of the animal. Anyone found guilty of of abusing the dog could face up to two years in prison. A spokesman said: We have spoken to citizens in the area but nobody knows who owned the dog and nobody saw anything suspicious. Those who carry out cruelty to animals without reasonable cause shall be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or a fine not exceeding , Baht or both.

For the past  months Vyacheslav Borshchevskij and Richard Thompson have lived together on the MV Ethan in the Port of Quebec, Canada. They joined a crew ready to sail the boat after Bahamian company DD Maritime bought it from the Quebec-based Groupe ​​​​​​Desgagnés in the summer of  for more than ,in cash. A year later the new owners ran into financial trouble leading most of the crew to leave, CBC reported.    But not -year-olds Mr Thompson and Mr Borshchevskij, who decided they would wait on board until theyaposre paid what they say theyaposre owed - a combined ,Mr Borshchevskij has not seen his we and family since he left the Ukraine to fly to Quebec City in Canada a few days before Christmas . Mr Thompson has not seen his son since he left the Bahamas when the boy was five. Heaposs soon to celebrate his ninth birthday.    Due to legislation recently passed in Canada, ownership of abandoned vessels goes directly to the government, which would leave the men unable to get their wages back. Mr Thompson told CBC: How can we go home to our families with zero dollars  Itaposs an embarrassing situation. We basically kept the ship alive, because we know the ship is worthlesswe let it go,you donapost keep the electricity going, the radios warm, the water running through the pipes so they donapost freeze, The unlikely couple have learned to live together, taking turns to cook and occasionally leave the ship to get groceries.    Earlier this year a judge ordered the -year-old boat be sold. On May  it was handed to a new owner infor , , signicantly less than the men say they are owed. According to Mr Thompson there is no mention of either of them in the court ruling. Weaposve been forgotten, he said. The pair have filed a note of protest to the federal court in a bid to be the first creditors paid.    Mr Borshchevskij said he is dreaming of hugging his grandchildren, going on vacation and renewing his professional certication once he is off the ship. Mr Thompson expressed doubts whether he could face his family after paying to keep the MV Ethan working. One of the owners of DD Maritime, Chuck Deal, told CBC News: We are going to pay whatever bills and the crew. We are waiting for extra funding. It might take us a few months. A spokesman for DD Maritime said: Monies have been sent monthly for the crew also we planning on paying the balances as soon as we get the financing deal completed. We have never abandoned the vessel we were overwhelmed with the port bills and needed to get financing which took us longer than expected.

I have lived in East Kilbride for  years and they are a club I know well and they are desperate to go up into the leagues. It is a big town and I can see a bright future for them,” he said.O’Dea, however, said that his new coaching post with the Steelmen is his priority.He added: “I’ve already done wee bits of work towards next season and I’m really looking forward to it. One thing I’m certain on is that I want to be a manager but not for a long time.“The workload of a manager is massive. Coaching the team is probably the easiest part and I can’t even do that just yet.“I am very clear that I don’t see going from playing to coaching as natural. So I’m starting at the very beginning and I know I am a long way from stepping into a manager’s shoes.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united earn almost double amount of city rivals from spfl payout","story":"Despite playing in a ision below, Dundee United earned almost twice what neighbours Dundee recieved from the £ million payout this week from the SPFL.The governing body yesterday shared out part of an estimated £m that goes to Scotland’s  senior clubs over the year.The amounts y due to league placement.Despite that, United’s second-place finish in the Championship earned them £,. compared to the Dark Blues getting £,. for finishing th in the Premiership.Premiership champions Celtic were given £,,. while Rangers got £,,..Kilmarnock and Aberdeen were only separated by goal dference but the Ayrshire side won £, more through this payout with Killie getting £,. and the Dons £,..St Johnstone were awarded £, for their seventh-placed finish while Arbroath got £,. for winning League One.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

It is obvious to everyone that the pier not being open is a resource wasted.#Inveraray Pier has been in existence since . Comprising an older stone-built section and later timber structure, it was once a thriving hub for Inveraray#s herring fleet and a popular destination for passenger steamers. It was used by everything from pleasure craft to puffers, with the military also making good use of it over the years.In more recent times it has fallen into disrepair and was closed off to public access in the last decade.#When we heard it was for sale we decided to make a bid,# continued Mr Byrne.#It would have been a shame to see it fall into the hands of someone who would want to use it just as a private pier. It#s about securing its future.#The Byrne family intends to re-open the pier for public use # but Mr Byrne is keen to dampen speculation about the potential future uses for the structure.Before anything  happens, the condition of the stone and wooden sections must be assessed, and reports have been commissioned from engineers and conservation architects.#I don#t want to raise expectation unnecessarily, but the most likely scenario is that we look to re-open the stone pier first of all,# explained Mr Byrne.Repairs would be needed to the stone structure and ironwork. New handrails and safety equipment would be needed along with lighting and basic security measures such as CCTV.Beyond that, the future of the wooden pier looks less certain.refurbishment is not an option, alternatives might include floating pontoons, while the potential for dredging around the pier and harbour might be considered.Through an agent, The Argyll Partnership, the Byrne family has contacted the Clyde Marine Planning Partnership with a view to having Inveraray included in the fledgling Clyde Regional Marine Plan, stressing that the pier #represents a great opportunity to contribute to the economic, social and environmental needs of the Clyde Marine Region#.And the new owners have said that the community council, Inspire Inveraray and others from the area will be fully involved as the redevelopment takes shape. The plans are also said to have the backing of the Duke of Argyll.Mr Byrne concluded: #Hopefully local people will want to help and come forward with ideas.#I don#t want to raise hopes at this early stage, but I hope that buying the pier is a good thing to do.#"},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries 24 5 19","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe numbers drawn for the Kilmory Camanachd Club lottery draw on Monday May  were ,  and .

revealed that the council paid the sum over the last six weeks, in order to get a former employee to sign a non-disclosure agreement.The request has also revealed that Scottish Borders Council has spent pound, of taxpayersrsquo money on so-called lsquogagging ordersrsquo since April .Non-disclosure agreements are contracts which are signed by both employee and employer, and which typically prevent staff or ex-staff from publicising certain information.That information can range from commercially sensitive details, such as innovations or company finances, to anything likely to damage an organisationrsquos reputation.Non-disclosure agreements have also infamously been used to prevent employees discussing allegations of misbehaviour, with a number of high profile cases in the UK making national headlines.A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: ldquoNon-disclosure agreementsare included in ious types of agreement entered into by the council to resolve a situation.ldquoNDAs are included for the benefit of both the council and the other party parties.ldquoIt is important to note that an NDA is one part of an overall agreement to settle a dispute, and the majority of any costs will be met from within the relevant servicersquos budget.The contracts are sometimes used when employees and their organisations have reached a settlement to a dispute, such as a claim of wrongful dismissal, without going through a full employment tribunal hearing.Reacting to the payouts, Hawick and Hermitage councillor Davie Paterson said: ldquoI am a bit concerned at the use of no disclosure agreements, surely council tax payers are entitled to a full and comprehensive explanation as to why the council them ldquoThe public, quite rightly, will be asking why do the council have to pay out this money, they may be asking is there something wrong with the management at the top ldquoThe public would love to know why pound, has to be spent to keep a former employee quiet when this admin are making cuts left right and centre, but yet they can find pound, to give to former employees.However, the councilrsquos leader of the opposition, Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell, urged a more even-handed approach to non disclosure agreements.He said: ldquoSecrecy by a public authority is sometimes necessary, but any overuse does not reflect well on a public authority which should be committed to openness and transparency. ldquoI read of growing concern about the use of non disclosure agreements across a range of public bodies with Westminster MPrsquos, for example, calling for these to be made lsquoa thing of the pastrsquo.ldquoThat said I donrsquot currently think that Scottish Borders Councilrsquos use of these agreements is particularly out of line with their use by other Scottish local authorities. ,params: .pushldquoInformation is limited by some, for example Edinburgh and Aberdeen cities, refusing to respond to freedom of information requests for details. ldquoBut Glasgow City, who have responded to an FOI, and are a much larger local authority than the Scottish Borders, have applied non disclosure agreements more than six times as frequently as Scottish Borders Council over the last five years.ldquoI am minded, as chair of the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee, to discuss with colleagues on this committee whether to suggest we should scrutinise the councilrsquos use of non disclosure agreements. ldquoThis would, of course have to be done in strict privacy, but it might allow some reassurance to the public that these

charging for toilet provision would generate an income of pound, a year.However, the total yearly income was just pound,, leading councillors to vote to consider privatisation as an option for future toilet provision.Officers have been working to identy potential third parties which could take over the network, and they have been consulting with a private company which could oversee the design and maintenance of public toilets in the Borders.Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison, who serves as the authorityrsquos executive member for neighbourhoods and community services, told a meeting of Scottish Borders Council on Thursday that work was ongoing.He said: ldquoOfficers continue to work with community groups across the Borders who have expressed an interest in operating this type of

process will conclude in the latter part of this year.ldquoThis will allow members to consider which direction they may wish to take over the servicersquos future.Scottish Borders Council has also

Impressively, the Belarus fighter rose instantly, but was back on the floor by the roundrsquos end, saved from what looked like certain defeat by the bell.There was no escape for Baranchyk in round seven, however, Taylor hunting him down and connecting with shot after shot.To his credit, Baranchyk soaked up the considerable punishment he was receiving to hold his own in rounds eight and nine, before being rocked again in round  but just surviving to the bell.Knowing now he was well behind on points and that only a knockout would save him, Baranchyk emptied the tank in the final two rounds. Rather than trying to evade him, Taylor threw plenty of punches of his own, leaving the crowd gasping with concern on more than one occasion, but the Prestonpans ace stayed on his feet and knew he had

He goes to bed with his T rex, plays with dinosaurs constantly and knows even the complicated names of lesser-known dinosaurs.However, we have tried very consciously to allow our kids to be who they are and resist the gender stereotyping that defines what a girl should be and what a boy should be.But here was my youngest daughter, at the age of five, clearly articulating the ision between girlsrsquo and boysrsquo toys.Her list was in line with the way toys are still marketed. Often there are two versions of the same thing, one for girls and one for boys.Even some story books are defined in this way, with images and colours which are used to reinforce the gender identity of the object evengender is not specically mentioned.Donrsquot get me wrong, I have no problem that my son loves dinosaurs.But I do have a problem with marketing directed at my children to force them into a narrow definition of what toys they should like based on a patriarchal version of gender.In truth, itrsquos not so much the toys themselves but the emotions and ways of being that are deliberately connected to them.Itrsquos the idea that boysrsquo stuff promotes bravery, toughness, being fierce and adventurous, while girlsrsquo stuff promotes cuteness, romance, beauty and love.It is changing and itrsquos much better than it used to be because there is so much more awareness and debate about this issue. Gender neutral marketing is more common now, mainly as a result of public pressure.But as the conversation with my daughter shows, we still have a way to go.But does it really matter  Is it just a politically correct obsession that is making a mountain from a molehill ldquoBoys will be boys, after all, and ldquogirls are all sugar and spice, and all things nice.It really matters, of course, and I think it matters just as much for my son as my daughters, perhaps even more so.That may be controversial, but I believe that as gender stereotyping is being challenged, it is often more dficult for boys to free themselves from the traditional definition of male identity than it is for a girl.I say this as a father of four girlsand one boy.Perhaps part of the reason for this is the fact that being male is still in many ways the privileged gender, and so there is an understandable focus on removing the restrictive definition of female roles which limit opportunities for women.But the struggle for gender equality has to be a two-way processit is to be ultimately successful.We must also unshackle our boys from the narrow definition of what it is to be male, a definition which still remains powerfully entrenched in our mindsets and the way society works.I personally suffered from this when at school. I was ldquosoft, sensitive, a daydreamer. I was often made to feel I was not a proper boy. There was no space for me to realise that the lsquoladdishrsquo way of being male was not the only way.Irsquom not advocating taking the dinosaurs away from my son and forcing him to play with a unicorn or Barbie doll. Even I loved dinosaurs when I was young. But it does mean allowing him, and yes encouraging him, to explore sides to his nature that society would still label as feminine: nurture, co-operation, make-up, dresses, dancing, looking after dolls and toys, and feeling vulnerable and being allowed to express it.The best way to encourage boys to express this part of who they are is through role modelling by other men, especially in the early years of childhood when a childrsquos brain is forming, and the childrsquos view of how the world works is being created.This includes how to treat others on a personal level.So nurture and care by male family members can be a crucial part of this. But one gender inequality we rarely hear about is the fact that men make up only two per cent of early years childcare workers. And this is an inequality not just for adults, but for our children.It conveys the message to young children that caring and nurture is not a manrsquos job or a male quality. So we grow up believing this is lsquonaturalrsquo.And this idea is so entrenched that there have even been examples of parents complaining that a man is working in a nursery!Looking after children is as much a manrsquos job as it is a womanrsquos. Or it should be, and seen to be. But itrsquos not just about work, or even childcare or parenthood. Itrsquos about ways of being and understanding that there are hundreds of ways to be a man or woman and we all have the right to make our own path.Thatrsquos why itrsquos important from the beginning to show that therersquos no such thing as boysrsquo toys or girlsrsquo toys: there are childrenrsquos toys.Or perhaps more accurately, to show the emotions and qualities traditionally associated with them are not gender specic.As always, children teach us. When we got home, Lewis put his T rex to bed. ldquoHersquos tired, he said, ldquoand hersquos a nice T rex.This was my lesson from my son: a T rex can be nice.He summed up the issue as only a child can."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-25-years-since-east-lothians-independence","story":"Twenty-five years ago this week, the Courier proclaimed the news with the headline: ldquoItrsquos independence for East Lothian.This week, East Lothian Council chief executive Angela Leitch said: ldquoThe Local GovernmentAct of  saw the abolishment of the two-tier Region and District Councils to be replaced with  unitary authorities across Scotland.\"I believe this has greatly benefited East Lothian communities, as responsibility for major services including education and social work were decentralised from Edinburgh and instead became the focus of political decisions at a more localised level.\"Over the years, our politicians have ensured ongoing investment in all of our towns and villages, providing facilities for local people, developing our infrastructure and continually working to improve the services we deliver. This has been recognised in a iety of inspection reports that have confirmed that East Lothian Council is a high performing council and has an ethos which recognises the importance of working closely with its residents and communities.\"Our elected members all live within the county, understand local issues and can ably represent the views of communities.\"Previously, some political decisions about our county were approved by people who had no real knowledge of East Lothian.\"Local government reorganisation has improved both local democracy and the ability of local people to hold the council accountable for the decisions it takes.Here, we take a look back at how we reported the news that the county had secured its place as a stand-alone local authority in the upcoming local government reorganisation:East Lothian has won the battle for independence.In a dramatic about face, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has given in to the majority wishes of the population and decided it can stand on its own two feet.From , the district will once again become master of its own house as an all-purpose local authority.It means East Lothian councillors will be responsible for running a full range of services ndash from education and social work to rubbish collection and recreation.The Local Government Bill which will end the -year lespan of Scotlandrsquos network of region, district and island authorities is currently going through its final stages in Parliament.And earlier this week, Mr Lang ndash supported by local Labour MP John Home Robertson ndash tabled an amendment to give East Lothian the go-it-alone status it wanted.It was the high point in a hard-fought campaign by angry locals which began last year when the Government announced its original intention to lump East Lothian in with Berwickshire.But their success in fighting off that idea was not the end of the battle ndash they still had to persuade Mr Lang and his local government minister Allan Stewart that East Lothian was NOT too small to become an authority in its own right.They had also to force them to give up alternative plans to create an East Lothian-Midlothian-West Lothian authority ndash and more recently a proposal to merge East and Midlothian.As councillors and senior staff celebrated the announcement with champagne, [district] council chairman George Wanless smiled and said: ldquoWe are absolutely delighted with the outcome.He said it was dficult to say what eventually changed the minds of ministers.ldquoBut I have no doubt that the campaign the district council fought had a lot to do with it.He added: ldquoIf I was being charitable, I would say it was a case where the Scottish Office actually listened to the people for a change...It was, however, a ldquogreat decision for the people of East Lothian, who had supported the campaign from the start.ldquoI would like to thank all those who came out on the streets and took part in demonstrations in the early days of the campaign ndash and all those who wrote to Ian Lang in support of the idea that East Lothian should be an all purpose authority.Councillor Wanless totally rejected the previously-held Government view that East Lothian was too small to stand on its own.ldquoWe currently have a population of something like , and growing.ldquoBy the year  we could have at least , and my colleagues and I along with our officials are confident we can handle all the services that the new council will be responsible for.And he insisted: ldquoWe will do so in the same economic and efficient way the electorate have been accustomed to over the years.MP John Home Robertson said the White Paper to reform local government could have been the ldquodeath knell for East Lothian.ldquoBut people all over East Lothian fought back in a massive local campaign and we have won a magnicent victory.He paid tribute to Councillor Wanless and others who took part in the campaign, saying: ldquoWe have shown that public pressure can move even this Government.ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet.ldquoLocal government is all about providing important services to local communities and we must continue to fight to ensure that East Lothian is properly provided with the funds it requires through revenue support grants.The councilrsquos Conservative group leader, the Rev Dr David Whiteford, said: ldquoI am very pleased that the Scottish Office ministers have listened to the electorate.ldquoThe view of the electors all along has been consistent ndash that East Lothian could and should be an all-purpose authority.ldquoI believe East Lothian has the capacity and potential to become an authority on its own and its staff are well capable of serving very well the needs of all the people.He added: ldquoI am very pleased that that message has now been accepted by the Scottish Ministers and that they have departed almost entirely from their original plan.ldquoLarge is not always beautul and I think we can do better on our own.He believed the transition to a stand-alone East Lothian council would be fairly simple.ldquoThe staff structures are already on the ground and all you really need to do is build on that.ldquoI do not anticipate a great deal of dficulty.ldquoIt is a challenge.ldquoIt is something that we should think through.ldquoWe have a new council coming into being and we should try to run it in a new style way.ldquoI hope councillors will concentrate on the needs of East Lothian people and will try and make that their main concern.Said SNP councillor George Thomson: ldquoEast

I believe that the current cemetery is starting to near capacity so it is important that we see the new cemetery open soon.Fellow ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell added: ldquoAs the community grows, we need to plan for more burial capacity in Prestonpans.ldquoThere are still people who want to be buried following their death, and I know that being laid to rest in the place you love is really important to people."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/9740183.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"nicola-sturgeon-calls-for-new-scottish-independence-referendum-next-year","story":"Scotlands First Minister made the comments on a visit to Dublin, where she said the \"latter half\" of  would be the \"right time\" for a new poll.The SNP leader predicted victory in a second vote, with Scotland becoming \"an independent country just like Ireland\".She said: \"There will be another Scottish independence referendum and I will make a prediction today that Scotland will vote for independence and we will become an independent country just like Ireland, and the strong relationship between our two countries now will become even stronger soon.        name : ballot,target: ballot_,params:.push\"I want to see Scotland having the choice of independence within this term of the Scottish Parliament, which ends in May , so towards the latter half of next year would be when I think is the right time for that choice.\"Ms Sturgeon criticised the UK Government for treating Scotland with \"utter contempt\" over Brexit during the visit, when she met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.In contrast, she said Ireland had been shown \"solidarity and support\" by the EU.She said: \"We voted over % to remain, we have tried very hard in the wake of the UK-wide Brexit vote to find compromises and protect our interests, and we have worked hard across party lines to try to prevent the worst impact of Brexit, and we have been ignored.\"Scotland has been treated with contempt by Westminster and people are contrasting that with Ireland, that has been shown real solidarity and support from the European Union.:Glasgow backs remain parties in clear Brexit message to UK parties\"Suddenly this idea of being a small independent country in the European Union, we only have to look at Ireland to see the benefits of that and many people are having their eyes opened.\"The SNP has examined Irelands path to independence and planned to keep the pound before moving to a Scottish currency, she told journalist Dearbhail McDonald at the Royal Irish Academy.\"The proposition that my party is putting forward now is that we should follow the same path that Ireland followed when it became independent,\" she said.\"We use the pound which is our currency until such times as the economic conditions are right to move to an independent Scottish currency - its a perfectly well-trodden path.\"Ms Sturgeon said Scottish independence would strengthen the relationship between her nation and Ireland, adding her visit had \"highlighted the benefits of EU membership for Ireland\" and exactly what Scotland would miss out on \" taken out of the EU against our will\".\"Ireland is Scotlands closest international trading partner and our fth largest export market,\" she said.For all your breaking Glasgow news, click here, or head to our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages\"It is in the interest of both countries to ensure that we continue to work together and cooperate, not just on an economic level but also in dealing with similar challenges around political engagement.\"This is exactly why we must strengthen, not strain these bonds.\"Scottish Conservative chief whip Maurice Golden said: \"The SNP went into this election pretending to voters that it was nothing to do with independence.\"Yet within hours of it being announced, Nicola Sturgeon is specically using it to argue for separation.\"Thats fraudulent behaviour from an SNP government thats meant to be running the country, not trying to break it up.\"Voters punished Nicola Sturgeon last time she abused the Brexit process for her own selfish aims.

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":null,"title":"three-months-after-its-launch-how-strong-is-the-pulse-of-the-nations-newest-tv-channel","story":"Itrsquos a period in which the pound million channel dedicated to Scotland and Scottish content has, at times, attracted record digital audiences, won a quarter share of Scottish viewers, been the third most-watched channel in Scotland after BBC One and STV, reached more people between the ages of  and  than any other channel in Scotland, gained serious traction on social media and, in the best of its content, made good on its promise to give Scottish audiences programmes they wonrsquot see anywhere  and which deal with the issues and subjects that affect, concern and interest them .But itrsquos also a period marked by a wild iance in audience ratings , by whispered rumours of discontent and in-fighting, by a perceived lack of brand identity and by a barrage of negative headlines either questioning the need to have the channel in the first place or pouring scorn on specic programmes, such as The Nine or Catriona Shearer-fronted gameshow Wonderball.:  years of rock and roll - and all that jazzLaunching BBC Scotland in Glasgow in February, BBC Director-General Tony Hall outlined the aims of the channel. As he saw it, they were to celebrate Scotlandrsquos strengths in arts, comedy, science and ldquothought. To reflect the countryrsquos ersity. To allow audiences ldquoto interrogate the things that matter to them and, along the way, to ldquoreinvent public service broadcasting. BBC Scotland, he stressed, would offer space for discussion and debate alongside opportunities to ldquokick back and have fun. It would be about the country speaking to itself but also to the world. It would be local, national and global.In other words it would be a lot of things to a lot of people. Or it would try to be. So, three months after its glitzy birth and with the numbers soon to roll over to Day  of its existence, how is BBC Scotland bedding in  What do audiences think of it  And how well is it measuring up to Hallrsquos lofty claims Steve Carson, BBC Scotlandrsquos Head of Multi-Platform Commissioning, is predictably bullish about its prospects and its track record. To his mind the station is about trying to take risks, giving a  to ldquoa strong range of voices and communities and doing ldquonew things and dferent things. So far the strike rate is good, he thinks. Among the successes he points to are Getting Hitched Asian Style, a documentary series following a wedding planning company in Glasgow, the opening night screening of Nae Pasaran , and Last Breath, a drama documentary about a North Sea er stranded on the sea-bed.Identying a stand-out is ldquolike naming your favourite child, he says. ldquoBut I think Asian Weddings is something I was pleased to see hellip It was quite straightforward but it got into communities you donrsquot often see and certainly donrsquot often see in that sort of context.For an example of risk-taking that paid off he points to Sink Or Skim, which took a fond look at the World Stone Skimming Championship held annually on the isle of Easdale in the Firth of Lorn.ldquoThatrsquos not a subject many channels would have commissioned, but it was a beautully made piece and it was funny watching it go out and looking at social media because people were going lsquoI canrsquot believe theyrsquore doing something about stone skimming. Is this part of their sport portfolio rsquo. But by the end of it the same people were going lsquoThat was really goodrsquo.Sink Or Skim was a one-off but The Peoplersquos News is a weekly discussion of topical events in which ordinary Scots go in front of the camera and have their tuppence-worth on topical events. Those featured might not have the political contacts of a Laura Kuenssberg, say, but they have something just as important: context. They represent the social and political views of people in a spread of communities distant from London and far removed from the Central Belt. Itrsquos another example of the channelrsquos guiding principle that BBC Scotland should be a  for discussion and debate and again itrsquos a programme that wouldnrsquot have aired anywhere .ldquoWe could have done a dferent version of this channel which would have been a lot less risky and done a lot more of what other channels do, says Carson. ldquoA Scottish version of BBC Four, for example, would have been a less risky proposition. But we already have that, so we felt it was important to try new things, go for harder to reach audiences and deliberately take risks knowing that not all of them ndash in fact many of them ndash wonrsquot pay off. Thats what wersquore about.So which risks havenrsquot paid off ldquoThatrsquos like naming your least favourite child, he says. ldquoI think the programmes that we have originated between pm and pm have had a tough time, but again our medium term strategy was not to originate as much there. The Nine has had ratings which have gone up and down, but wersquove always said thatrsquos a competitive slot. But on a digital channel ndash and wersquore already the biggest non-terrestrial channel in Scotland with a three per cent share, which is well ahead of projections ndash audiences will go up and down across the night and the week.:  years of rock and roll - and all that jazzIf therersquos a lightning rod for criticism, The Nine is it. An hour in , staffed by a team of presenters and journalists that numbers  ndash at least in the publicity shots ndash and fronted by Rebecca Curran and award-winning former ITN journalist Martin Geissler, itrsquos the stationrsquos flagship news programme.A lot rides on its wellbeing and it seems a little peaky. It was reported that on one day in late April viewing figures dropped to just . They picked up the following day, to , but even on April , the first day of the inquiry into the Clutha disaster, they couldnrsquot quite hit . From a first night high of ,, thatrsquos a signicant drop.ldquoThe Ninersquos average is signicantly higher than that figure and its reach, which is really important in news, is reaching a quarter of a million a week, Carson counters. ldquoItrsquos offering something dferent. If you wanted to point at a show which is something we wouldnrsquot have otherwise done, The Nine is it ndash an hour long news and analysis programme which looks at Scotland, the UK and the world through Scottish eyes.So is it simply the right show but in the wrong time slot ldquoWersquoll see. Nine orsquoclock is a competitive slot but there is a demand there and people are turning to it. The appreciation for The Nine is very strong and wersquore finding that across the board. You might get some programmes that donrsquot have huge average audiences but the appreciation is strong.In a front page story earlier this month, London-based broadsheet the Sunday Times quoted a BBC source who called The Nine ldquoa turkey. The same source added: ldquoYou canrsquot have a channel that nobody watches. Journalists like their output to be watched and it wonrsquot be long until some of the channelrsquos main talent head for the door. Another source spoke of a ldquopoisonous atmosphere in the newsroom causing behind-the-scenes tensions which could cause key staff to walk. True or   ldquoThat is not the case, Carson says bluntly.Among the keenest watchers of how BBC Scotland has fared over these first three months is Dr Lisa Kelly, a lecturer in television at Glasgow University.ldquoIrsquove been pleasantly surprised, she says. ldquoI think I probably wasnrsquot holding out much hope at the beginning, primarily due to the budget ndash pound million for programming isnrsquot much to play with in the television landscape.To put the budget in context, the BBC is spending nearly three times that amount on the new EastEnders set. But funding aside, Kelly is excited by the apparent focus on nurturing and showcasing new talent. Shersquos also impressed by the choice of programmes and pleasantly surprised at the internationalism of its outlook. One innovation she particularly welcomes is the Next Big Thing strand, which screens short films such as as Meet Me By The Water by Scots-Asian writer-director Raisah Ahmed.ldquoI think therersquos been quite a range of programming. It seems like they are trying to be erse in terms of their representation. So obviously you have Getting Hitched Asian Style and The Nine, which is trying to tackle current debates around issues of representation. So I think it has been quite successful so far.And does it matterratings are low for some programmes ldquoI donrsquot know that it does this early on. I think itrsquos important that we have access to original Scottish programming at a local and national level.There are other challenges, she thinks, besides ratings. One is establishing the channelrsquos identity. ldquoIrsquom not quite sure what its brand is yet in terms of how itrsquos selling itself. I noticed that before the launch it was targeting young people with this notion of fresh and original ideas, but I donrsquot know whether theyrsquoll be able to sustain that.Another is proving that the bold talk ndash of nurturing young talent, giving voice to dferent groups and communities, taking risks and tackling ersity ndash will be backed by bold actions.Wherersquos the Scottish Phoebe Waller-Bridge, for example  And how embedded is the commitment to ersity and inclusion, to actually hearing new voices and seeing dferent stories rather than it just being rhetoric with no change Theyrsquore questions for which Steve Carson has a ready answer. Sothe Scottish Phoebe Waller-Bridge was out there with a project she was aching to make, is he convinced he would find her and commission it ldquoI hope so. And I think we are finding quite extraordinary talent at all levels and also stretching people who might already have done one thing but are now doing something . Like State Of It, which is Robert Florence [co-writer of sketch show Burnistoun] doing quite a scabrous satirical show. Itrsquoll be coming out in the autumn.There is data which can help, however. A measuring system known as ldquosocial listening can analyse social media responses to any subject and from that gain an insight into how that subject is viewed, expressed as the over-riding emotion associated with it.:  years of rock and roll - and all that jazzBBC Scotland set the algorithms running at launch and four weeks later the results came back. ldquoThe strongest emotion in social listening was surprise, says Carson. ldquoThat was really encouraging. So modern Scotland, outward looking, surprising and focussed on new talent ndash thatrsquos the core identity of the channel. SoBBC Scotland is a keyboard emoji, itrsquos a colon and a zero.Three months ago, the channel launched with a Miracle. Whether itrsquoll need another one to make it sing in the long term is harder to judge. As they probably donrsquot teach you to say in continuity announcer school, watch this space.BBC Scotland: The Good, The Bad And The NineGetting Hitched Asian StyleA behind-the-scenes documentary following Glasgow wedding planners Saffron Events as they prepare for a succession of glamorous weddings, Getting Hitched Asian Style proved so successful that it received a repeat run on BBC One and has been re-commissioned for a second series on BBC Scotland. Produced by the Scottish ision of London-based Firecracker Films itrsquos a good example of the channelrsquos stated commitment to programmes which reflect Scotlandrsquos ersity. Verdict: funny, interesting, occasionally jaw-dropping but ultimately humane.A View From The TerraceBorn out of The Terrace, a long-running podcast, AVFTT is fronted by four young presenterswho sit on sofas and talk engagingly about Scottish football. Refreshingly free of Old Firm bias itrsquos fast becoming a Friday night staple for those fans of the Beautul Game who think subjects such as the on- and off-field shenanigans of Partick Thistle legend Chic Charnley or how Eriskay has one of the best pitches in the world are as worthy of discussion as whorsquoll be the next manager of Real Madrid. Verdict: a great signing.Sanjeev Kohlirsquos Big TalkA weekly show in which the comedian is joined by a  of guests for a ldquosideways look at the big issues of the week, filmed in what looks like the foyer of the BBCrsquos Pacic Quay HQ in Glasgow in front of what looks like a smattering of audience members. ldquoI never in my le want to endure another excruciatingly mirthless hour of supposedly witty commentary on the weekrsquos news, wrote one Herald critic. ldquoIt was so awful the only way to hang on to consciousness was to watch what was happening outside the glass-fronted studio. Less trenchant criticism has concentrated on the showrsquos stfness and its uneven format. Verdict: could do better.WonderballItrsquos probably destined for cult status among Generation Z-ers as an endless source of memes, but in the here and now BBC Scotlandrsquos flagship gameshow hasnrsquot been exactly showered with love. Letrsquos not take it too far, though: Wonderball is not, as right-leaning tabloid the Daily Mail has suggested, the worst show of its type ever aired, eventhat paper might like it to be. But you canrsquot say that those who have pointed out its flaws ndash the somewhat complicated rules, say, or the unintentional snigger value of two young men being instructed to play with the blue balls ndash donrsquot have a case. It hasnrsquot been a ratings hit either, with viewership dropping as low as  for one episode. Verdict: not utterly pointless, but not likely to become the next Pointless.The NineA team of talented and accomplished presenters, a  minute running time and a news agenda that blends hard-hitting investigations with quirky or thought-provoking items hasnrsquot stopped BBC Scotlandrsquos flagship news programme taking considerable flak from some quarters. Earlier this month one newspaper talked of a ldquotalent exodus from the channel and quoted a BBC insider who called The Nine ldquoa turkey. Damage has undoubtedly been done as a result: negative news stories about behind-the-scenes tensions and potential resignations may not be true, but they contribute to a narrative of failure which becomes hard to shake over time. What is true is that ratings for The Nine have been disappointing on occasions, though in mitigation its time slot doesnrsquot help. Verdict: a rocky start for a potentially stellar offering that may flourish in a dferent time slot."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9898940.jpg?type=article-full","title":"dont-miss-these-hidden-gems-in-stirlingshire-and-perthshire","story":"INNERPEFFRAY LIBRARYThe spectacular Library and School at Innerpeffray were founded by David Drummond rd Lord Madertie in around , the first free public lending library in Scotland.

Theresa May has, so far, announced only that she plans to quit as Tory leader on June , but will remain Prime Minister until her successor is elected , secures the confidence of the Commons and gets rubber-stamped by HM The Queen.On Mrs Mayrsquos track record of promising to leave something, but not managing it, shersquoll still be Tory leader in  and, having fiddled all the rules to get some sort of extension, PM long after the next scheduled General Election. If that appalling state of affairs were to come about, though, she would no doubt insist that it was someone rsquos fault. The EUrsquos fault. The ERGrsquos fault. The Remainersrsquo fault. The votersrsquo fault.:Andrew McKie: Solution to political chaos is as necessary as it is unlikelyNone of that will wash. Itrsquos all her fault. Mrs May is the most catastrophic prime minister since Lord North probably worse. She had lots of room for manoeuvre, as he did not. Thatrsquos a harsh judgment, but itrsquos based on the terms she set, and whichshe was not pushed into, but herself chose. Her dreadfulness is not just a consequence of her own abject failures, but because shersquos made things much more dficult for her successor than they would have been three years ago.Some people think that this judgment is premature, because the next Prime Minister may be even worse. This accords with the narrative ndash popular with Remainers who think the public canrsquot be trusted with a say in their own governance, unless it conforms with the views ofthe political classes ndash that Brexit was an impossible aspiration and any attempt to implement it was bound to be damaging.On this analysis, the worse Mrs Mayrsquos successor fares, the more kindly history will judge her. When whichever of the  Tory MPs standing gets the job, and makes just as big a mess of it, we will see that she was dealt an impossible hand, and played it as well as she could.Irsquom afraid thatrsquos nonsense, too. In poker terms, she was dealt at worst a pair of sixes, and promptly swapped them for seven two offsuit. Those who complain about the lack of specics in the Leave campaign, and a failure to spell out exactly how Brexit would be implemented, canrsquot also maintain that Mrs May had limited options when she emergedas Tory leader in .That would have been that moment at which any halfway capable person would have said: ldquoI promise we will respect the result, but before we go any further, we should establish the terms on which we go, and each of the possibilities involves some trade-offs.Faced with the range of options with which we are now drearily familiar, from Canada +++ to WTO terms, she could have spelt out which might createborder problems in Northern Ireland, restrictions on taking greater control of our agricultural or fisheries, oblige us to continue to abide by EU regulations or ECJ oversight, prevent us from ending unrestricted freedom of movement, and so on.We could even have had, for example, a series of indicative votes in Parliament to see which aspects of Brexit enjoyed enough support to make them worth negotiating for, which were regarded as essential, and which could be conceded in order to protect trade, industry or the financial sector. Did Mrs May even think about any of that  Apparently not.:Andrew McKie: Pointless European elections will just prolong our tormentFor the first nine months or so of her premiership, the only statement we got was ldquoBrexit means Brexit. Unless yoursquore a primary school teacher attempting to explain the reflexive property of the equals sign, this is of limited value in conveying information, evenwe now know that the translation is: ldquoIrsquom not telling you, because I have no idea what Irsquom doing.Worse, the fact that Mrs May didnrsquot know what she was doing didnrsquot stop her from preventing everyone  from pursuing the options. Her succession of Brexit secretaries, who all resigned because she wouldnrsquot let them do their jobs, may have been ndash as the Remain camp naturally claims ndash rubbish, or faced with the impossible. But wersquoll never know, because they never got to negotiate.Instead, at some point, the Prime Minister came up with new definition of Brexit. It was, apparently, a set of red lines. These, as it transpired, were akin to those the teacher puts through the wrong answer, or those used in alarming graphs showing that your approval rating is falling through the floor. And she was dishonest about the limits they created, and theconcessions that she immediately surrendered to Brussels.In part, thatrsquos because of the monomania about immigration she carried over from her time in the Home Office, which immediately ruled out most of the attractive methods of delivering Brexit. But the lessons of Mrs Mayrsquos previous job were not just that she was callous, authoritarian, stubborn, unreasonable and technocratic, though she was all of those. Itrsquos that she didnrsquot even deliverimmigration was her big thing, she failed for  years to do anything about it.A better politician might even have sold her terrible Withdrawal Agreement , but shersquod already proved, in the worst election campaign ever conducted, that she was a terrible politician. Failing to gain a majority against Jeremy Corbyn, Labourrsquos worst and least popular leader ever, was seen, even as her campaign was collapsing almost comically, as an impossibility. Yet she managed it.Itrsquos perfectly possible, perhaps even likely, that the next Prime Minister will prove terrible at delivering a good Brexit, but that shouldnrsquot improve historyrsquos view of Mrs Mayrsquos time in office. Itrsquos her decisions, and hers alone, that have led us to this sorry pass. The only way forward is to acknowledge that every one of them was an error, disown them all, and start again."},{"url":null,"title":"leonard-faces-msps-wrath-after-labours-euro-wipe-out","story":"The Scottish Labour leader also faces calls for an emergency meeting of the partyrsquos ruling body in Scotland which could potentially discuss his future.One party source said no one wanted another leadership contest, but the decline during Mr Leonardrsquos  months in charge was so bad every MP and MSP now feared for their job.Labour, which once dominated Scotland for generations was reduced to fth place in the European election, slumping from  to  per cent of the vote and losing both its MEPs, including David Martin, the UKrsquos longest-serving MEP, who was first elected in .:Tories and Labour panic as election sparks demand for Brexit and indyref votesIt was the partyrsquos worst result north of the border since .Even in the former Labour heartland of Glasgow, Labourrsquos vote fell from  to just %.Two Scottish Labour MPs issued an excoriating public criticism of Mr Leonard, his lieutenants, and the UK Leader Jeremy Corbyn for the partyrsquos disastrous performance.Edinburgh Southrsquos Ian Murray and East Lothianrsquos Martin Whitfield said voters had delivered an ldquoutterly damning verdict on Labourrsquos ambivalence on Brexit, and said of Mr Corbyn and Mr Leonard: ldquoThey stuck their heads in the Brexit sand because they canrsquot lead.Demanding Labour support a Peoplersquos Vote, they said: ldquoIf we fail to listen and learn, our party will never recover.ldquoThey criticised for Mr Leonard, a Corbyn loyalist, for ldquomeekly echoing the UK labour campaign, even putting Mr Corbynrsquos face on leaflets instead of the Scottish leader.They wrote: ldquoThe blame for the worst result in Scottish Labourrsquos history lies squarely with our partyrsquos leadership.ldquoIt is official Labour Party policy to support a Peoplersquos Vote as a way out of this catastrophic mess, yet Jeremy Corbyn snubbed our membership and refused to embrace it.ldquoAs a result, he personally handed victory to Nigel Farage.ldquoThis was Jeremy Corbyn and Richard Leonardrsquos manesto, their message, their decision to ignore the membership and what voters were saying to us.ldquoIt was their election campaign and their mess.

I request that an urgent meeting of the SEC is scheduled as soon as possible to discuss how this position is going to be resolved.Remarkably, Mr Leonard initially responded to the result by issuing a statement that didnrsquot mention Brexit.ldquoThe isions caused by the competing nationalisms of the UK and Scottish Governments continue to be a distraction from both of their failures, he said.ldquoLabour must, and will, do more to challenge these failures and put forward our positive alternatives to invest in our people, our communities and our public services.He later issued an email to party members admitted the public had lost trust in Labour, declaring he now backed ldquothe option to remain and that any Brexit deal should be ratied by a second public vote.However even this appeared to be parroting Mr Corbynrsquos position and relied on a ldquodeal that looks as far away as ever.Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson said: ldquoLabourrsquos result was catastrophic for a party that had near hegemony in Scotland in my letime.

In this modern tale of two cities, therersquos little doubt which one can look forward to the best of times.In contrast, Aberdeen has failed to exploit the advantages bestowed by geological and geographical accident. Oil and gas brought unprecedented wealth and prosperity to the North East. The evidence is still here from over-priced housing to the infestation of x vehicles designed to combat kangaroos in the Australian outback, but now choking city roads.The bonanza brought personal prosperity to many. Unfortunately, it also created arrogant complacency that ignores the finite nature of oil and gas. The absence of civic vision and investment is immediately obvious, even to the casual visitor.

Aberdeen may well be unique amongst the worldrsquos ldquoenergy hubs in its failure to exploit the windfall to enhance its appearance, facilities and cultural le.Having lived in the Aberdeen area all my le, I cannot name a single building of architectural merit constructed in that time. When presented with an open goal to enhance two of the cityrsquos most important historical buildings, the council again missed the target, opting for another nondescript retail development.Sure, it can be argued that the new concert, conference and exhibition hub nearing completion is a symbol of the cityrsquos ambition.

However, there is evidence to suggest that traditional loyalties to mainstream political groups have experienced a signicant sht as voter frustration with the perceived torpor of the historic two main partiescontinues to grow.Regardless of why they voted for the Brexit Party, I presume that those who did are aware of the partys broad aims and policies, even although they have no manesto.The Brexit Party is essentially a company that masquerades as a populist group centred on a leadership cult. Many media outlets believe the group is funded by dark money with the businessman, Arron Banks, acting as puppet master to the narcissistic Mr Farage. The original leader, Catherine Blaiklock, resigned in March of this year after posting Islamophobic comments online. Shortly afterwards, the party treasurer Michael McGough also resigned following anti-Semitic and homophobic social media posts.Though Mr Farage attempts to adopt a veneer of respectability, the party is essentially xenophobic and racist, mirroring much of the European far-right parties at present. He is an opportunist with short-term soundbites but no long-term economic or social strategy. Mr Farage thrives on chaos and disorder and, like most extremists, only presents as a solution in times of desperation and despair.The partys constitution advocates lowering of taxation for the wealthy and a desire to diminish the role of the state, in short, a dismantling of the NHS, the eradication of or swingeing cuts to benefits and an Americanisation of workers rights.If you did decide to vote for the Brexit Party under the disingenuous guise that the referendum result must be honoured above all commonsense then so be it.

Scots law, to measures such as the smoking ban and the outlawing of drink-driving.In such issues legislative change had been needed before there was a cultural sht, the Green MSP said.He stated: \"I firmly believe that as with the smoking ban we will see public opinion change over time.\"As Bruce Adamson, Scotlands children and young peoples commissioner told the committee you need legislation to

action\" as he said: \"A growing body of international evidence shows that physical punishment of children is harmful to their development and not an effective means of discipline.\"He continued: \"We often in Scotland talk about zero tolerance for domestic abuse and violence, but we allow the use of physical punishment for children.\"This sends a message to our children that hitting someone is a way of resolving a dispute, oryou dont like their behaviour.\"Tory MSP Oliver Mundell spoke out against the proposals, saying that \"however wellmeaning\" the Bill was it was \"an assault on family

subjecting good parents to criminalisation, and the suggestion that it is justied and reasonable for the state to intervene in family le where child welfare is not at risk, I cannot agree.\"However

have been using for many years, continuing to use that to recognise the situations where parents need support and to put in support.\"With the Scottish Government backing the Bill she added: \"Were not telling parents how to parent, what we will do is continue to provide support for parents so they can decide for themselves the best way to take care of their children.\"The defence of \"reasonable chastisement\" is \"antiquated,\" Ms Todd insisted, saying at its heart was the \"concept that it can sometimes be reasonable to strike a child\".She told MSPs: \"That is completely at odds with our aim for Scotland to be the best place in the world for children to grow up.\"We can contribute to that aim by providing children with he same legal protection from assaults as adults have.\"Labours Mary Fee echoed that message, saying: \"By giving children equal protection from assault, we are protecting children and safeguarding childrens human rights.\"Mary Glasgow, the chief executive of the charity Children st, said: \"Today, MSPs have taken a momentous step towards Scotland becoming the first UK country to end physical punishment of children.\"The overwhelming majority

users to improve the safety of workers by disposing of their litter responsibly.One of Aberdeen Road Limited’s duties during its -year maintenance contract is to carry out litter picking when required. This means workers have to collect litter by hand that has either been dropped from passing vehicles or left behind in lay-bys.Douglas Laird, Transport Scotland’s Project Manager for the AWPR B-T project explained: “The process of collecting litter from the side of a trunk road places road workers right next to high speed traffic, which can be dangerous. However, this type of work would be unnecessaryeveryone took their litter home with them. We are therefore asking road users to consider the safety of workers, not to mention the environment, before throwing litter from their vehicles.“The benefits of this project are expected to be wide-ranging, including reducing congestion, improving journey time reliability and enhancing safety, as well as attracting new business and tourists to the area. “The new trunk road gives everyone a snapshot of how beautul the north east is, so keeping it free from litter will create a good impression for visitors and give everyone the chance to see the North East at its best.”Malcolm Findlay, General Manager, Aberdeen Roads Limited commented: “We would like people to take all of their litter home with them, instead of discarding it on the new trunk road, so we don’t have to ask our road workers to clear it up. Our workers are already busy patrolling the new road to ensure it is operating as it should, as well as helping road users who need assistance.“In addition, litter-picking in certain areas of the road will require temporary traffic management to be implemented, which has an impact on road users by reducing the number of lanes available.”Inspector Steve Manson from Police Scotland said: “Littering is an offence which is thankfully unacceptable to the majority of people. However, it is becoming an issue on the new road.“Workers have to be located in close proximity to fast moving traffic to remove litter and these works can themselves be a distraction to road users. Littering on a road can also cause damage to vehicle tyres or windscreens.“In circumstances where road policing officers observe anyone to be littering on any road, they will take appropriate action.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The Kilted Chef Craig Wilson raids Oldmeldrum local Liz Millars fridge\"  Kilted Chef sets out to reduce food waste viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"changes to come at aberdeenshire hwrcs","story":"As part of Aberdeenshire#s sht towards greater recycling rates and sending less materials to landfill, tyres and asbestos will no longer be accepted at any of the area#s Household Waste Recycling Centresfrom Monday, June .The change, which also applies to four of the council’s waste transfer stations, is expected to save around £, a year and have minimal impact on householders. The money saved will be used to employ extra staff at recycling centres, who will advise customers how best to dispose of materials, helping to increase recycling rates and reduce disposal costs. Tyres are not classed as household waste and the council has no legal responsibility to deal with them – anyone buying new tyres can pay for disposal of the old ones at the same time. Although one of the lowest tonnages of any materials handled at HWRCs, tyres are one of the most expensive to dispose of. With very limited options to recycle or reuse them, they are currently sent to a cement kiln for use as fuel, at a cost to the council. Asbestos, only currently accepted by the council at four sites under limited circumstances, is currently sent to a specialist landfill site for disposal at signicant cost. Although tyres and asbestos together only account for less than .% of the waste handled by the council each year, neither method of dealing with these materials is classed as recycling. Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: “We know a very small number of Aberdeenshire residents bring tyres or asbestos to the council for disposal. This service is an expensive one to provide and only benefits a few residents. “Neither of these materials contribute to the council’s recycling rate, but they do cost signicant amounts of money to deal with and take up space at the facilities where they are collected. “Requiring the person or company which generates this type of waste to ensure it is disposed of correctly at their expense not only saves the council money which is being reinvested in better services, it also frees up space for the recycling of other materials in future.“Many tyre retailers offer a disposal service for old tyres for a small fee and vehicle users should make use of this service where possible, as most people do.“There are commercial companies who will accept asbestos waste for disposal at two licensed landfill sites for a fee and anyone disposing of this material is advised to contact them.” Signs will be in place at facilities which have accepted the materials in the past advising of the change.

Multiple entries are allowed with the competition running until Friday, May , next week. Those who take part are in with the chance of winning a Nikon B Coolpix camera.Ian Findlay, chief officer at Paths for All, said: “Orkney has a number of great walking routes — whether it’s residential streets or local paths and green spaces — and we’re keen for the community to celebrate how they make these part of their daily routines.“We want the photos to be a true reflection of everyday walking — walking that builds friendships, gives you headspace and gets you feeling fitter and out enjoying nature.“Walking can help prevent ill health, build communities and create a happier, healthier, greener Scotland and we know that people can demonstrate just that with their Humans of the Walk photos. “We want to revolutionise the way people use their cities, and stop our spaces from being dominated by cars. Scotland’s towns and cities should be a backdrop for people walking, scooting, cycling or simply spending time enjoying cleaner, quieter, calmer streets.“Paths for All is looking forward to seeing them all and wish everyone who enters the competition the best of luck.”Paths For All#s aim is to signicantly increase the number of people who choose to walk in Scotland, whether it’s walking for leisure, to work, to school or to the shops. The charity works to create more opportunities and better environments for walking, as well as cycling and other activities to help make Scotland a more active and greener place.For more information on Humans of the Walk and the competition, visit: https:www.pathsforall.org.uk humanscopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is both the highest volume of advance sales ever achieved in the voluntary-run festival’s -year tenure, as well as the greatest number of pre-festival sellouts. Stromness, the festival’s hometown in Orkney’s West Mainland, has already begun welcoming early arrivals, including some of this year’s furthest travelled visitors # Cape Breton’s globetrotting powerhouse quartet, Còig # as well as famed Irish singer Cara Dillon and Irish firebrands Four Men and a Dog, who are currently celebrating their th year on the road.Whilst early arrivals are no rarity for the festival, a far greater number than usual are already in Orkney, owing to a one-day Air Traffic Controllers’ strike across Scotland’s Highlands and Islands taking place today. As well as the closure of Kirkwall Airport, Inverness — a hub for flights from Ireland and England, before the final hop up to the islands — is also shut. With just a fortnight’s notice,  inbound arrivals originally scheduled for today, Thursday, have been rerouted, leading to early arrivals for most.Those already enjoying Orkney’s famed hospitality will soon be joined by fellow headliners including the groundbreaking Scottish three-piece, Lau a newly formed trio of celebrated Irish musicians John Doyle, Dermot Byrne and Éamonn Coyne and internationally renowned Hebridean vocalists, Julie Fowlis and Kathleen MacInnes, who visit Orkney as part ‘Between Islands’ # a collaborative project led by Stornoway’s An Lanntair, uniting musicians from Orkney, Shetland and the Outer Hebrides. Emerging artists are also prominent in this year’s festival programme, with appearances from BBC Radio Scotland’s Young Musician of the Year , Benedict Morris new Scottish six-piece Heisk and Helensburgh fiddler Ryan Young, whose accompanist, Jenn Butterworth, will work a double-sht across the next four nights, also playing with the high-spirited Glasgow group Kinnaris Quintet. In total,  acts will meet in Stromness — with the  visiting acts welcomed and outnumbered by Orkney’s thriving local folk scene, which itself features internationally renowned artists such as Saltfishforty, The Chair, The Wrigley Sisters and Gnoss, alongside local favourites including Hullion, the Kirkwall City Pipe Band # currently celebrating their centenary year # and many more. This amounts to an estimated  featured musicians # though many more will meet in Stromness, with the town’s pubs and hotels bursting with informal pub sessions from opening to closing time across the four days, alongside the ticketed programme. As well as Stromness, this year the festival reaches out to communities in Birsay, Burray, Finstown, Kirkwall, Orphir, Quoyloo, Sanday, Sandwick, St Margaret’s Hope, Stenness and Tankerness.In order to stage such a large event, the festival gratefully receives generous support from public bodies and corporate sponsors, from throughout the local and national business communities. This year’s principal supporters are Orkney Islands Council, Creative Scotland, NorthLink Ferries, Loganair — who also facilitated the rebooking of all those affected by the air traffic strike at zero cost, the Pier Arts Centre, and EIS, alongside many more inidual event sponsors and corporate patrons. The festival also benefits from many thousands of hours donated by hundreds of volunteers, who give their time freely to bring the world-renowned event together. From the twelve-strong year round management committee, to those who might work on just one event in their local community hall, each one of the festival’s community team is vital to its long standing, continued and increasing success.Festival director, Bob Gibbon said: “After many months of preparation we are delighted to be welcoming visitors and artists from far and wide, friends old and new, musicians from across the globe, to Orkney for what is set to be a memorable weekend of fun and good times. #Everyone has come together create a magnicent programme of events, and the festival just gets better and better. Orkney should rightly be very proud of what we can share, and this weekend is about sharing music, memories, time and happiness. Enjoy it everyone!”The festival’s chair, Elaine Grieve added: #I say this every year but I#m really excited about the programme for the weekend. There#s something for everyone fabulous visiting acts and a great number of local artists — and that#s something we really want to share with audiences. #It#s such a lovely time with many familiar faces ing and new joining the fold # a bit like a huge family reunion!#Alan Morrison, head of music at Creative Scotland said: “There are few places in Scotland with a more magical atmosphere than Orkney, where the stones of past civilisations sit alongside the buzz of the modern world. That’s also true of the Orkney Folk Festival, where the island’s heritage is woven into music being made by some of our best standard-bearers and rising stars. #It’s great to see so many brilliantly talented artists sharing a bill with musicians from far and near – andsome of them had to arrive a day early, well, that just means the sessions are already underway.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The final, which was held in Essex on Saturday, May , saw the finalists complete five tough physical challenges, as well as an interview with judges focusing on mental health.The competition was launched to promote mental and physical health in agriculture in a fun and engaging way.Mr Cursiter was announced as the men#s winner today, with -year-old Fiona Penfold, from the West Country, announced as the women#s winner.Asked about the importance of fitness to both mental and physical health, Sean said: #Farmers are constantly being required to produce cheap food while input costs rise. In Orkney there are a lot of farmers on their own, with  cows, living a lonely existence — they might not see another person for weeks.#He said that#s why he makes a conscious effort to socialise with others. Playing rugby for Orkney#s first team is a big part of this.#If folks close themselves in and just farm, then that#s not a good state of mind to be in. It#s hard to come away from the farm and be social, but it does have its benefits, and sometimes the lack of time is over-used as an excuse.##There are  hours in the day, so you need to give one to yourself.

When attracting talent in a fast-moving and constantly evolving sector like fintech, deep and detailed knowledge of market dynamics is absolutely essential.Edinburgh-based firm Carlyle, which has signicant experience of hiring senior iniduals for both the financial services and tech sectors, is the leading search and interim specialist in Scotland’s fintech space, and the firm understands the need for “intimate market knowledge”, as managing partner Carol-Ann Searles describes it. “We have been the go-to search partner for some time for a number of large financial services institutions in Scotland and further afield,” she says.“We also have great strength in technology, working with the likes of FreeAgent, ZoneFox [bought last year by cyber security giant Fortinet] and CodeClan. We worked closely with the board at CodeClan to secure Melinda Matthews-Clarkson as their new CEO, and we are currently in the process of recruiting a CEO to succeed Polly Purvis at tech trade body ScotlandIS.” Searles continues: “Because we have real strength in tech and financial services – from start-ups to big banks – we have a unique view across both environments.“Also, having built a firm reputation in Scotland over more than a decade, our London office is now providing a very effective talent bridge.“There is real interest from our clients in London-based talent  per cent of the people we are engaging with for senior roles in Scottish-headquartered businesses are in the London area, so it’s very important for our clients that we have a presence there.”Carlyle’s presence in the UK Capital could go some way to resolving one of the conundrums faced by fintech in Scotland – how to recruit the thousands of skilled people needed by the rapidly growing sector north of the Border.Carlyle’s founding partner Duggie Carlyle thinks that part of the answer could be “fintech figureheads” – high-profile and highly-skilled people who can attract talent pools around them.“The research done by industry bodies such as Scottish Financial Enterprise says we need thousands of new people in the next ten years,” he says. “It’s a real challenge, but what we have clearly observed is that by introducing one or two highly respected leaders into a geography, other talent inevitably follows. “Ten influential people could be the catalyst to attracting thousands more, which is why we feel our responsibility as a firm is much greater than simply recruiting for senior roles.”DataFiona James-Martin, a fellow Carlyle partner, agrees. “In the data age, we can more accurately track not only the number of senior placements, but their success,” she says. “We’re beginning to collect more data which shows that precision hiring, ensuring the right person in the right role at the right time, has signicant long-term effects on our clients’ businesses.” The erse skill sets required in fast-growth businesses are increasingly being provided by experienced figures who want to work in disruptive and fast-paced environments.Carlyle explains: “There are growing numbers of senior, highly skilled executives who want to work at an impactful level, but who don’t necessarily always want to undertake a permanent role. “Many have had successful executive careers but now choose to work in shorter-term engagements. Others have four or five consultancy assignments running at the same time. “These people are providing cross-fertilisation between financial services and technology, which is really valuable. One of the results of this is that large companies are increasingly supportive of their leadership teams having outside interests.”James-Martin adds: “We’ve seen numerous positive commercial outcomes when a large business brings in talent from a smaller and more nimble company, and vice versa.”The emergence of this group of skilled iniduals with a broader industry perspective– and a desire for complex challenges – is driving growth in Carlyle’s sector-leading interim practice.In a world where, in the words of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, “The pace of change has never been so fast, yet it will never be this slow again”, the speed of hiring talent can be make-or-break for a business. However, Carlyle provides a solution via its senior interim practice, which enables the short-term placement of experienced executives. “We responded to client need by developing a senior interim offering that can bring people in very quickly on a non-permanent basis,” says James-Martin. “Fast-moving businesses simply cannot wait six to nine months to get someone into a key role and large businesses are realising the opportunity cost of not having the right person in post right now. “We can also help address this through our trademarked Parallel Search offering, which enables us to recruit an interim inidual quickly while searching for a permanent solution.”James-Martin goes on to add that this challenge can be easier to overcome for small fintech businesses: “They are more agile, with less laborious processes, and can make faster decisions and faster hires.”Cross-fertilisation between young, agile fintechs and larger, established financial services institutions is maturing and Carlyle is seeing this across its three key business areas – its core executive search practice, interim practice and board practice. Duggie Carlyle believes there is a real opportunity for smaller fintechs to attract heavyweight senior talent, in both executive and non-executive roles.He says: “What a lot of smaller firms don’t realise is that,they have a strong business, they can attract some hugely experienced names on to their board who have decades of expertise in relevant sectors. “[Smaller firms] first instinct is that such iniduals would not be interested, but often these people want to give something back and do something dferent.“We can act as a conduit for scaling companies to engage with senior people who can make a substantial impact on their business. That’s the real value inherent in our knowledge and expertise across both financial services and technology.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit could change uk politics as we know it professor john curtice","story":"Could Brexit break the mould of British politics  That is central question facing politicians after the results of the European Parliament election were unveiled on Sunday night, writes Professor John Curtice.The two parties that are meant to dominate the country’s politics – the Conservatives and Labour – between them secured less than one in fourof all votes cast. This tally has never been anything like this low since the s when Labour displaced the Liberal Party as the principal opposition to the Conservatives.Of course, in Scotland, their dominance has long been eroded away. That was more than amply confirmed in the Euro-election by the fact that the Conservatives came fourth while Labour trailed in fth place. But in England and for the most part in Wales, their grip on Commons representation has seemed secure – until now.: Scottish Labour MPs slam leadership for EU vote failure: Jeremy Corbyn handed victory to Nigel FarageIn truth, voters do not behave in European elections in the same way they would in a general election. They tend to be more willing to cast a protest vote against the incumbent vote, to vote for smaller parties, and to support credible Eurosceptic parties. Last week’s ballot provided an environment in which a mass voter defection away from the two largest parties was most likely to occur.The Conservatives and Labour would not have fared so badly in a general election. Moreover, once a Euro-election is over, any surges of support during the campaign often seem to disappear as rapidly they arose.But this does not mean we can simply dismiss what happened last Thursday.For a start, this Euro-election might well not be forgotten as quickly as its predecessors. The issue that seems to have most influenced voters in deciding how to vote – Brexit – is not going to be forgotten very quickly. : EU election results: Blackford says SNPcements case for independence voteMeanwhile, more than one of the parties that would love to end the Conservative-Labour duopoly performed well. Not only did the Brexit Party come first, but the Liberal Democrats displaced Labour from second place, while the Greens overtook the Conservatives in the battle for fourth place.This is the first occasion when the duopoly south of the border has faced a two-pronged attack.

They were among the first pioneers in planting English and Scots settlers in Ireland. But by , Smiths settlement failed and the lands reverted to the crown.On  May , King James I granted the Ballymena Estate to another native Irish nobleman, Ruairiacute Oacuteg MacQuillan. The estate passed through several owners, eventually passing into the possession of William Adair, a Scottish laird from Kinhilt in southwestern Scotland.The estate was temporarily renamed Kinhiltstown after Adairs lands in Scotland. The original castle of Ballymena was built in the early th century, situated to take advantage of an ancient ford at the River Braid.In  Charles I confirmed the grant of the Ballymena Estate to William Adair, giving him the right to hold a market at Ballymena on every Saturday. He hired local Irish as workers on the estate they served as tenant farmers for much of the next two centuries and more.And from those early days, Ballymena became a commercial hub for central Co. Antrim, steadily growing in prosperity through the years of the linen boom in the th century.Until recent years, the traditional market had been held at the area known as the Fair Hill on lands bordered by upper Broughshane Street, William Street and Thomas Street.When the area was sold for the development of what is now the Fair Hill Shopping Centre, the Saturday market was moved to its current venue near the Seven Towers Leisure Centre.And that is pretty much where the whole tradition kicked off nearly  years ago as the site is pretty much right in the front garden of what used to be the Adair familys residence in Ballymena!Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is urging you to come enjoy, explore and love your local market this May as part of UK wide campaign to support our local traders. ‘Love Your Local Market’ runs from - May.

I can fully appreciate the impact that a cancer diagnosis can have on a family. “Thankfully, he has recovered well and has been participating in FROG for the past  years and fully intends to take part in FROG again this year,” he added. “FROG has grown tremendously since it began  years ago and now attracts over  cyclists. We are also building up the number of runners taking part, which is an exciting development.“A lot of preparation goes into organising FROG and the event runs like clockwork. “Organiser Paul McToal and his team deserve a tremendous amount of credit for the work they have put in over the past  years.

Farm attacks in South Africa are reported almost on a daily basis to the rest of the world and must be condemned. There is no denying they happen, the tragic results are plain to see. But what can be done about it  How does this affect how other farmers get on with le and their daily work I’ve been fortunate enough to visit and report from South Africa on five separate occasions now over the past  years and come away each time with a sense of dismissal but also hope.South Africa is a beautul country, physically, and produces some of the best food and wine demanded by consumers around the world.Politically, it’s a dferent place. A place where the state is not in charge. A state that cannot even control its basic power supply, without some form of corruption.But where does that leave agriculture and the farmers  No matter what political persuasion anyone holds, everyone must eat. Over the years of visiting farms in South Africa I noticed farmers becoming despondent, feeling let down, feeling a sense of ‘what’s the point of it all ’I’ve talked to farmers who were attacked, who lost loved ones, and who gave up.However, during my latest visit in early March this year I witnessed a positivity among farmers that really I never experienced before.Yes, nothing politically has changed, except for the worst, but farmers are more defiant, more ambitious and are investing to make their farms more efficient in order to give them a future.During the big livestock equipment show EuroTier in Germany last November I talked to a few South African farmers interested to see how technology could make their farms more efficient. It was really comforting to visit a number of farmers on this trip who are putting new technology to play in order to improve their businesses. Visiting Greenway Farms Ltd with headquarters at Tarlton to see how business partners Vito Rugani and Vincent Sequeira handle over , tonnes of carrots per year grown on , hectares was really inspiring.The passion and ambition shown by these leading vegetable farmers has resulted in a range of Rugani juices that are now being exported across the world. They have invested heavily in new state of the art equipment to extract juice from vegetables. The science is baffling, the set-up is extremely professional and as for the juice, well…..I have to admit this was the first time I ever tried carrot juice and it was absolutely delicious. The knowledge I gained from Vito and his team will stay with me for a long time. I just hope he finds a way to export the range to the UK!Next visit was to Corne Nel’s Doornfontein Melkery in Randfontein where they milk  cows. Dairy unit manager Pieter Barnard gave me a very informative tour around the farm.Having been brought up on a dairy farm myself in Northern Ireland this visit was particularly interesting and I was also impressed to see more investment in equipment to make le easier. A new rotary parlour installed two years ago certainly speeds milking time up and perhaps investment into robotic milkers will help too with the dferent milking groups in the future. The sun can be a challenge where livestock are concerned and it was good to hear plans to build new housing in the corals to keep the cows cooler. With excellent production figures and a sound understanding of the cows, this farm is certainly gearing up for an exciting future.Before travelling across the border to visit farms in Botswana I went to see Sarel Haasbroek’s grain farm in the Carletonville area of Gauteng. Again this is another progressive farmer positive about the future and was excelling in importing the Horsch machinery brand into South Africa. Up in Francistown, eastern Botswana, I was warmly hosted by the Munger family at Wayside Brahman Stud Ltd for four nights. During my stay there I was given a comprehensive run down of the breeding herd, commercial herd, game farm, and the egg laying enterprise. What a farm! Rowland and his son Rowly are certainly well respected in the area and for the cattle they produce. Wayside was started by Rowland’s father Keith who was also present during my visit. And then it was off to see another beef farmer, this time with Bonsmara cattle, Calla Visser, for a very early start checking his cattle. Every night Calla has to go and round up over  cattle on his farm and herd them into outdoor corals for the night to protect them against theft and predators such as hyenas or leopards!And, every next morning Calla and his staff start very early going around the five dferent corals on his , hectare farm counting all the cows, calves and bulls hoping they all made it through the night alive.This, of course, is a new line of management for me but was nonetheless interesting to learn. A visit to Bobbsies Chickens Ltd based in the east at Tshesebe guided by general manager Gerhard van der Merwe was another super visit. Botswana, too, impressed me, as did the farmers there. I received detailed insight into the beef and poultry industries there and look forward to the next time I can visit.Some of the Botswanans though need to learn how to drive!

Over the years my da became sole owner of the butchers, it was always called A’town Meats,” he said.Gerald said his father was the eldest of five children and that Tom’s three brothers and late sister all emigrated to Canada, with his father opting to stay in Ireland to raise his young family.“At one stage he had opened up a butchers shop in Poleglass, inside a group of shops at the time and a shop in Ladybrook which my brother Vincent ran. Dad sold the business in September  and stayed on because it was coming up to Christmas, up to the Christmas club and what is a very busy time. After Christmas he stayed on, right up until around March, April time when he started to feel unwell. He was told it was cancer and started radiotherapy in October last year.”Gerald continued: “The Christmas period was very bad as he was very anxious waiting on results following the treatment. It wasn’t that he got the all clear, but he was told everything seemed ‘positive’. He knew by the end of January, early February something wasn’t right, the pain started coming back and he was told that ‘it’ was back.“A week or so later he was told that it was terminal.”“He was in hospital about a fortnight and we took him out to bring him home. He was only out three weeks and one day when he passed away.”Gerald spoke poignantly of how A’town Meats was known as a “meeting place, a place for people to come and talk”.“People would come in for a yarn, for many it was their way of getting out of the house and a chance for conversation.”Gerald said his father was a founding member of the Donegal Celtic Football Club and loved the GAA, especially local clubs Lamh Dhéarg and Rossa.“Last year was the best year of his le as he got closer to his kids. He was always working. His kids, his grandkids,you wanted to go see him you went to the shop. Eventhe children were being baptised, made their communions, their confirmations, you brought them to the shop. He was there six-days a week. I would have seen him on Christmas Day going into the shop and getting burgers, getting whatever was needed for restaurants who would’ve contacted him needing food. He went round, opened up and made sure they were catered for.”As well as a prominent businessman, Gerald said his father was a “bookmaker as well”.“He applied his trade at Celtic Park, Drumbo, Dundalk and Dunmore, it was a hobby as much as anything . He loved to see people winning.”He added: “One of the first times he ever done the book, a fella ended up owing him over £, and he said he would have it up to the shop that Tuesday. When the guy came up to the shop, my da was still meeting and greeting the customers, they came first, they were the be all and end all.“Dad gave the man a large meat parcel and said to him ‘take that down to the house with you’. The fella said it was the first time he had owed someone money, paid it and actually left ‘with a smile on his face’. The fella brought it down to his family and they were saying how nice the meat was and he replied: ‘Well of course it is, it cost me £,!’”Gerald said his father could pick up on when his customers were going through hardship.“He knew without them having to say anything. He would give them some food just to help them out, he never spoke of it, it was the people who would come in and tell you how he had helped.“A wee woman came into the shop one Christmas and she couldn’t afford the turkey so she said she was just going to take a ‘wee chicken this year’ and offered a ring as a means of payment. He wouldn’t hear of it but the wee woman insisted on giving over the ring. The wee woman passed away and her daughters came into the shop months later and he said he had something belonging to them and brought out the ring.“He was a very private man and religious in his own ways. He would’ve walked from his house in Donegall Park to Clonard, walked down for the Rosary and to St Paul’s as well. He always kept himself fit, he did Slimming World in his ’s and went out of his way to get the accreditation to sell the Slimming World endorsed food in the shop.

It’s like getting a record out again, all you have to do is just dust it down a bit.”Terry stressed that their Harmony Live performance, along with Irish duo Aslan and The  Of Us, definitely won’t be their last following speculation that circulated at the start of .“We didn’t say anything about final shows, I’ve actually discovered how this happened and it’s usually the venue or the agent who come out with the story. The next thing I was doing a radio interview with Johnny Hero and he was asking ‘is this going to be your last show ’ I said, ‘Johnny I don’t know, it was out of my hands’. Even when you deny it, it appears in the papers as well, but it’s not the case,” he said.Terry spoke of how nowadays outdoor festival gigs are planned to within an inch of their le – unlike back in the ’s.“Back in the day the first thing you did when you arrived at an open air thing, was the itinerary would be on the door, first thing you’d do is take it down as it had no resemblance to reality because everything then would run half an hour, to an hour late.”With the Spice Girls set to appear at Croke Park this weekend, Elton John taking two years to complete his ‘farewell’ tour and a Let’s Rock ’s festival set to set out its stall this summer in Boucher Road, Terry spoke of how nostalgia is a “new aspect” of the rock ‘n’ roll industry.“There is a big nostalgia industry, people who might have bought a record of ours when they were teenagers are now in their ’s. People want to go out and see what they spent their money on in their youths. Nostalgia is not part of the rock ‘n’ roll business, it’s a new aspect. Now rock ‘n’ roll is old enough to be nostalgic. It’s good for us, it’s good for everybody who was around at that time.”As the band fine tune their set list, Terry said that he along with songwriter Pat Gribben have been talking about making “another record”.“We’ll see,there is a demand there. We have talked about it.”A limited number of tickets for Harmony Live are still available. Tickets for the Friday May  line-up which includes Aslan, The Adventures and The  Of Us are priced at £..

The couple has moved there after the loss of the family home, Belle Reve, to creditors. Stanley’s suppressed rage at his lot in le finds an outlet when Blanche turns up.Through “nips of whiskey”, “sips of Bourbon” and card games, Blanche’s dreamy posturing and posingcollides head-on with Stanley’s rage and the anger boils over as the play reaches its brutal, violent climax.The production is spot on in its timing, debuting as the fall-out from the#MeToo campaign around the abuse of women continues to gather pace. Key contemporary issues of PTSD, mental health and gender equality are brought into sharp and devastating focus and we are forced to confront the question of how much –anything – has changed in  years.Emma Jordan’s sure-footed direction, Ciaran Bagnall’s atmospheric set and lighting design, Enda Kenny’s exquisite costume design and Carl Kennedy’s sound design interweave to bring us an utterly convincing sense of place and mood and combine with an absolutely outstanding cast to make this production the best I have ever seen at the Lyric.The audience were on their feet at the end to gave a well-deserved standing ovation to all involved in a play that will stay with you for a long time to come.A must-see.

However, the stadium could be used as a training base.The Casement Park report, which appeared in yesterdays Sunday Times, would appear to pour cold water over plans which emerged earlier this year for a new football stadium to be constructed here as part of the bid.The DfC told the Sunday Times that Casement Park was central to the proposed bid, expected to be made later this year.\"The English FA, FA of Wales, Irish FA, Scottish FA and FA of Ireland are all in discussions about the feasibility of bidding to be the European candidate to host the  FIFA World Cup,\" it said. \"The governments of the UK, Republic of Ireland, and the devolved administrations are all active participants in those discussions.

three-way battle for the third seat on the plane to Brussels, but it quickly became a foregone conclusion..pushExpected front runners Martina Andersonand Diane Doddspolled as well as expected from the outset, but within an hour of the am count starting in Magherafelt it was clear another story was emerging.Pile after pile of votes were allocated to Naomi Long and the eyebrows of even the most hardened election pundit, who may already have had the Alliance Party leader doing enough to take the third seat from the Ulster Unionists, were starting to rise at the scale of the achievement.Alliance veteran and former leader David Ford stood quietly and watched, his smile growing wider with each pile of ballot papers moving in Mrs Longs direction.Even at that early stage Mr Ford could sense something momentous was happening on the political scene.\"Its a sign of what weve seen in both European and council elections across the UK,\" he said early in the day. \"People are voting for parties which have a definite policy on Europe.\"Weve been building momentum these last few years with solid results across Northern Ireland.\"\"Were having another good day so far and well have a good evening too. \"Im smiling quite a lot.\"A nod of acknowledgment from DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson signied that the race for the third seat was almost over before it had begun. \"In fairness to the Alliance Party, they have a clear message and have done well,\" he said.Very quickly, a first preference vote of over , looked inevitable, and so it proved.Where there are winners, so there are losers, and the biggest on the day was the Ulster Unionist Party as veteran Danny Kennedy was swept away by the Alliance surge.He was the first of the big guns to fall, in just the second count, as his bid to replace long-standing party MEP Jim Nicholson fell flat.As he conceded it had been a disappointing day, the result appearing to herald the end of Mr Kennedys political career.\"Its fair to say my days as an elected representative seem to be numbered,\" he admitted.Dignied in defeat at the polls, party leader Robin Swann remained defiant that no obituaries should be written for his party yet. \"The Ulster Unionist Party isnt going away,\" he insisted. \"We know that narrative is already being put out there, but were here to stay for a lot more elections to come.\"SDLP leader Colum Eastwood hung in a bit longer, remaining low-key, although the writing was on the wall from near the outset.\"If unionist votes werent going to the UUP, they werent going to go to us,\" he admitted.In the end no one was going to get close to ruining Mrs Longs day and the expected three-way battle for the third seat became a one-horse race as two of the contenders barely got out of the starting gate.While DUP leader Arlene Fosters wish for two unionist seats to be delivered didnt materialise, she still made the point that not much has changed.\"The UUPs Jim Nicholson voted as a Remainer so in that respect we still have two Remainers and one Leave in Europe,\" she said.The problem for unionism, however, is that the Remainer in question now is the Alliance Party leader.Sinn Fein and the DUP will both claim victories, one topping the poll and one first to be deemed elected, but the real winner on the day was a triumphant Naomi

The parties are currently engaged in talks attempting to restore devolved government with civil servants responsible for running the country.Asked about her message to the local politicians, Baroness Paisley said they needed to \"lay aside their baggage and face facts\".\"So many petty things, they dont see the big picture,\" she said.\"So many people are crying out for help and they are failing them by not taking responsibility.\"It is going to get worse and that leaves us open to all sorts of trouble.\"She added: \"I would say to them cut out the petty things and dwell on things that matter - think of the people.She said she was \"aggrieved\" the  MLAs were still taking a salary and it was not fair on civil servants to be doing the job of elected representatives.\"It is abominable for people to take money for nothing,\" she added, \"they are not doing the job they were elected to do.\"Baroness Paisley also said the parties needed to be more open with the public, adding: \"There is nothing in the open, what goes on is hidden.\"We are all sinners no matter who we are or what we are.She was asked about the DUP fielding its first openly gay candidate, Alison Benningtion and the subsequent resignations from the party after her successful election, including her late husbands brother in law and how some have said the late Ian Paisley would be \"turning in his grave\".\"We are all sinners no matter who we are or what we are.. that girl may not know Christ died for her,\" she said.\"I do not hate Ms Bennington, I dont know the girl. I dont hate anybody no matter who they are or what they have done against me.\"But we have to love Christ first and what He says we have to obey his word. These things are written for our benefit.\"Baroness Paisley said she hoped the party was not making a move away from the ethos her husband established the party under.\"It was a decision taken at the time and I think it was taken as a defiance to see what would happen.\"And I think it should be put to the whole party and a proper decision made on what should be done.\"Turning to Brexit and Arlene Fosters comments on leaving the countrya united Ireland came about, Eileen Paisley said it would take an \"awful lot\" for her to move saying so long as their was freedom of religion she would remain.\"I would not like a dictatorship or someone whatever their religion was to be persecuted because of that.\"It is a big question. If we go right back to the beginning, the iding of Ireland. The people or Ireland, north, south, east and west, I think are a great people.\"No matter what part of Ireland a person is from.. they are a fellow country man or woman.\"I just wonder why it had to be ided at that time and I think that was the wrong ision. It is too big an issue for me to ponticate on.\" I dont want my mind and soul to be poisoned with an unforgiving spirit.Baroness Paisley said she missed her late husband more, and more every day and she was told many times by others across the political ide and the communities his leadership was missed.She recalled how her husband wanted to be a farmer when he was a young boy and it was when sowing corn he heard the call from God that it was not he seed He wanted Ian to sow.She said in his first sermon in Sixmilecross in Co Tyrone he spoke for only  minutes before running out of material and immediately vowed to never speak again.\"And the man that was taking him told him youll speak all right, and so his words were fulfilled,\" she said.In his final years the Free Presbyterian Church ostracised its founder. Baroness Bannside said it was \"very callous\" but pointed to Jesus and how despite all he had done for his people, was crucied.Baroness Bannside said she no longer worships at the Free Presbyterian Church as it would \"leave her open\" instead going to her granddaughters husbands baptist church.\"I just put it away, I dont bother... I live my own live with my own family and I am content to do that,\" she added.\"It was dficult to forgive them but I have to get on. I have to go on, I dont want my mind and soul to be poisoned with an unforgiving spirit."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38153649.ece/4661f/AUTOCROP/w65square/0519JP1EUcount070.jpg","title":"2019 eu elections live results for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

These are heady days for Naomi Longs Alliance Party..pushThe implications are potentially profound, for Brexit and a border poll. Most Northern Ireland voters voted Remain in , have backed Remain parties since, elected two Remain candidates at this election and support the backstopthey cannot stay in the EU. So good luck to the next Conservative leader explaining to Brussels why it is in Northern Irelands best interests that a Withdrawal Agreement signed off across all member states be renegotiated. Barnier will bin Boris, not the backstop. Then the Conservative government may have the stark choice between a plea for another delay to departure - which party leadership candidates are ruling out - or leave the EU with no deal. And the DUP will inhibit any backsliding from a new Conservative leader who, like the outgoing one, concedes that there really is no alternative to the backstop.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetAlliance surge Phase  wont sht the DUP. Its vote share rose again, with Diane Dodds cantering home. Meanwhile, the UUP is now bereft of representation everywhere except on local councils. Given that most Northern Ireland voters want to remain in the EU, the logic of the UUP in switching sides to supporting leave was questionable. This was another very weak election performance. The unionist leave-the-EU market was already a crowded marketplace in which it made little sense to jostle with the DUP and TUV bruisers. Having cautioned in  against Brexit on the grounds of economic damage, the UUP now advocated its implementation on the basis of popular UK sovereignty - which is not the easiest canvass. A personable candidate like Danny Kennedy was always up against it taking on the committed Brexit true believers. Does this result hasten a possible referendum beyond Brexit - a border poll  In this European contest, % of voters backed unionist parties, % backed nationalist organisations and % backed others. Thats nowhere near dramatic enough for the Secretary of State to fire the starting pistol, but it does indicate that a border poll,ever called, is not quite a foregone conclusion for the unionist cause. To be safe, unionists would have to attract the backing of at least one-third of those supporting Alliance or the Greens - and many of those supporters are utterly alienated by Brexit and its backers. Otherwise, unionists might need Seamus Mallon to do the counting. Alliances success also brings into question the political structures which have so prioritised unionism and nationalism within the Assembly. Parallel consent rules framed around those two minority identities - when the largest category of people, albeit not among those bothering to vote, say they are neither, may need revisiting. Northern Irelands party system is changing, with single big parties dominating the right, left and, finally, the centre. Brexit continues to transform politics - and we are far from done yet.

In the end, it was anything but close as Naomi Long coasted home with a vote twice as big as the Ulster Unionists and almost , ahead of the SDLP..pushAnd she even managed to be elected second, with transfers bringing her in almost , votes ahead of Sinn Fein.Alliance entered the council election hoping to break through the magic % barrier. Never could it have imagined three weeks later that it would secure a staggering % vote, the highest ever since its formation almost half a century ago.The person who has made it all possible is Naomi Long.Before her leadership, the party was seen as worthy but dull - dominated by do-gooders who, no matter how well-meaning, would bore you to death. Long has impressively rebranded Alliance and brought passion and fire to the middle ground.The party is now facing a problem caused by its own success - it is losing its greatest asset to Brussels. Mrs Long will have to resign as an MLA with another member co-opted into her seat.While Alliance has very competent performers in its Stormont ranks, none possess its leaders star quality.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetAlthough it goes entirely against its ideological grain, a speedy Brexit which sees Mrs Long home by the end of the year and back in the front-line in a restored Assembly would be no bad thing for the party.Once Brussels was a place for the men in grey suits but for the first time ever Northern Ireland ed three female MEPs.The election was an absolute disaster for the Ulster Unionists, with Danny Kennedy losing their seat. The party was in trouble when Mike Nesbitt resigned as leader in . It had two MPs, an MEP, and  councillors then.Now, it has no representation in Westminster or Brussels and  councillors - reduced to just two membersin the Belfast City Hall it ran in its heyday.It lagged in sixth yesterday, behind the TUV. Its EU campaign unfortunately summed up the party - lacklustre and with no clear message.It is almost impossible to see the UUP becoming competitive again. It has oftencomplained that elections here are just sectarian headcounts which favour the two big beasts. Yet this months council and EU polls were far less that than any others in recent decades, and the UUP still lost signicant ground.Robin Swann cant be blamed for the problems his party is facing because he inherited them. The UUP shied away from taking bold decisions about its political direction in , preferring just to stick with the old familiar, failing approach.But it seems apparent that Mr Swann has no clear road map for the way ahead. Indeed, one likely doesnt exist. Traditional unionists will continue to stick with the DUP, liberal ones wont be leaving Alliance now. Despite two poor elections, he is unlikely to be challenged for the leadership because nobody in their right mind would want it.It was a good election for the DUP. Diane Dodds reduced Sinn Feins lead from , to , votes and was elected two counts ahead of Martina Anderson. Mrs Dodds has never had the spectacular victories that her predecessors, Rev Ian Paisley and Jim Allister, enjoyed. Yet she still increased the vote and her party will be well pleased with the result.The sharpest minds in the DUP realise that the biggest threat to it in future isnt from a disorganised, dwindling UUP, but from a youthful, energetic, hard-working and well organised Alliance Party.They realise that unionists, especially young ones, do increasingly vote Alliance and that constantly bashing the party as crypto Provos just wont wash.Expect those in the DUP who favour a more secular and liberal approach to make their voices heard internally over the next few months.Coming in comfortably ahead of the UUP was a very good result for Mr Allister who may have initially regretted running for Europe after the TUVs council results. He clearly still has a real future in politics here, although his party is destined to remain largely a one-man band.It wasnt a bad election for Colum Eastwood who managed to finally halt the SDLPs terminal decline and actually increased its vote, albeit by .%.Yet disappointment was written all over its leaders faces yesterday. They genuinely expected to be in the running for the last seat and will be concerned at Alliance overtaking them to emerge as the third largest party in the poll. By common agreement across the political spectrum, Mr Eastwood ran the best campaign of all the candidates. Yet the message from the result has to be that, unlike Mrs Long, his personal appeal is not greater than his partys.Martina Anderson may have topped the poll but dont be fooled into thinking it was a good day here for Sinn Fein whose vote was down %. The party is losing votes to Alliance and the Greensin middle-class areas while under pressure from People Before Profit and independent republicans in working-class areas. It will now be keener to restore devolution.In the Republic, Sinn Feins council vote decreased by a third to just under % and its likely to lose an MEP. The shine is rapidly coming off Mary Lou McDonalds leadership and expect Gerry Adams to start popping up more in an effort to reassure the base. Further reversals in a Dail election would put the Sinn Fein president on very dodgy territory indeed."},{"url":null,"title":"tom kelly naomi long is proving popular as voters long for change","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Naomi Long is a tenacious advocate for liberalism and the middle ground. Northern Ireland voters seem to like the cut of her jib..pushThe Alliance EU campaign, like the local government one, was a continuation of the presidential-style investment in the cult of their leader. And it works.In particular, for those tens of thousands of pro-European unionist voters who were all but abandoned by the mainstream unionist parties, who saw a new political home provided by Naomi and Alliance.Naomis performance means she could be in co-pole position with Claire Hanna of the SDLP to take a Westminster seat from the DUP - but with the caveat that she cant hog all her partys opportunities. But May  is like having a second birthday and only a curmudgeon wouldnt wish her well.So Northern Ireland now has three female MEPs, but with the exception that two of the three MEPs are now solidly pro-European.Under the current demographics, the expectation of two nationalist pro-European parties going to Brussels was too big an ask. Northern Ireland isnt quite ready for that amount of change.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetThe DUP have now played runner-up to Sinn Fein in a third European election - though the margin is by much less. The DUP, TUV and Ukip have lost tens of thousands of votes since the last EU elections. Diane Dodds remains the DUP standard-bearer, solid and dependable, though the voting highs of both Ian Paisley and Jim Allister are now well beyond her reach. Dodds can be content with being the first to hit the quota on transfers.However, the big losers are the Ulster Unionists - neither fish nor fowl under the leadership of the hapless, but nice Robin Swann, the party have finally plummeted to new lows.Swann has not cut any clear path for his party. His instincts to do the right thing are often undermined by his near-hypnotic behaviour to ape the DUP.The party need a new leader - a Nesbitt-type leader who understands pluralism and appeals to younger voters. Robin Swann is the political equivalent of Coronation Streets Norris Cole.Danny Kennedy was placed in an impossible position, as a border unionist who supported Remain, but had to defend the ridiculous pro-Brexit position of his party grandees.The SDLP campaign team will be disappointed by the strong performance of Naomi Long, but should not be too despondent.Colum Eastwoodran a positive and energetic campaign - the best the SDLP have had in years. The SDLP percentage of the vote increased from the local government elections and the wider voter haemorrhaging seems to have been cauterised.There was also clear evidence that Sinn Fein opted for a deliberate tactical policy of encouraging transfers to Alliance over the SDLP as a way of limiting any surge in the nationalist vote - a first for Sinn Fein since .The SDLP leader has proven his party isnt going away and, unlike Robin Swann, his voter base is not deserting him.Martina Anderson, the Sinn Fein MEP, has given a solid performance for her party against a calamitous election in the Republic of Ireland. That said, the Sinn Fein EU vote is down by .% in Northern Ireland from the last EU election, which in voting terms is just under a whopping , voters who have either stayed at home, or opted for an alternative.No party can seriously have a strategy which purposefully reduces their share of the vote. Anderson is, though, comfortably ahead of Dodds in topping the poll.The DUP versus Sinn Fein tussle is a long way off the gladiatorial contests between the DUPs Ian Paisley and the SDLPs John Hume, who in their last outing against each other got a staggering , and , first preference votes respectively.That Sinn Fein dropped over three percentage points in Northern Ireland is signicant, because they appeared to have nationalist voters in a semi-permanent electoral lockdown since .Sinn Fein are at their electoral best when agitating and Brexit in some ways preserved their base in Northern Ireland in a way that it couldnt in the Republic.Mary Lou, the Sinn Fein president, is making no great shakes of her leadership the presidential election results, along with the local government and EU results, show that Sinn Fein under her are on the slide. In , they secured an impressive % of the vote in the Republic today its just over %.Sinn Feins vice-president, Michelle ONeill , has been sheltered from the voting collapse because of the dominance of identity politics over issues and policies within the north.The uncompromising attitude of the DUP towards all things Irish also shores up Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland. That said, the Sinn Fein leadership have some serious thinking to do - something acknowledged by senior TDs. The invincibility of Sinn Fein has been pierced and it is not going to be contained at the border for much longer. Sinn Fein cant cope with a buoyant Irish economy and record levels of employment.Its hard to believe they couldnt politically capitalise on the housing crisis in Dublin. They are being challenged in Dublin working-class areas by a resurgent Fianna Fail and now the Greens.Independents and People Before Profit are to the left of them. Even in West Belfast and Derry, People Before Profit are proving better street agitators than Sinn Fein.In Northern Ireland, a Sinn Fein supporter informed this writer that former senior republicans had told him that they would prefer to support Alliance over the SDLP, because of the SDLPs decision to abstain on the Spad Bill taken to the Assembly by TUV leader Jim Allister in .If true, this would be ironic, as it was Alliance voting with the other unionist parties that delivered the Bill and it was the Greens who voted with Sinn Fein against it. It would seem some in Sinn Feins old guard cant rise above grudge revenge politics even within the wider nationalist family.With the revolutionary days over and the smell of sulphur a distant memory, Sinn Fein need to find a new purpose and champion issues beyond the politics of protest. It remains to be seenthat can be delivered by the current duo. But, north and south, change is definitely a-coming and parties should be prepared to be blown along with the change, or be swept away.Tom Kelly is a writer and commentator"},{"url":null,"title":"day of waiting at midlands north west as no second seat announced","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Where the liquid had hit, the mother reported her daughters skin was gone and blisters were forming in other areas and the child was crying.Upon landing in Krakow the girl was airlted to hospital and was then transferred to Toronto, Canada where she spent eight days being treated as an outpatient for her burns before ing home to Calornia.Sriya Venkata Neti, who is now  years old, and lives in Freemont, Calornia had through her father Srinivas Neti sued Ryanair over the accident on the Rome Krakow flight on June , .She had claimed she had been served a hot chocolate at such a high temperatures that the liquid could and did cause severe scalding and burns to her and there was an alleged failure to provide a safe method of service of hot beverages in particular hot chocolate suitable for minors.It was further claimed there was an alleged failure to warn the little girl of the known danger posed by the temperatures at the which the chocolate was served.It was also alleged there was an alleged failure to provide any or any adequate assistance to the child and her family post spillage and that after a time it was allegedly requested the little girl be moved to a toilet for treatment so as not to disturb other passengers.The alleged failure of the cabin crew it was claimed to prove any adequate assistance to the girl or her parents allegedly resulted in the burns suffered being exacerbated.In particular, it was claimed the alleged failure to provide any or any adequate means of cooling the burns worsened the injuries considerably.Ryanair denied all the claims.The girls counsel Hugh Mohan SC told the court it was a slightly unusual case in that  under the Warsaw Conventiona passenger on an international flight can show that bodily injuries were caused by an accident, an unexpected or unusual event that is external to the passenger, then the passenger need not show negligence or fault as against the airline.The young girl suffered burns to her thighs and buttocks and has been left with scarring, the court heard.In an affidavit to the court, the girls father Srinivas Neti said the scarring has now substantially improved and whereas the injuries sustained were extremely serious, his daughter has made a good recovery and the condition of her injuries has improved considerably.Approving the settlement Mr Justice Kevin Cross said when Sriya was scalded it must have been extremely painful. The young girl has also been left with scarring but the court heard she has made a good recovery. He also took in to account that the family now wanted to get on with their lives and to put the incident behind them."},{"url":null,"title":"ireland and france seek funding for joint postbrexit energy scheme","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I think the best way to do that is with a deal,” she said.“But it will be for my successor and for Parliament to find a way forward and get a consensus.”The comments are aimed at Brexiteers in the race to replace her who have said they are prepared to back a no-deal departure from the EU, something which could lead to a clash with Parliament.Mr Hunt warned rivals that calling a general election – potentially to win a mandate for a no-deal Brexit – could be a disaster for the Tories, insisting that the UK’s exit from the EU must be completed before going to the polls.Setting out the scale of the challenge facing the Tories, Mr Hunt told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “We must not go back to the electorate asking for their mandate until we’ve delivered what we promised we would do last time, which is to deliver Brexit, it would be absolutely catastrophic for us as a party.”Mr Hunt, who campaigned for Remain in the  referendum but has adopted an increasingly Eurosceptic tone, said he had “always believed we should keep no deal on the table” as it is the “best way of getting a good deal”.Mr Hunt said it was important to “find a dferent way to get a deal”, adding “we have to have a go at this” as he proposed forming a new wider negotiating team to change the Withdrawal Agreement.Leadership rival Dominic Raab also said he was focused on “getting a fairer deal from the EU as we leave”.But outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker stressed “there will be no renegotiation”.The agreement between the EU and Mrs May to delay Brexit until October  included a commitment not to seek a renegotiation of the deal.A team of DUP, ERG, Scottish  Welsh representatives would be Foreign Sec @Jeremy_Hunts plan for renegotiating a Brexit deal with the EU. \"It would

Leavers and Remainers behind a compromise Brexit plan earlier this year, said he had a “good number” of MPs backing his bid.“We’ve got to find a way to unite the Conservative Party to deliver a Brexit plan so we can move onto a really compelling, attractive domestic agenda that might command victory at a general election,” Mr Malthouse told the Press Association.“One of the reasons that I’m running is that I’m the only person who has actually done that.”Mr Malthouse served as a deputy mayor of London under leadership campaign frontrunner Boris Johnson.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Housing

having a clean break from the EU and not leaving on October .”Other Tory MPs vying for the top job include Cabinet colleagues Sajid Javid Andrea Leadsom and Rory Stewart, who continued his series of campaign walkabouts.Speculation continued to surround the prospect of other contenders emerging, including Brexit Minister James Cleverly, Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt and former  Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady.Meanwhile, Downing Street indicated that the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which led to Mrs Leadsom’s resignation and the Cabinet revolt that hastened Mrs May’s departure, might

They are required to have a doctors’ note deeming them physically fit, but not to prove their stamina at such extreme heights.Because of the altitude, climbers have just hours to reach the top before they are at risk of a pulmonary oedema, when the lungs fill with liquid. From Camp Four at , metresto the ,-metrepeak, the final push on Everest is known as the “death zone”.The conditions are so intense at such times that when a person dies, no-one can afford to expend energy on carrying the body down from the mountain.“Every minute counts there,” said Eric Murphy, a mountain guide from Bellingham, Washington, who climbed Everest for a third time on May . He said what should have taken  hours took  hours because of struggling climbers who were clearly exhausted but had no-one to guide or help them.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Eric Murphy Just a handful of inexperienced climbers, he said, is “enough to have a profound effect”.Nepal does not have any regulations on the books to determine how many permits should be issued, so anyone with a doctor’s note can obtain one for an , dollarfee, said Mohan Krishna Sapkota, secretary at the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation.This year, permits were issued to  people, the highest number ever, according to the government. They were accompanied by an equal number of guides from Nepal’s ethnic Sherpa community. Some climbers were originally issued permits in  that were revoked mid-season when  Sherpa guides died in an avalanche and other Sherpas, whose support as guides and porters is essential, effectively went on strike.Another factor was China’s limit on the number of permits it issued for routes in its territory on the north side of Everest this year for a clean-up. Both the north and south sides of the mountain are littered with empty oxygen canisters, food packaging and other debris.Instead of the overcrowding, Mr Sapkota blamed the weather, equipment and inadequate supplemental oxygen for this year’s deaths.“There has been concern about the number of climbers on Mount Everest but it is not because of the traffic jam that there were casualties,” Mr Sapkota said in Namche, the town that serves as the staging area for Everest trips.But he said: “In the next season, we will work to have double rope in the area below the summit so there is better management of the flow of climbers.”Instead of limiting the number of people who attempt to reach Everest’s peak, Mr Saptoka said Nepal’s government will encourage even more tourists and climbers to come “for both pleasure and fame”.Mirza Ali, a Pakistani mountaineer and tour company owner who reached Everest’s peak for the first time this month, on his fourth attempt, said such an approach was flawed.“Everybody wants to stand on top of the world” but tourists unprepared for the extremes of Everest endanger the entire industry, he said.“There is not a sufficient check on issuing the permits,” Mr Ali said. “The more people come, the more permits, more business. But on the other side, it is a lot of risk because it is costing lives.”Indian climber Ameesha Chauhan, recovering from frostbitten toes at a hospital in Kathmandu, described the agony of turning away from the peak when she realised her supplemental oxygen supply was low.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Ameesha Chauhan gets treatment in hospital after she was rescued in Kathmandu Two of her team members died on the May  ascent.She ed and scaled the peak a week later.“Many climbers are too focused on reaching the summit,” she said. “They are not only risking themselves but also putting others at risk.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ramadan means fasting and facebook for many in middle east data shows","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Many also work shorter hours during the day.All that translates to % more time spent on Facebook’s s, or what is nearly  million more hours, Mr Shehadi said. Put another way, there are almost two million hours of additional time spent daily on Facebook in the Middle East during Ramadan.Ramadan is also the peak season for advertising in the region, as TV dramas and soap operas get a % increase in viewership on YouTube during the holy month, according to Google.“Our revenue is aof people’s engagement,” Mr Shehadi said. “The more that they engage on our s, the more that advertisers want to be able to reach those that are engaging. That’s what drives our revenue.”So much ad revenue is spent during Ramadan that Google launched The Lantern Award to celebrate the most creative and engaging ads of the month.Yet Ramadan is not just about abstaining from food and drink, including water, during the day. It is also about disconnecting from vacuous distractions and focusing on contemplation, introspection, acts of good, charity and connecting with God.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A woman looks at a Ramadan-related page on her mobile phone in Dubai It can appear then as a contradiction that this is also when companies ramp up their efforts to get people to buy more, view more and engage in excess consumerism.Google does not disclose total watch time for YouTube during Ramadan, but says that in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, for example, viewing of sports videos jumps by %, travel videos by %, and action games, simulation and video games by -% during the holy month.People also spend % more time watching religious content on YouTube in Ramadan.“To us, YouTube brings people together. We see a lot of people wanting to watch things together,” said Joyce Baz, Google’s head of communications in the Middle East and North Africa.She added that Google products, such as its search engine, are there “to simply people’s lives so that they can focus on things that matter, like being with their loved ones and family”.Google’s Qibla Finder, for example, helps Muslims find the direction of Mecca to pray towards, wherever they happen to be.Google says this year’s top trending search queries during the first week of Ramadan in Egypt, Iraq and Saudi Arabia included a surprising mix of Game Of Thrones, prayer times, Ramadan TV shows, film timings and English Premier League results.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A Muslim man reads verses of the Koran Meanwhile, some of the most popular downloaded apps in the Middle East on the Google Play store during Ramadan include games such as Stack Ball, streaming apps like Vu and Shahid and online retailers Noon and Jolly Chic.Iftar evening meals are a major social affair during Ramadan, ranging from lavish spreads at home to decadent five-star hotel buffets. This translates into a % spike in beauty product searches and an % spike in searches for beauty tips on YouTube, compared with the rest of the year. Also, according to Google maps, trips to shopping centres increase by more than % in the last weeks of Ramadan in preparation for the Eid al-Fitr holiday, which ends the holy month.Fatima el-Barbar, an Egyptian mother living in Dubai, said she searches more for recipes and watches her favourite TV dramas online during Ramadan. But she said that between her job, taking care of the children, preparing tar each night, her daily prayers and reading the Koran, the Muslim holy book, there is little time for the internet.“I actually have less time for the internet in Ramadan than in other days of the year,” she said.To help companies better understand consumer habits in Ramadan, Google identied six categories of audiences: dedicated watchers, devoted fasters, foodies, groomers, travellers and shoppers.“YouTube is a companion during Ramadan, a  where viewers can watch what they want, whenever they want throughout the day,” Google says in its own pitch to advertisers.To more authentically connect with roughly  million users in the Middle East, Facebook and Instagram launch special Ramadan icons to give people more customised ways of expressing themselves online. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A woman uses her mobile phone at the Facebook office in Dubai, United Arab Emirates Instagram also has a campaign to promote acts of kindness during the month.“We’re trying to be magniers and propagators of goodness as opposed to what might seem on the surface like an extension of consumerism,” Mr Shehadi said. “It resonates with the ethos of Ramadan and certainly the ethos of Facebook, which is around bringing people together around things that matter to them.”Haitham el-Ghoneim, a Jordanian resident in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, said he uses Facebook to connect with friends during Ramadan, sharing traditional greetings for the holy month and checking on his family in Jordan.But he does not think the rest of it – all that time spent online, on games, scrolling and ads – is a good thing. “It’s not being spent in a useful way. It’s mostly fake news, or jokes and things that have no benefit,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"derry tourism service industry blasted poverty wages","story":"Businesses within the tourism and service industries in Derry have been strongly criticised for paying staff “poverty wages” despite a recent upsurge in visitors.The comments were made by the Derry Trades Union Councilwhich met with delegates from the Aegis union and representatives from the Low Pay Commissionin the city.The DTUC has called on the local tourism and services sector to justy its low pay policy which is forcing families to foodbanks and leaving greater numbers in poverty.Last year leading accountancy firm, ASM Chartered Accountants, published a bellwether report on the tourism industry in NI which described Derry as the “star of the show”.It said the city had turned a corner through growing occupancy rates which brought about improved profitability of .% in  compared to .% in .With that increase in demand came a very substantial improvement in room rates which increased by .% year on year to an overall average of £..A record number of cruise ships are also set to dock in the city this year, according to Visit Derry.Commenting after the meeting on the need to hold large employers to account, Aegis Divisional Secretary, Gareth Moore, said: \"We welcome the visit from the LPC and the opportunity to highlight the damage that poverty wages has on workers, their families and their communities.“In the current economic situation where record levels of employment coincide with record levels of foodbank use and workers in poverty, there is a necessity for wages to be increased to a real living wage.“We cannot accept the current situation where full-time workers are struggling to survive from month to month, falling further into debt and relying on foodbanks to get by.“Aegis, along with our comrade in the DTUC, will be very active this year in challenging large employers who refuse to pay a real living wage to their staff while those at the top live lavish lestyles.”ExploitationThe Low Pay Commission is an independent body that advises the government about the National Living Wage and the National Minimum Wage.Niall McCarroll of Unison and Chairperson of Derry Trades Union Councilhas thrown down the gauntlet to local businesses to end exploitation and urged them to pay workers a living wage.He said: “DTUC officers along with our colleagues from UNISON Community Branch, Foyle Health Branch, Derry Education and Aegis collectively provided a voice for local workers when we met the Low Pay Commission in Derry.“DTUC used the opportunity to impress upon the LPC the precarious and unstable nature of employment across the City and District and how the scourge of low pay leaves workers and their families struggling to have any decent standards of living.“These demoralising standards of living are no more prevalent than within the localtourism and service industry where basic minimum wage and zero hour contacts are used by commerce groups and employers to maximise profits at the expense of local people.”Mr McCarroll continued: “How can this be justied when local hotels are regularly at full capacity and restaurants and cafes also busy and yet poverty pay is the dish of the day.“The LPC assured DTUC that they would report back to government, presenting their findings which included the call from DTUC for a minimum living wage of £ an hour for all workers, no matter what their age.“DTUC are committed to building on our campaign to stand in solidarity with local workers, whilst exposing bad employers and we will be engaging with all newly elected DCSDC councillors to end the exploitation of local workers.”DamagingThe Northern Ireland Hotels Federationis the representative body for the hotel sector.NIHF Chief Executive, Janice Gault, described accusations of low pay as \"very damaging\" to an industry which has \"done much to improve its image\".She said: \"Our members are subject to the same legal and employment framework as other sectors. Hotels currently have a wage content of around % of turnover.\"The sector has a iety of roles from entry level at the appropriate national minimum wage level of the candidate through to supervisory, management and executive roles.\"The Federation has not seen the evidence that the LPC received last week and therefore is not in a position to answer the specics. Nor have the NIHF been made aware of working conditions contra to current national minimum wage levels by any trade union official or employee in the Derry-Londonderry area.\"Ms Gault added: \"Allegations of this nature are very damaging and without having specic examples are impossible to abate.\"As an industry we have done much to improve our image: improving working hours, providing strong and well rewarded career paths and supporting qualications that give employees the opportunity to have greater skills to work globally.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Niall McCarroll, chairman of the Derry Trades Union Council, and members of Aegis in meeting with the Low Pay Commission."},{"url":null,"title":"foyle hospice weekly draw results winner","story":"Winners in this weeks Foyle Hospice Weekly Draw are - st prize: £,, Paul Breslinnd prize: £,, Rollover : rd prize: £, Terry Monaghanth prize: £, Diarmuid Campbellth prize: £, William Linton .googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"draft wales rally gb 2019 route","story":"Lights, cameras, action ndash the Wales Rally GB ceremonial start will be stagltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgted in Liverpool for ltspan classtruncate-full-screengtthe first timelt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Major innovations add to Wales Rally GB as  draft route is releasedHuge crowds are expected at this year#s Wales Rally GB\" Major innovations add to Wales Rally GB as  draft route is releasedA new street stage in Colwyn Bay is on the  schedule\" Major innovations add to Wales Rally GB as  draft route is releasedLocal hero Elfyn Evans makes a splash on Wales Rally GB.

Some say while those carrying out the work are obliging, they are not responsible the delay or the lack of communication.Businesses are also hoping that customers they have not seen for some time willwhen Irish Street s to a sense of normality.They say the loss of parking spaces has impacted on trade with the work forcing people not to use one of the townrsquos main car parks nearby.During last weekrsquos protest, one trader revealed that her business has been forced to go mobile, visiting the homes of elderly people who cannot safely access her premises in the town centre due to the public realm scheme.Restaurant owner Mizba Uddin says things have been ldquoterrible for his business since work on the project began.ldquoThe business has literally collapsed, he declared, standing outside his restaurant surrounded by barriers used by contractors.ldquoThe situation is very, very bad and we have even have people driving down the one-way system the wrong way. Parking spaces have been lost as a result of the work and not all will be ed when the scheme is completed. People are going where as we do not provide a delivery service.Mizba said one of his main concerns has been the lack of communication from those overseeing the project. He also urged those in charge of the scheme to talk to traders to let them know what is going on.He added: ldquoI was told that the scheme would end in March and have heard nothing since. I am relying on other people to tell me what is going on but it should not be like this. I cannot even clean my windows because there is so much dust everywhere.ldquoSummer time can be quiet for me. Everyone in Irish Street wants this project completed as quickly as possible. As the work continues, there are simply no customers going to any of the shops. The work is killing businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygalget woman’s two week walk meeting inspirational people  ","story":"A BALLYGALGET woman is one of two volunteers who are spending a fortnight walking in towns and villages around Northern Ireland meeting inspirational people who are improving their communities.Patricia Fleming, a former camogie player with Ballygalget John Mitchelrsquos GAC, called into her old club last Sunday accompanied by Rory Mullan from Derry.They were hand-picked from a raft of candidates to be Big Lunch walkers for this year.Starting last Friday, they are visiting dferent places in Northern Ireland ahead of the Big Lunch weekend on June -.The Big Lunch event is where over six million people through the UK will meet to share food and eat together.Patricia and Rory visited Ballygalget to hear about all the great work the club does in the surrounding area.Patricia, who now lives in Belfast with her family, told the club how its community work was inspiring.ldquoThe reason I picked Ballygalget is that Irsquom from here, Irsquove played on that pitch many times, but I also know the community spirit that exists within Ballygalget. It blows me away when I come home and hear all the things that are happening.ldquoWhen I went for my interview after applying to be one of the Big Lunch walkers, I said thatI was chosen I would like to bring the Big Lunch community walk into rural areas and to Ballygalget.ldquoPeople here are very community oriented.

The idea is to educate people about dementia: what are the signs and symptoms, and how to support someone living with the condition.ldquoEvery month we run a free two-hour workshop, with materials supplied by the Alzheimerrsquos Society.ldquoOur club is very much affected by dementia. Quite a number of people in the club are living with a diagnosis within their families. We want to reduce stigma and the social isolation people can feel.Aoe Savage, Ballygalget GACrsquos Health Club Officer, added: ldquoWe are working against social isolation within our area.ldquoWe are trying to improve health and wellbeing ndash both physical and mental health ndash of people who live nearby, on a cross-community basis.Ballygalget was the walkersrsquo third stop on their tour around Northern Ireland.

The first plan I viewed showed two parking spaces outside my door but they have been taken away.Businessman Francie Young, who is also upset about the y delay, also questioned the design of the scheme, pointing to a wide footpath at the top of Irish Street, close to the John Street junction.ldquoThe road will be considerably narrower at this point and can anyone tell me the reason for this  he asked, while Maurice Massey was critical of the lack of communication with Irish Street business owners, particularly in relation to the delay in completing the work.He said the business community should have been much better informed, with greater account taken of the impact the delayed scheme was having on trade.Alan Oakes said ldquocustomers have gone with businesses unsurethey will . He also appealed for better lines of communication between traders and those in charge of the scheme.It has also been confirmed that the work in Irish Street is impacting on patients attending a dental surgery, with those most affected the elderly and those with mobility problems.Traders say they are simply asking for communication and to be told what is happening, with the major concern that a project scheduled to last a few months had now entered its fth month, with work on only one side of the street largely completed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charity concert  in Seaforde  ","story":"A CONCERT takes place in Seaforde tomorrow night in aid of a Parkinsonrsquos charity.The locally-based Harmonic Progression womenrsquos community choir will be presenting their spring concert, entitled Makers of Music and Dreamers of Dreams, in Seaforde YFC Hall at .pm.Rehearsals are well underway for the concert which is inspired by the first line of Arthur OrsquoShaughnessyrsquos Ode.One of the choir members, Heather Knipe, and her husband, John, are climbing Mount Fuji in Japan for the Cure Parkinsonrsquos Trust and all donations at the door and from a raffle will be presented to this charity during the concert.Harmonic Progression.

The video was well received and no doubt there will be more versions in the future.Bruce Grobbelaar then rose, to a rapturous reception to deliver one of the slickest and wittiest after dinner speeches the club has heard.Stories from his early days as a  year old lsquokeeper with Highlanders FC, a Zimbabwean football club based in Bulawayo, to an eventual move to Vancouver Whitecaps and subsequent transfer to Crewe Alexandria until the legendary Bob Paisley signed him for Liverpool in .Grobbelaar played  times for the Reds in a trophy-laden career. Among the stories he told were e the events of May , , when his antics in a penalty shoot out against Roma helped Liverpool to win the European Cup.He also talked about his career after Liverpool and working with Alan Ball at Southampton at the height of the match fixing allegations that were made against him.When Ball was asked by the media why he was playing Grobbelaar in goal ahead of England international Dave Beasant, Ball reputedly said: ldquoI would rather have Bruce in goal trying to throw the game than Dave doing his best to save it.By common consensus, Bruce was one of the best speakers the club has had and has whetted the appetite for the future to renew the clubrsquos tradition of bringing over guest speakers.Bruce was presented with a small gt from the club by youth team coach Simon Thornton, a set of golf balls and towel from the Royal County Down Golf Club.Club secretary Andy Hall then spoke for a few minutes to highlight some of the highs and lows of the last  years and to thank IFA regional development officer Seamus Heath for all the work he does in promoting football across the Newry Mourne and Down Council area.Andy then invited IFA vice-chairman Jack Grundie to say a few words with Jack presenting the club with a gt to mark the occasion.County Antrim FA president Jim Jess also spoke warmly about the club and presented a memento to mark the occasion with Maurice Johnston, vice chair of the Mid Ulster Football League, congratulating the club on their th anniversary and presenting Tollymore chairman John McIlvenny with a gt to recognise the achievement.Newcastle League secretary Alan Craig was unfortunately taken ill before the dinner and was unable to attend and the club sends its warm wishes to him for a speedy recovery.The final official speaker was Elaine Junk, the former chair of the NI Womenrsquos Football Association during the period when Tollymore had a successful ladiesrsquo side.Elaine congratulated the club on its th anniversary and encouraged them to get a ladiesrsquo team back up and playing.With the official proceedings drawing to a close there was one last surprise with Adrian Howard presenting a le time achievement award on behalf of players and members to Andy Hall in recognition of all his work for the club.It was a wonderful gesture by the club and much appreciated by Andy.The evening concluded with dancing to the wonderful Fth Avenue with Bruce continuing to sign autographs and pose for pictures into the wee small hours..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Locals flying high in F15 championship  ","story":"ROGER Chamberlain and Charlie Horder won the Northern Ireland Flying Fteen Championship on Strangford Lough at the weekend.It was a deserved triumph for the Whiterock duo and also for Strangford Sailing Club, which hosted the event less than a month after the re-opening of its clubhouse which was gutted by an accidental fire in September .The five-race championship attracted a -strong fleet, which included a sizeable contingent of southern visitors, mainly from Dun Laoghaire.After three races on Saturday Chamberlain and Horder were in third place, behind Killyleagh pair Andrew McCleery and Colin Dougan mdash who got off to a flyer by winning the opening race mdash and overnight leaders Brian McKee and John Gibson, also from Whiterock, who were second and seventh in the first two races before winning the final race of the day.Chamberlain and Horder came out of the blocks early on Sunday and comfortably won the fourth race before sealing the championship with fth place in the final race.McKee and Gibson were a disappointing th in the fourth race, but with the discard brought into play, they still had a chance of outright victory.

beyond his power’ in Loughinisland report  ","story":"NORTHERN Irelandrsquos Police Ombudsman went beyond his legal powers in publishing a report ldquoreplete with determinations that RUC officers colluded with loyalists in the Loughinisland massacre, the Court of Appeal heard last week.Lawyers for two retired senior policemen claimed the watchdogrsquos damning findings on the Loughinisland atrocity should only have been releasedit had recommended prosecutions or disciplinary action against any of those under scrutiny.Judgment was reserved in the renewed bid by Raymond White and Ronald Hawthorne to have the report quashed.UVF gunmen opened fire at the Heights Bar in Loughinisland, Co Down as their victims watched a World Cup football match in June .The men killed were: Adrian Rogan , Malcolm Jenkinson , Barney Green , Daniel McCreanor , Patrick OrsquoHareand Eamon Byrne .Five others were also wounded in a sectarian attack for which no-one has been brought to justice.In June  the Ombudsman, Dr Michael Maguire, said collusion between some officers and the loyalists was a signicant feature in the murders.He found no evidence police had prior knowledge, but identied ldquocatastrophic failings in the investigation.Mr White, representing the Northern Ireland Retired Police Officersrsquo Association, and Mr Hawthorne, a former sub-isional police commander, have been involved in a long-running legal challenge to the published findings.A first hearing resulted in a ruling in  that the report was procedurally unfair and had failed to make clear it conclusions did not apply to Mr Hawthorne.At that time the watchdog agreed to remove any references to him to ensure he is not connected to any alleged wrongdoing mdash a move seen as complete vindication for the former police commander.A limited re-hearing before a dferent judge focused only on issues around the extent of the powers to publish the findings.In November last year a High Court judge rejected the retired officersrsquo case that Dr Maguire had exceeded his legal remit.Mr White and Mr Hawthorne are now now appealing that ruling.The former policemenrsquos barrister, David McMillen QC, stressed their complete support for the Ombudsmanrsquos role in scrutinising and holding officers to account.He argued, however, that the watchdog lacked the legislative authority to publish such ldquoconclusive findings in the Loughinisland report.ldquoHe simply does not have that power, Mr McMillen said.ldquoThis is an organ of the state, an important and very public organ of the state finding police officers guilty.Askedhe believed the Ombudsmanrsquos report had concluded police officers may have committed criminal offences, Mr McQuillen replied: ldquoIt was replete with those suggestions.But Mr McMillen rejected suggestions that the document could be amended to state there ldquomay be evidence of criminal or disciplinary offences.ldquoThe report is so infected with conclusive language all the way through, about what he found, that a simple rider would not make sense, he said.Barra McGrory QC, for the Ombudsman, countered that the legislation allowed him to express an opinion on the alleged collusion.He said: ldquoThe definition the Ombudsman has set out on collusion is broad enough to encompass behaviour and actions by police officers which cannot be identied as specic criminal offences which could be referredunder that part of the scheme.Following submissions Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan, sitting with Lord Justices Stephens and Deeny,

convenient for them.The survey revealed that of those who said they would recycle only when it was convenient, % indicated that they would be encouraged to recycle morethere was one bin that took all

compared to % of those in council areas that did not.Re-Gen Waste Ltd managing director, Joseph Doherty, said the survey results indicated that prioritising simplicity and convenience was the best approach to ensuring a high level of household recycling.He continued: ldquoSince April , glass can now be commingled with household recycling waste in the Down legacy council area, meaning that all householders across Newry, Mourne and Down can now put their glass into their blue bins.ldquoWe should see an marked improvement in recycling figures and a decrease in the percentage of glass placed in black bins across the entire council area.Mr Doherty said local authorities need to encourage the maximum number of people to recycle the maximum volume of materials, weighed against the cost of processing the material, and the potential financial benefits from reducing landfill costs, and selling on recyclable material.ldquoThe councils we with work in Northern Ireland, England and Scotland tell us that household friendly schemes such as commingling recyclables, plastic, paper, card, tins and cardboard and glass in one bin, are much preferable to residents than any pre-sort scheme using smaller containers or bins and that it is actively improving their recycling rates, he said.Last March, of the households in the Newry, Mourne and Down area that could commingle their glass with their recyclables in the same bin, % of respondents said they would recycle lessthey had to separate their household waste, including glass waste into separate caddies.Mr Doherty added: ldquoMore and more

the man tasked with the job of overhauling the countryrsquos ldquoided schools.At an Ulster University event in Belfast last week focusing on sectarianism, the Dundrum man said the segregated education issue needed to be addressed.He also criticised what he described as the ldquocasual sectarianism and ldquotribalism which characterises parts of society.He continued: ldquoI think we really have to address education, segregated education and I think that as a society we kind of have to start calling out that casual sectarianism.ldquoWhenever we had peace here we thoughtwe move on to a Glaswegian level of sectarianism that is fine, so we only hate each other every week when we go to football. That is not good enough. The tribalism of that is not good enough.The comedian also suggested that the integrated education term was ldquoinsulting.He explained: ldquoAround the rest of the world that is called education. What we have in this country is segregated education.The Dundrum man also paid tribute to the ldquobrilliant work of teachers but said people felt those high standards were enough and did not tackle the underlying ision.ldquoThe natural  of mixing and realising that we are exactly the same and having a school that has got a rugby team and a GAA team, you donrsquot have to go to that schoolyou like GAA. There are just certain things that we really need to have a look at and I am not sure that we are necessarily ready for it.Speaking at the Belfast event, Mr Kielty argued that changing the education system would have to be done by an international figure like former US senator George Mitchell.ldquoOnce we actually get through it we will go, lsquogee why didnrsquot we do that before now rsquo, but it is a dficult one, he conceded, suggesting that social media is contributing to the lack of exposure to dferent views.ldquoYour own opinion is folded back into yourself on the screen every day, he said. ldquoMore than ever, we actually have to put the screen down and make an effort to realise that we are the same.ldquoWe talk too much about dference here. You are either a British person living on the island of Ireland or you are an Irish person who is currently actually in the UK. You are actually a bit of both.Mr Kielty added: ldquoThe minute that we accept that that is going to move in a fluid way, and it is perfectly fine to be a bit of both, that is kind of where we need to be.Meanwhile, the charity which has been working for almost three decades to bridge the gap between starting integrated schools and securing full government support has welcomed Ulster University proposals for a concerted effort in Northern Ireland to eradicate sectarianism.The university, supported by the Sir George Quigley Fund, launched lsquoSectarianism in Northern Ireland: a Reviewrsquo at a conference at the UUrsquos Belfast campus last week.The Integrated Education Fundmdash which was established in  mdash praised the conference for addressing the issue and welcomed Patrick Kieltyrsquos comments that educating all children together is the way forward for a shared future.The review contains more than  proposals for how bodies including government, business, education, youth services, arts and sport could work collectively over a sustained period of time to foster greater collaboration and understanding across communities.As well suggesting that a government department should be established specically to tackle sectarianism, the researchers propose establishing a new civic body to help shape community efforts toward reconciliation.IEF chief executive Tina Merron said the organisation ldquoshares the vision, held by the overwhelming majority of citizens, of a united community and a shared future.Ms Merron said that at the signing of the Good Friday Agreement there were , pupils in  integrated schools, compared with more than , attending  integrated schools today.She said that with no government plan for integrated education, the growth was down to ldquodetermined campaigners and pioneering parents.She added: ldquoWe see a reformed education system as an essential ingredient of this future an education system which brings children, staff and governors from Catholic and Protestant traditions, as well as those of other faiths or none and of other cultures, together in schools, an education system which recognises and respects ersity and ensures that all young people feel confident and welcome in their school environment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein’s Casey chosen as district’s first citizen  ","story":"SINN Feinrsquos Charlie Casey is Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos new chairman.The Newry politicianrsquos appointment was confirmed at the local authorityrsquos annual meeting on Monday night when he succeeded the SDLPrsquos Mark Murnin as the districtrsquos first citizen.The new council vice-chairman is Rowallane SDLP councillor Terry Andrews, who succeeded Sinn Feinrsquos Oksana McMahon, who represented the Crotlieve area but lost her seat in the recent local government election.The new chairman was presented with his chain of office by his predecessor, who also losthis Slieve Croob seat at the recent election.The new first citizen said he was delighted to be nominated for the position by his party and hoped to do the position justice, urging all councillors to unite to protect services under the threat in the council area, particularly those in relation to the health and welfare of all, in particular, the most vulnerable.Cllr Casey also took time to thank Mr Murnin and Mrs McMahon for their work over the past year and the other councillors who were not ing to the council following the election.Addressing members as chairman for the first time, Cllr Casey urged them to fight for lesaving and le-changing services, champion the cause of equality and take forward the councilrsquos commitment of putting the organisation at the heart of everything it does.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos mission is to lead and serve the district as a prosperous and healthy area and ensure it is sustainable from an economic, environmental and social perspective.

Many of my comrades, as well as myself, have suffered injury and worse trying to preserve law and order during this period and it must be a terrible insult adding to injury to see two anti-unionist MEPs representing Northern Ireland.Many of my comrades have asked “What was it all for” when you see what has happened since  I have found it dficult to give an answer other than to say that it was right to do that at that time, to defeat terrorism.Viewing the results of the election today it appears to me that the electorate for whom we put our lives on the line for have despised our sacrice and decided that we were expendable, when it was a choice between the backstop, which means an eventual an united Ireland other than remaining in the United Kingdom.Sammy Brush MBE,BEM, Co TyroneJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  People   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News People Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           People      Lyra McKee: Murdered journalists sister offers to support her killerthey come forwardA sister of murdered journalist Lyra McKee has vowed to \"support\" her killersthey hand themselves in to police.

Outside court the man’s lawyer, Eoin Murphy of O’Muirigh Solicitors, said: “The signicance of parliamentary boundaries for representationat the highest level of our democracy is obvious.“Once the recommendations are adopted, they will be dficultnot impossible to change for at least the next election, which may affect how inidual constituents are represented for several years.”Mr Murphy stressed that the case was his client’s only option for challenging the proposals.“Given the very signicant effects of any legal error on the part of the Commission, and the essentially irreparable nature of those errors, the court quite correctly exercised an intense level of scrutiny and arrived at the correct conclusion that the Commission had fallen into legal error and acted in a procedurally unfair way.” try catch  TrendingN.I. motorist crashes car with R plates through clothes shop windowN.I. set to sizzle in long summer of intense heat -

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave.

One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them.

I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain. The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sto1.jpg","title":"ni business rates to undergo full review","story":"Posted on Thursday May  by John Mulgrew There will be a full review of Northern Ireland’s business rates system, a top civil servant has revealed. Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"could a new dawn boost ni business development","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business While Brexit is still upon us, John Simpson says the business sectors finances have proved stronger than predicted and lending could be boosted on the outside as the veil of uncertainty lts The darkest hour comes just before the dawn: an apt reference to the prospects when Brexit is finally taken out of the daily diet of news, concern about business disruption, and foreboding about dficult trading prospects. Brexit is proving to be a slow departure. This year the economy has proved more resilient than many feared. Employment has remained at high levels, jobs for skilled employees are available, and with less certainty personal incomes have been maintained.Political uncertainty and efficient business management are an uneasy mix. In the recent winter and springbusinesses have had to live with an intense series of destabilising influences. For over  years, businesses in Ireland and the UK have grown accustomed to near frictionless EU market conditions. customs duties had disappeared on all internal EU trading. For businesses on this island, the memory of cross-border customs duties had all been but forgotten.   Looking at the lending performances of some of our own banks, the numbers seem to be adding up. In its full year accounts for , Danske Bank posted pre-tax profit of £.m, while new lending rose % and overall business lending increased by %.Across Donegall Square, Ulster Bank saw its income rising from £m to £m during , while profit after impairments stood at £m. There was a % rise in new corporate lending, while small business rose by %.Meanwhile, across the UK as a whole, Barclays has announced a £bn lending fund as part of a series of initiatives to help small and medium-sized businessesto succeed and flourish through Brexit and beyond.Only older colleaguescan remember the perils of railway journeys interrupted by a one hour stop at Goraghwood station, close to Newry, while all passengers were asked by customs officersthey had ‘anything to declare’. More affluent older travellers would more likely recall the cross-border queuing requirement for the predecessor of the ‘green card’ for cars. Today, the challenge is of how to deliver the political agreement that the border on this island should be either frictionless or non-existent as the UK plans to leave the EU. In the new era there will be redefined relations between NI and the Republic, within the framework of UK-EU relations. The important part lies in negotiations on working arrangements that have not yet officially started.For the remaining part of  and going into , the business scene might be described as getting ‘ready for le after Brexit’.In the last three years the business community which forms the core of the private sector in Northern Ireland has been trading successfully.  The evidence from local reviews of the larger profit making businesses has been encouraging. Year-on-year turnover has been increasing faster than inflation and, even more critically, profitability has been maintained and often improved.Work to identy how well locally owned and controlled businesses have performed has been reassuring. To be included in the review of the Top  more profitable Northern Ireland business, which will be published in more detail, the cut-off point has risen to just on £m annual pre-tax profits. In a further reassuring feature and in contrast to the preceding year, during the year  the number of business casualties fell to a very small number.While the overall performance of businesses in the private sector has been better than is sometimes appreciated, there is a mixture of features in the complex matrix of business performance. The evidence is often from personal subjective sources but the elements do point to a consistent pattern. Businesses have been trading, in general, with improved profits but with turnover rather less buoyant. Employment has been increasing, now more slowly, but pay rateshave not fully recovered from the fall in real earnings in the past decade. Interestingly at a regional and national level, changes in wage rates have not shown the boost of an inflationary increase that might have been expected when unemployment levels have fallen to near record lows.Bargaining in the labour market has been restrained, probably influenced by the siren voices of emerging problems as the Brexit withdrawal agreement has dominated the political and economic policy agenda. This points to the emergence of a contrast between the trend in overall business profitability, which has improved, alongside the trend for inidual personal incomes to lag behind the real levels of the past decade. To a modest degree, business profitability may have improved relative to changes in the costs of the payroll.While the scale of the dference should be treated with caution, as business evolves during the rest of , business finance may be better placed to activate improving investment plans.The post-Brexit business scene should be pointing to reduced uncertainty, even with some predictable new business obstacles, and a helpful change in government economic policy to incentivise faster economic expansion. That prospect, alongside a business sector that has a stronger capacity to invest and grow, makes the months ahead more encouraging than many experts expect.In summary, the business sector is understandably anxious to see aof greater business stability and, for a mixture of reasons, may now be more likely to implement more ambitious investment programmes. Add to this combination the possibility that official Government economic policy will be more flexibleand there is a hope that, out of the recent grey clouds of possible recession, there will be incentives leading to a more buoyant economy here.Just one moment of caution: the brightness of a new dawn in  may be dimmedthe political processes constrain the application of improved economic policies through a refreshed local administration. Business has been performing well, despite the huge levels of uncertainty. However, the political environment could drown out an improving economy. That challenge has not changed.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/graham_11.jpg","title":"word from the wise graham lapsley","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Graham Lapsley, head of private banking, Danske Bank How did you start out in business   Banking has always been in my blood as my father joined Belfast Banking Co Ltdin . As a boy I remember being in Northern Bank branches ‘helping out’ when my father was completing regular evenings doing overtime. This was an environment that I was familiar with, although I didn’t ever think I would make banking a career. In  I found myself in Limavady branch and thoroughly enjoyed branch banking at a time when there were no computers, no autobanks and lots of staff. I’ve benefited from lots of dferent roles at the Bank in my career, each bringing its own challenges. I left my role as head of personal credit last year to take up my current position as head of private banking. What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far On a personal level changing job roles always brought new challenges. Change is a constant which I accept and while I’ve worked in Danske Bank for  years I have had senior roles in branch banking, wealth management, business banking, risk management and now private banking.   As an area manager in branch banking, I found the leadership of the transition from Australian ownership to Danish ownership in  a huge challenge. This change was as exciting as it was challenging as we benefited from huge investment and the Dane’s leading edge technology. I didn’t go directly from school to university, but I’ve been lucky enough to have had employer support to complete a business studies degree and a masters’ degree in executive leadership. I’ve also attended business schools in Boston, Lausanne and London, with each giving me new tools to add into my skill set.  How would you describe your management style  I am energetic and enthusiastic. I love working with our relationship managers and customers to build a financial solution. I am very results oriented and prefer a direct style. I am very self-awareand have a positive outlook.  What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I’m not sure that I would change anything. I’ve learnt from my mistakes and that made me a better banker in the long term. Perhaps my ambition in my early career took me into roles that didn’t match my skill sets, but I did take away vital learnings from these experiences  Have you done it all on your own  Absolutely not. My we Sonya and family have always been a great support and this enabled me to have a good work le balance. I have a strong network personally and professionally, which is mutually supportive. I’ve also been lucky enough to have worked with many leaders who have greatly inspired me.  What’s more important, your product or your people  In Private Banking, without a doubt our people. We are a people business and our strength in Private Banking rests with the professionalism of the private banking team. We offer premium relationship management to our private banking customers, supported by leading edge digital solutions.

Danske is also the leading corporate and business bank in Northern Ireland, and many of these customers have their personal needs looked after by my private banking team.  What piece of advice would you give to a  year old you  You’ll never be judged on what happens to you, but you will be judged on how you react to it. And you won’t get the experience you need, until the day after you needed it.

I’ve heard employers bemoan the fact that this generation can’t communicate face-to-face or they place more emphasis on their passions outside of work than their own career development.While some of this is no doubt grounded in their experience, employers perhaps need to adjust how they engage with the new generation beyond just offering them quirky perks and trendy working environments. Hays recently sponsored The GoodIdea, the biggest ever AI hackathon in NI organised by AINIand Hackily – a two-day event hosted by QUB School of Computing and Ulster University Magee campus for around  hackers in Belfast and  in Derry.The hackathon provided a welcoming and collaborative environment for hackers to build out brilliant, innovative, and impactful ideas using AI under a theme of ‘AI for good’, where hackers were challenged to utilise open data sources to create an innovative solution to a real-world problem.It was an opportunity for students – who made up % of the attendees – and experienced professionals to meet fellow hackers, learn new technologies, and work alongside seasoned mentors.Far from being underwhelmed by Generation Z, we were inspired by the talent pools from dferent backgrounds such as computer science, physics and maths, coming together to collaborate with each other, learn about bleeding edge technologies and also to put their skills to use in creating something that was a benefit to society. For example, one of the teams invented an algorithm for a computer to read British sign language using a webcam.These were ambitious, driven, competitive young people who worked brilliantly in their teams and certainly didn’t struggle to communicate, eventhey arrived alone and joined a team. A team from Glasgow made the journey across to take part and the hackathon ran right through Saturday night – so we couldn’t fault their work ethic.There were prizes, mentorship and funding available to the winners of the hackathon, as well as recruitment advice and workshops provided to students and professionals by Hays’ own experts across software development, data engineering and cyber security.But the main attraction was undoubtedly in the opportunity to co-create new ideas about how to apply technology to the world they will run in future. That is hugely positive and our challenge as employers must be to make sure the students who will be the candidates of the future in NI’s thriving tech community are encouraged to put that passion into their careers.The undergraduate community is an under-served community of future leaders in terms of recruitment and our desire is to equip undergraduates with the right understanding of what employers in the tech sector want and how they can build their personal brand for the future.Employers need to get past the myths about Generation Z and focus on helping younger employees find meaning in their workthey are to unlock their potential.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/5g1.jpg","title":"belfast to get superfast g mobile broadband this month","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by John Mulgrew Suzanne Wylie, Belfast City Council with Karen Dundas, EE Victoria Square store manager Belfast is to become one of six UK cities to get superfast G mobile broadband later this month, it has emerged.
