The Senate on Thursday passed a bill to allow the debt ceiling to be raised by $480bn through early December, which the treasury department estimates will be enough to allow the government to temporarily avert an unprecedented default on $28tn of debt obligations. The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, announced the morning before its passage that he had reached a deal with the Republican Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, to clear the way for the vote on a short-term extension with GOP support. The movement came after McConnell made a tactical retreat to back down from weeks of refusal to allow Democrats to raise the debt ceiling by any measure other than through a complicated procedure known as reconciliation that would have required a party-line vote. The justice department announced Friday that it would not file federal charges against the white police officer who shot and paralyzed Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last year. That officer, Rusten Sheskey, was not charged by local prosecutors in the incident and returned to duty earlier this year. “After a careful and thorough review, a team of experienced federal prosecutors determined that insufficient evidence exists to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the KPD officer willfully violated the federal criminal civil rights statutes,” the justice department said in a press release. Blake, a Black man, was shot seven times as officers tried to arrest him on an outstanding warrant. He has not been able to walk since, but said he expects to do so soon. The shooting, which occurred just months after George Floyd was killed by police in Minnesota, sparked several nights of chaotic protests. During one of those protests, Kyle Rittenhouse, an Illinois teen, shot three people, killing two. He claims he sent a letter to the National Archives in defense of the office of the presidency and the constitution, among other things. He said the investigation into the attack of the US Capitol was about “using the power of the government to silence ‘Trump’ and our Make American Great Again movement” – no explanation why Trump is in quotations.  “My administration, and the great patriots who worked on behalf of the American people, will not be intimidated,” he wrote. “On Indigenous Peoples’ Day, our nation celebrates the invaluable contributions and resilience of Indigenous peoples, recognizes their inherent sovereignty, and commits to honoring the federal government’s trust and treaty obligations to tribal nations,” Biden said. For decades, Indigenous rights groups have maintained that the federal holiday of Columbus Day overlooks the colonialism, enslavement, discrimination and land grabs that followed the Italian explorer’s 1492 arrival in the Americas. More and more cities have begun recognizing Indigenous Peoples’ Day on Columbus Day in recent years.   “For generations, general policies systematically sought to assimilate and displace native people and eradicate native cultures,” the proclamation states. “Today, we recognize Indigenous peoples’ resilience and strength as well as the immeasurable positive impact that they have made on every aspect of American society.” Biden also issued a separate proclamation commemorating Columbus Day – one that also declares 11 October Columbus Day as well as Indigenous Peoples’ Day – but that proclamation makes a point to acknowledge “the painful history of wrongs and atrocities that many European explorers inflicted on tribal nations and Indigenous communities”.  “It is a measure of our greatness as a nation that we do not seek to bury these shameful episodes of our past – that we face them honestly, we bring them to the light, and we do all we can to address them,” the proclamation reads. Donald Trump, in a two-page letter to the National Archives, indicated on Friday that he wanted to assert executive privilege over 45 documents identified by the National Archives as responsive to the committee’s request. “Should the committee persist in seeking other privileged information, I will take all necessary and appropriate steps to defend the Office of the Presidency,” Trump wrote. However, only the person currently in office can declare executive privilege – and Trump is not currently in office. “After my consultations with the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice, President Biden has determined that an assertion of executive privilege is not in the best interests of the United States, and therefore is not justified as to any of the documents,” Remus wrote in a letter obtained by the .  She noted – and White House press secretary Jen Psaki later confirmed at the press briefing – that privilege may be evaluated on a “case-by-case basis”, and some future material may still be protected.  “Ensuring the integrity of US borders is of utmost importance, and is not incompatible with the fundamental duty to respect the dignity, humanity, and rights of all iniduals seeking entry to the United States,” the letter states. “We reiterate our call for the Biden administration to act swiftly in appointing a new special envoy for Haiti, and to work with our international partners throughout the region to find immediate solutions that places the protection needs of Haitian migrants and the long-term stability of Haiti at the core of our approach.”  This comes after Daniel Foote, the former special envoy for Haiti, testified before the House foreign affairs committee about his abrupt resignation in September over what he called the Biden administration’s “inhumane” mass deportation of Haitian migrants and asylum seekers. He resigned shortly after shocking photos were published showing US border patrol agents on horseback using their reins on desperate Haitian refugees by the banks of the Rio Grande. Let us recap: Donald Trump had directed Bannon and three other former aides - former social media czar Dan Scavino, former defense department official Kash Patel and former chief of staff Mark Meadows - to ignore subpoenas from the House committee, claiming that the material that investigators were seeking is covered by executive privilege. But only the person currently in office can declare executive privilege - and Trump is not currently in office. Protections for all three of these monuments were stripped or scaled down under the Trump administration. “The protection of public lands must not become a pendulum that swings back and forth depending on who is in public office,” Biden said. “It’s not a partisan issue.” Interior secretary Deb Haaland – the first Native American interior secretary in US history – teared up speaking about the importance of these protections.  “Thank you, Mr President, for the profound action you are taking today to permanently protect the homelands of our ancestors,” she said. “Our songs, our languages and our cultures are strong, and many people from many Indian tribes have sung and spoken in unison to protect this sacred place.”Committee chairman Bennie Thompson and vice chair Liz Cheney just released a statement saying they now “will swiftly consider advancing a criminal contempt of Congress referral”.  Donald Trump had directed Bannon and three other former aides - former social media czar Dan Scavino, former defense department official Kash Patel and former chief of staff Mark Meadows - to ignore the subpoena, claiming that the material that the committee is seeking from the four is covered by executive privilege. Thompson and Cheney said Meadows and Patel are “engaging” with the committee.

Meeting and event spaces as well as horse racing facilities will be included, although indoor meeting and event spaces must be able to maintain physical distancing between people, Reuters reports. The easing of restrictions comes as the latest modeling showed Canada is expected to see a decline in its Covid-19 cases in the coming weeks, a top medical official said on Friday. England’s manager was keen to offer a considered take on the subject before his side’s World Cup qualifier against Andorra, which was given the green light after being thrown into doubt for a couple of hours after a fire at the Estadi Nacional on Fridayyesterday afternoon. Southgate defended his players’ reluctance to support jabs publicly, even though they have been vocal on other social issues, and he suggested one problem preventing a larger uptake is some are more susceptible to rumours online. Vaccination rates vary across the Premier League and Tammy Abraham is the only England player to confirm he has been double-jabbed. The issue remains a sensitive topic around the England camp – Fikayo Tomori and Jesse Lingard argued this week that it was a personal choice – and Southgate, who dismissed reports that most of his players remain unvaccinated, offered a worrying insight into the mindset inside dressing rooms. Those figures are up from the 399,552,444 vaccine doses the CDC said had gone into arms by Thursday out of 482,326,275 doses delivered. The agency said 216,573,911 people had received at least one dose, while 186,917,921 people were fully vaccinated as of 6:00 a.m. ET on Friday, Reuters reports. The booster dose would be available on condition that at least six months have passed since people completed their primary vaccination cycle, the ministry said, Reuters reports. The speed of the Territory’s vaccine rollout seems be plateauing more quickly than in other states, largely due to much slower rates of uptake in some remote Indigenous communities. The television and social media campaign, titled “It’s time to take our seats, Australia”, will be rolled out across the country from 9 October, with an undertaking by SBS to translate the advertisement into at least eight languages, including Auslan. Featuring an array of hauntingly vacant theatres, auditoria and outside stage seating, the ads encourage people to “take a seat” at a vaccination clinic before doing so at a live performance event. Correspondence obtained by the  under freedom of information laws reveals the former MP told health department officials he would source the anti-malarial drugs from China on condition that a “small copy” of the Palmer Foundation logo was printed on the packets, along with a message stating they had been “donated by the Palmer Foundation for the benefit of the Australian people”. The Palmer Foundation is a private philanthropic entity set up and headed by Palmer. The department refused the request, telling Palmer the labelling would breach Australia’s strict laws on medical packaging. A senior government official suggested that the health minister, Greg Hunt, could instead “publicly acknowledge the donation on a major TV or press interview” once the hydroxychloroquine was in use. Palmer subsequently agreed to supply the drugs without any mention of his foundation on the labels. “As the supply of Pfizer vaccine is sufficient in the territory ... the chief epidemiologist has decided not to use the Moderna vaccine in Iceland,” according to a statement published on the website of the Health Directorate. This decision owed to “the increased incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with the Moderna vaccine, as well as with vaccination using PfizerBioNTech,” the chief epidemiologist said. For the past two months, Iceland has been administering an additional dose “almost exclusively” of the Moderna vaccine to Icelanders vaccinated with Janssen, a single-dose serum marketed by America’s Johnson \u0026amp Johnson, as well as to elderly and immunocompromised people who received two doses of another vaccine."},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker how many people have been inoculated in ireland","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

On average, one person met 4.3 others from outside their household during the previous 48 hours, according to the ESRI analysis. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillAlmost two out of three staff have been to their workplace recently, according to new monitoring data demonstrating the easing of Covid-19 restrictions.During the previous week 44 per cent of adults, or 62.5 per cent of workers, went to their workplace at some point, the social activity measure conducted for the Department of Health found.Social activity increased again, following a drop-off during the summer, and there were significant rises in visits to retail, hospitality venues and exercise venues.On average, one person met 4.3 others from outside their household during the previous 48 hours, but 30 per cent reported meeting no one.Four out of 10 people had a close contact the previous day, and one-fifth made a home visit. However, almost all the additional visits and contacts were with vaccinated people, according to the analysis by the Economic and Social Research Institute.While visits to workplaces, meetings, social visits and contacts are at their highest level since January, mitigating behaviours are on the decline.More than one-quarter of people report not engaging in behaviours such as mask-wearing, social distancing or hand hygiene when leaving home.The ESRI categorises one-fifth of the population as “socialisers” who visit a higher than average number of risky locations. One in eight people are classed a socialisers who rarely take precautions against infection.New casesA further 2,002 cases of Covid-19 were reported by the department on Friday. It said there has been an average of 1,242 cases over the last five days. The department said 354 people were in hospital with the disease, including 73 patients in intensive care. HSE chief executive Paul Reid said on Friday that said 67 per cent of Covid-19 patients in intensive care were not vaccinated.Northern Ireland’s Department of Health said two people with the disease had died in the last 24 hours and that 1,276 cases had been reported. There were 360 Covid-positive patients in the North’s hospitals on Friday, including 35 in intensive care.According to the ESRI research, almost 40 per cent of people who exercised indoors said the facility they used was not well ventilated.Sixty per cent of people felt there was some element of risk in their behaviour over the preceding 48 hours, with 11 per cent saying their behaviour was highly risky.People associated risk with large events such as weddings or funerals, going to college and using public transport. Generally, people leaving home recognised the risk involved, but those who went to church appeared to believe it reduced their risk of infection compared with staying at home.Perception of riskPeople’s perception of risk was driven by the number of people they met and the locations they visited, rather than the measures they took to mitigate that risk. “This discounting of mitigation behaviours contrasts with public health advice,” the ESRI notes.Around one-third of the population remain highly worried about Covid-19, and many choose not to meet people outside their household. Even among younger people, more than 30 per cent of under-40s remain highly worried.While more than 90 per cent have received their digital vaccine cert, one-third who went to a restaurant or pub say this was not checked.Meanwhile, there were 15 Covid-related deaths last week, of which 14 involved people aged 65 years and older, according to the latest bulletin from the Central Statistics Office. Cases declined 6 per cent, and the proportion of cases in children aged 14 and under also dropped, from 30 per cent the previous week to 23 per cent.Cases among teachers and other education staff have risen to 6 per cent of all workplace cases following a third week-on-week rise.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"burst main leaves much of south dublin without water","story":"A significant amount of south Dublin is without water on Friday night after a major pipeline burst.

The water outage is likely to impact Leeson Street, Ballsbridge, Stillorgan, Blackrock, Donnybrook, Merrion, Booterstown, Clonskeagh, Ranelagh, Rathmines, Terenure, Rathfarnham, Windy Arbour and surrounding areas in Dublin city.Irish Water said the repair works would likely to be completed at around 6am and that those in affected properties should allow two to three hours after the estimated restoration time for supplies to fully return.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion poll even green party voters are cool on many climate measures","story":"A particularly sensitive proposal to reduce emissions is the reduction in the national cattle herd.

Photograph: Nick Bradshaw When Paul Gallagher became Attorney General for the second time last year, he was one of the highest-paid barristers in the Four Courts with annual fee income estimated at €1.5 million-€2 million. Now his work on three private cases after he became the State’s chief law officer has thrust him into the Opposition’s unwelcome glare. It is not Gallagher’s first brush with controversy in recent times: the August publication of his legal advice on outdoor gatherings after Katherine Zappone’s social event in the Merrion hotel led to claims that Ministers were “politicising” his role. The latest involves claims of a clash of interests between his public role as chief legal adviser to the Government and his private role advising clients professionally. The Government has dismissed such claims in forthright terms. Gallagher, who attends Cabinet, received explicit backing this week from Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan. Coalition leaders, who admire him for his panoramic expertise and relentless work rate, had given him permission to continue working on some private cases.“They think he is great,” says one person who has contact with Ministers every day about the Cabinet’s views on Gallagher. “Some of them are practically in awe of him.”One person who has dealt with him and other attorneys speaks admiringly of his work rate, observing that he appears to get through twice as much work as anyone else they have seen.Gallagher was the personal choice of the Taoiseach to do the job. Martin had been supremely impressed by Gallagher when he was attorney general in the last Fianna Fáil government, led by Brian Cowen, which had endured the financial crash and the bailout of 2008-2010. But few outside the top echelon of Cabinet and the law were aware of it, and some legal colleagues believe he was unwise to continue representing former Independent News \u0026amp Media directors after becoming Attorney General. Big moneyThe affair has thrown a spotlight on Gallagher’s successful work in the world of big money business litigation, where one solicitor says he was regarded for many years as a senior counsel of choice “for anything which was really serious”. For example, he was paid €612,242 for his private work on the State’s successful challenge in the European courts to the Apple tax ruling. It was said at the time that the Department of Finance had sent him before judges with nothing less than Ireland’s economic model at stake.Gallagher’s private work largely came to a halt when Martin asked him to return as Attorney General, a post he first held between 2007 and 2011 at the height of the financial crisis. He is said to have taken the post only reluctantly. His staff includes one special adviser, Liam O’Daly, a former director general of the Attorney General’s office who is known to carry Gallagher’s considerable authority in dealings with officials. The annual salary for the attorney general post is €181,005 but the effective rate is 10 per cent lower after a Cabinet decision in July 2020 to reduce Government remuneration. Such pay is far below Gallagher’s previous income so his work as Attorney General comes at a big opportunity cost. “I would imagine that it doesn’t pay him at all to take this and that he probably does it out of a sense of public service,” said a senior legal figure. “Of the commercial senior counsel, in my view he would be the highest earner of the high earners. His practice is more like an industry than a practice because it is so high volume.” Another legal figure said some lawyers may have been pleased to see him leave the Four Courts because it left a sizeable “Paul Gallagher-sized hole” to fill in the allocation of lucrative case work. Gallagher was born in Tralee in 1955 and attended the Christian Brothers school in the town before going to Dublin for his secondary education, at Castleknock College. He is a graduate of UCD, the King’s Inns and Cambridge University, with degrees in law, history and economics. He is married to Dr Bláthna Ruane, a senior counsel and constitutional historian who was partner at solicitors McCann FitzGerald before being called to the bar. Wealthy he no doubt is, but he is not a man to flaunt it. “He’d never drive a new car, it’s always old and Kerry reg,” said an acquaintance, noting his penchant for second- or third-hand Mercedes. “He’s the most ordinary guy, a real Kerryman. You could imagine him in a mart.” ‘Amiable’ and ‘chatty’At the age of 66, when many think of nothing but retirement, Gallagher is still a man in a hurry. “He’s an amiable, chatty character, but he doesn’t stop to chat because he’s so busy. He’d chat to you on the move,” the acquaintance added. The story has often been told how Gallagher had two secretaries in private practice, as one alone could not keep up with his pace of work. It has been no different in his latest phase as Attorney General, even as civil servants worked from home in a succession of lockdowns. At an online video meeting one Sunday, officials logging on from home in weekend garb were astonished to see the Attorney General beaming in from his office dressed in suit and tie and ready for action. “He drives them hard,” said one observer. Another said he was known for his “omnivorous” legal curiosity, with a personality capable of extemporising at length and making a “deep impression” on international officials Many in the Government regard him as the best and most efficient attorney general they have ever dealt with. In some accounts, certain Fine Gael Ministers want Gallagher to stay on when Varadkar is scheduled to return as taoiseach at the end of Martin’s term in December 2022. “Among the Fine GaelBlueshirt wing, he’s very much respected,” said a person who is close to the party. The esteem in which he is held in the Coalition – similar to the high regard in legal circles and indeed the judiciary – has helped to insulate Gallagher in the face of opposition attacks over his private work. There is no question of him being forced out, say Government insiders. But that work has still raised hackles, not least because it continued right up until last Saturday week – September 25th – some 15 months after the Attorney General took office with permission to close out some prior litigation commitments. Acting in a private capacity, Gallagher took part in a hearing that day before High Court inspectors who are examining the affairs of INM. He represented former INM directors – one of them a current director of its successor company, Mediahuis Ireland – at another hearing before the inspectors the previous Saturday. The inspection was sought by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the State authority responsible for enforcing business law, after an investigation into matters raised in protected disclosures by INM former chief executive Robert Pitt and former chief financial officer Ryan Preston. ‘Barrister by night’Róisín Shortall, co-leader of the Social Democrats, was quick to question the Attorney General’s involvement in a private capacity after it was first reported by The  four days after the latter hearing. “There is the obvious conflict of the Attorney General being involved in a case in which the State is on the other side,” she told the Dáil, asking whether Gallagher was Attorney General “by day and a more ordinary barrister by night”. The Government insisted there was no conflict, saying the court inspectors and the corporate law enforcer were independent in their functions.Shortall sent further questions to Varadkar, who replied by letter this week saying Gallagher’s involvement in the INM case “was scheduled to cease” on September 25th and “did cease on that date”. The case was one of three which the Attorney General “considered he had a personal obligation to discharge”, Varadkar said. In addition to INM, Gallagher had represented Permanent TSB in a private capacity in a long-running case against the Minister for Finance over the bank’s nationalisation. Pete Skoczylas, a litigant in the proceedings, complained about Gallagher’s work for the bank to the Standards in Public Office Commission in April. The commission dismissed the complaint in June. Gallagher also represented plaintiffs in an action by Russian chemical group TogliattiAzot, one of the world’s largest ammonia producers, against defendants including Dmitry Mazepin, a Moscow-based oligarch who is majority-owner of ammonia producer Uralchem, involving lots of companies registered in the British Virgin Islands and elsewhere.Although the Government has said Gallagher’s private work was prolonged by court delays due to coronavirus, Shortall is not convinced. “It is wholly inappropriate for the AG to have continued with his private work for such a long period of time and it is worrying that Cabinet members have not acknowledged this,” she said. ‘Limited information’“We have been provided with very limited information about the other two cases the AG was involved in and are still none the wiser as to whether there may have been other non-court legal work – mediations, settlements or arbitrations – that the AG engaged in. This needs to be clarified.”Asked whether the Attorney General carried out any non-court private work, the Government replied: “Other than the three private litigation matters previously identified, the Attorney General has had no other private professional obligation to discharge following his appointment and did not engage in settlements, mediations or arbitrations.”No barrister colleague has openly criticised Gallagher’s work on the INM case, although some have privately, saying there was an inconsistency and that the case was in a different category to other commercial litigation. “The reason people say nothing is because his reputation is stellar and also the fact that he is such an ordinary guy. If he was some toffee-nosed, south Dublin politically correct-spouting guy, someone would take a turn against him but with Gallagher what you see is what you get,” said the retired solicitor. Another legal figure, who is familiar with the constraints of high office, said it was acceptable for an attorney general to tidy up some limited work while being mindful of the need to avoid any risk of a conflict. “Anybody who has to bring to a close what he or she is dealing with, should do so in a discreet way, and bring it to a conclusion.” Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"poll majority support payment of pandemic bonus for frontline workers","story":"Almost half of all respondents  said the bonus  should be paid to frontline hospital and emergency services workers only. Photograph: Patrick Bolger BloombergA large majority of voters support the payment of a pandemic bonus for frontline workers in the public sector, according to the latest Ipsos MRBI opinion poll.A smaller majority believes the Government should pay a bonus to private sector workers, such as retail workers and taxi drivers.Almost four out of five respondents to the poll (79 per cent) said they were in favour of “paying a pandemic bonus to public sector frontline workers”, with just 18 per cent opposed.Asked if a bonus is to be paid to public sector workers, to whom should it be paid, almost half of all respondents (47 per cent) said it should be paid to “frontline hospital and emergency services workers only”.But 30 per cent of respondents said the bonus should be paid to “all frontline workers in the public sector, including gardaí, teachers and bustrain drivers etc”. Thirteen per cent said it should be paid to “all public sector workers including those who were not public facing or were remote working during the pandemic”. Ten per cent of respondents offered no opinion.Asked if Government should pay a pandemic bonus “to private sector and frontline workers (eg, retail workers, taxi drivers, private hospital workers, etc)”, a slim majority (52 per cent) of respondents agreed. A substantial minority of voters (40 per cent) were opposed.Political controversy The proposal for bonuses has been the subject of considerable political controversy in recent weeks. A number of public sector unions have indicated that if bonuses are being paid, they want their members to be included. Teachers unions first said they wanted to be involved in discussions about a bonus, but later said they were not seeking any payment. Some Government TDs were critical of the plans, which are still under discussion. Meanwhile, despite the decline in public satisfaction with the Government and its leaders in the poll, reported earlier this week in The , a large majority of voters believe the Coalition has done a good job managing the pandemic. Approval ratings for the Government as a whole, for Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar all showed sharp falls since June, while support for Fine Gael dropped by five points.However, almost three-quarters (74 per cent) of respondents to the poll said the Government was “doing a good job in its handling of the pandemic”, with 22 per cent saying it was not doing a good job. Older voters, those in Dublin and wealthier voters were more likely to believe the Government was doing a good job.However, voters are ided on the next steps. Asked “if the country is ready now to remove all restrictions and get back to normal, or are we not yet ready to go back to normal”, a thin majority of respondents (52 per cent) said they favoured a return to normal. However, a substantial minority (44 per cent) said the country was not yet ready.The remaining restrictions are due to be lifted on October 22nd.The poll was conducted among 1,200 adults at 120 sampling points across all constituencies on October 2nd, 4th and 5th. Interviews were conducted in person.

This was the choice of the Polish people,” Mr Beaune said.Polish opposition parties accused the government of attempting to pull the country out of the EU and called for mass protests.The ruling is “the de facto path to Polexit”, Borys Budka of the centre-right Civic Platform party wrote on Twitter. “It is impossible to be a member of the European Union without following the basic principles on which the community is based.”Attention has turned to what tools the EU has left to enforce its legal order in the face of Polish recalcitrance, despite successive legal infringement procedures and orders.The commission has held back €57 billion due for Poland in grants and loans under the EU’s Covid economic stimulus fund as a result of concerns about the observance of the rule of law, and the escalation of the standoff has made payment difficult to imagine.Some members of the European Parliament have called for the commission to go further and withhold budget payments to Poland, using a new and rule-of-law safeguard rule for EU cash.“The only language Warsaw understands is freezing money,” German Green MEP Daniel Freund told media, pointing out that Polish regions had reversed a policy of declaring “LGBT-free zones” after the EU responded by freezing millions of euro of funding to local municipalities.The executive has already asked the EU’s top court to impose daily fines on the country for every day that it ignores an order to suspend a controversial chamber set up to discipline judges, which could be subtracted from EU funds. The development may also have implications for whether Poland can count on fellow member states to execute European arrest warrants issued by its courts.The Irish Supreme Court asked the European Court of Justice earlier this year to clarify whether such arrest warrants from Poland should be honoured, expressing concerns about the rule of law in the country and whether defendants can be guaranteed a fair trial.The commission vowed to use all powers at its disposal to protect the EU’s legal order, as experts warned that the single market relies on legal coherence between its members through the principle that EU rulings have the final say.The executive’s legal services will examine the Polish ruling and “next steps” will then be taken, commission president Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. “I am deeply concerned by yesterday’s ruling of the Polish Constitutional Tribunal,” she said.“EU citizens as well as companies doing business in Poland need the legal certainty that EU rules, including rulings of the European Court of Justice, are fully applied in Poland.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Fears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"appointment sea lord head armed forces shows navy has become","story":"The British public was always going to be well served no matter which candidate for the job of Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) got the nod.All the front-runners were erudite, resourceful and respected men. (They were all still men, though, but the years of a male-only shortlist are surely numbered.) However, in what Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, likes to call the Game of Thrones, the selection of Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the First Sea Lord, goes beyond primus inter pares.Britain’s military strategy, for the next decade at least, will focus on the Royal Navy and the “tilt” to the Indo-Pacific. That is not to deny the relative capabilities of the other services (although the Army, in particular, faces big problems with re-capitalisation). It is also not a blinkered obeisance to the two new aircraft carriers, impressive as they are. It is, instead, an acknowledgement that Britain aspires to a greater role in world affairs after two decades pursuing the chimera of liberal intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan. That requires a maritime strategy, incorporating, but not limited to, the military. The Government’s recent Integrated Review (IR) of defence, security and foreign policy pointed Britain in this new direction.Alessio Patalano, professor of war and strategy in East Asia at King’s College London, said at its heart the IR sees state-on-state competition as “the fuel behind international relations”.That matters to the Government because it is the current thinking in Washington.“If we’re serious about being forward-leaning, we need to use the maritime space as a launching pad for engaging with others,” Mr Patalano said. “The Navy is part of the broader tools of statecraft.”The Government views the Indo-Pacific region as the key area to shape future global competition, important in resisting China’s attempts to undermine the international rules-based order.Military power, as a tool of the statecraft needed to meet these challenges, will be designed in the medium term to bolster the threat from states, not terrorists.The Navy will play a central role in making Britain’s Armed Forces more mobile, forward-deployed and engaged with allies.It’s about “places not bases” and exercising in new areas. In short, turning up and being seen by allies to care about the region. As one US general put it, “virtual presence means actual absence”. Adm Radakin’s stewardship of the Royal Navy chimed with the Government’s desire for a renewed British military presence around the world.The forging of new partnerships through the ongoing deployment of the Carrier Strike Group to the Indo-Pacific region is a practical example of Britain’s new military posture.Adm Radakin’s personality is suited to furthering that strategy.In an interview with the Wavell Room, a military think tank, he described himself as inquisitive, keen to learn and curious about the world. He said optimism was “a fundamental trait of leadership”.These characteristics will be tested by a revanchist and belligerent Russia in Europe and a perpetually (perhaps willingly) provoked China in the east. “It feels to me that it is hard to be a pessimistic leader,” Adm Radakin said. He said even if a situation looked grim it was a leader’s responsibility to say “this is a noble and selfless thing to do, and we’re going to do it”.His tenure as CDS could well be judged on those words.More from NewsBoris Johnson should yield to the eco-mobs, says Scottish ministerHere comes the cavalry!

The average Spaniard doesn’t leave the family home until the age of 30. So Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is proposing a new £250 monthly voucher for 18-35-year-olds, to encourage them to rent their own homes.Although British children leave home earlier than most Europeans (24, on average) we, too, are slowing down. Around 3.5 million young adults in the UK now live with their parents, an increase of a third in a decade. This is generally thought to be a bad thing, caused by exorbitant housing costs.But what if there’s more to it than just economics? What if children are staying at home because – whisper it – they actually like living with their parents?It’s not impossible, the way it once was. Previous generations of parent were almost ideologically opposed to getting chummy with their children. The sons of the ruling classes were systematically removed from the home at seven, lest they should grow too attached to their mothers. Separation was thought to be character-building. Even in the most loving families, the ide between young and old was clearly demarcated by authority – the absolute rule of the parents.Since the Sixties, each generation of parents has further loosened its collar. Rules of intergenerational decorum that once seemed cast iron have been bent, and then broken, and then tossed aside. My own parents, though exceedingly relaxed and bonhomous for their time, drew the line at letting boys stay over. When I was 21, a boyfriend hitchhiked all the way from Newcastle to London to see me. “How wonderful!” said my dad, ushering him in. “We’d better put a tent up in the garden.”My cohort of parents has largely jettisoned that rule. Indeed, the traditional cry of “My house, my rules” seems to be fading out altogether. Children are increasingly treated as equals – albeit truculent and ignorant equals – whose voices should be heard.The results of this experiment are mixed: no one could claim that the nation’s children appear much happier or more well-behaved for it. But they do seem to enjoy the company of their parents – and vice versa. Several surveys have found that, despite the stresses of lockdown, most families have relished spending more time together since the pandemic began.Far from being a sign of failure, living with your parents denotes a kind of success. After centuries of struggle, families may finally be learning to get along.Uniquely among the human race, I have never watched The Sopranos. I’m sure it’s as good as everyone says, but I find our cultural fascination with the mafia irksome. I can’t buy into the idea of violent thugs being brilliant strategists, or full of hidden depths.Sure enough, the reality is gratifyingly stupid. Court papers filed in New York reveal that members of the Colombo crime family have been conducting extortion rackets by text message, leaving a juicy digital trail for detectives. According to one former mobster, it’s a generational problem: “Everything is on the phones with them!” But one of the texts – “Hey, this is the 2nd text, there isn’t going to be a 3rd” – was sent by a 56-year-old knuckle-dragger.

Further claims against the BBC being brought by victims of Bashir’s deceit are still being negotiated. It is understood the BBC is working its way through a number of claims, including legal actions brought by former journalists who had worked on Panorama alongside Bashir. The final bill, including legal costs, could stretch into the millions.Bashir had paid Mr Wiessler £250 to produce mocked-up bank statements which were then used to gain the trust of Earl Spencer, Princess Diana’s brother. Earl Spencer then introduced his sister to Bashir, leading to the Panorama interview in which Princess Diana complained of her husband’s adultery.The extent of Bashir’s deceit was laid bare in a devastating report published in May by Lord Dyson, a former Master of the Rolls. It prompted the BBC to issue humiliating apologies to Mr Wiessler and also to Prince William and Prince Harry.After five months of negotiations, the BBC has now settled its dispute with Mr Wiessler. He always maintained he was made the scapegoat with the BBC preferring to protect Bashir and its own reputation. Tim Davie, the BBC’s director general, finally apologised in the wake of the Dyson review.Mr Wiessler’s lawyer, Louis Charalambous of Simons Muirhead Burton, said: “Mr Wiessler is relieved that the BBC has now matched the director-general\u0027s fulsome apologies with appropriate financial compensation for the wrongs done to him and the profound impact they had on his and his family\u0027s life.“It is important to my client that the BBC has acknowledged that he acted properly and responsibly throughout.”In a statement, the corporation said: “We are pleased that the BBC and Mr Wiessler have reached an agreement. We would like to repeat our full and unconditional apology to Mr Wiessler for the way he was treated by the corporation in the past. We also apologise to Mr Wiessler\u0027s family.“Mr Wiessler acted with complete integrity, including in raising his concerns at the time and we are sorry that these were not listened to.”Mr Wiessler previously said that his business had folded as a result of being blacklisted by the BBC.In the explosive interview broadcast in Nov 1995, Princess Diana complained that there were “three of us” in her marriage, in reference to the Prince of Wales’s affair with Camilla Parker-Bowles, and also questioned her husband’s suitability as king.Lord Dyson’s review criticised the methods Bashir used to secure the exclusive and also suggested the BBC had failed to uphold “governance, accountability and scrutiny”.Bashir had denied the faked bank statements were used to gain Earl Spencer’s trust. He quit the BBC to follow a lucrative career in commercial television, firstly in the UK and then in the US, before rejoining the corporation as religious affairs correspondent in 2016. He resigned days before the publication of the Dyson review.More from NewsBoris Johnson should yield to the eco-mobs, says Scottish ministerHere comes the cavalry!

Not just because it reaffirmed the deputy Labour leader’s cloddish credentials, nor even that Sir Iain Duncan Smith was afterwards attacked with a traffic cone by some of her knuckleheaded supporters.No, what must really grate for Ms Rayner is that what was originally intended as a slur to galvanise the support of foaming-at-the-mouth Labour activists has actually done the opposite and brought the Conservatives together.I was struck by how many delegates in Manchester this week were literally wearing the insult as a badge of honour. After ConservativeHome chief executive Mark Wallace tweeted that he had an “exclusive supply of “Tory scum” badges, Dehenna Davison, the Tory MP for Bishop Auckland, led the stampede. If Conservative Campaign Headquarters had any sense, they’d be firing up the production line on a new range of T-shirts, mugs and tea towels as we speak.Like the Vermin Club of the 1940s, accidentally formed by Right-wingers after Aneurin Bevan described Tories as “lower than vermin”, Conservatives are rightly embracing their scum status. Of course, being called Tory scum is nothing new, but the reaction to it has changed as dramatically as the face – and demographic – of the party.While it may have been an appropriate obloquy to lob at the likes of Alan B’Stard or Harry Enfield’s Tory Boy, as the daughter of a stonemason who grew up on a Sheffield council estate, MPs like Ms Davison don’t wear it quite as well. And neither did James Brokenshire, the former secretary of state for Northern Ireland and for communities and local government who died of lung cancer on Thursday, aged 53.Described by all who met him as a thoroughly decent, unfailingly polite and hugely dedicated man in politics for all the right reasons, the mild-mannered father-of-three could not be further from the “scum” brush with which Rayner has tried to tar all Tories. Again displaying her trademark brass, even she was forced to admit that “he cared deeply about his work and public service” in a rare straying from the shallow end of her cerebral cortex.The ugly truth for the Opposition is that the Tories no longer resemble anything close to the “nasty party” Mrs May warned about in 2002.By 1997 and after 18 years of Tory rule, the Conservatives had acquired such a bad reputation that even William Hague was forced to admit in his first speech to the Tory party conference as its leader that the party had become “ided, arrogant, selfish and conceited ... out of touch and irrelevant”.When the former Prime Minister, then party chairman, made her controversial remark five years later, she was not only referring to old-fashioned views on social issues like gay marriage but also a perception that the Tories expected the poor to digest paving slabs.Fast forward nearly 20 years and we now have Boris Johnson’s wife, Carrie, admitting she has been “moved to tears” over LGBT hate and the big-spending Prime Minister facing criticism for doing too much to help those hit hardest by the pandemic. Having agreed to a 1.25 per cent increase in National Insurance to claw back the multi-billion-pound cost of Covid, Mr Johnson has managed to reposition the Tories as the “party of the NHS” (if not low taxes).So while some in the party may decry the destruction of Thatcher’s anti-tax and spend economics, at least the milk-snatcher side of her legacy appears to have finally been expunged.The only question that remains is, at what cost? Some of the most interesting polling to have come out of conference was Opinium’s survey about the electoral centre ground for the Social Market Foundation think tank. As well as revealing that Conservatives had grown much more worried about inequality, the survey found that fewer Tories were now in favour of cutting red tape on business.Showing a significant shift in attitudes on economic issues, the polling found that in 2016, some 48 per cent of Conservative voters said that government should “make it as easy as possible to run a business by removing regulations and rules.”. Now only 27 per cent of Tories support that position.Meanwhile, the percentage of Tories who say that business will find a way to make money despite government interventions has risen from 26 per cent to 34 per cent.Five years ago, more than three- quarters (78 per cent) of Tories said that “people should be able to earn whatever they want as long as they pay the amount of tax they legally owe.”. Now, that is down to 55 per cent, with more than a quarter (28 per cent) arguing that society must not become “too unequal” as the “super rich live in a different world to the underclass”. (In 2016, just 15 per cent of Tories were worried about inequality).While Mr Johnson’s new “heir to Blair” centrist offering may well be in tune with an electorate that has moved Leftwards on economic questions, he ignores the concerns faced by businesses – big and small – at his peril. As former US President Calvin Coolidge put it: “Don’t expect to build up the weak by pulling down the strong.”What we witnessed from the Conservatives this week was a rather anti-business offering, with Cabinet ministers seemingly lining up to blame the recent shortages on firms’ failure to prepare for Brexit. Accusing businesses of being “drunk on cheap labour”, one senior source insisted it was “a failure of the free market, not the state” that was behind the fuel crisis and empty shelves.Yet the plain truth here is that the Government had been warned months ago about the shortage of lorry drivers behind the current problems, and should have determined that sufficient drivers would be allowed into the country from abroad to fill the gaps. While the appointment of ex-Tesco CEO Sir David Lewis as the Government’s new supply chain adviser is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, that role should have been filled the day we left the EU.Moreover, it should have ensured that the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) – the government body responsible for granting HGV licences – wasn’t sitting on 54,000 unprocessed applications. Since we managed to get a national newspaper out every day of lockdown, what on earth is the DVLA’s excuse for not doing the job taxpayers subsidise? Had someone in Government got, dare I say it, “nastier” with this arms-length organisation then perhaps we wouldn’t be in quite such a mess. It was the same with Public Health England’s shambolic handling of the PPE (personal protective equipment) crisis at the start of the pandemic, which was greeted with a pathetic sort of pandering rather than a properly punchy response.It strikes me as rather contradictory for Mr Johnson to praise the “capitalist energy” behind the vaccine rollout while failing to apply the same no-compromise, private-sector thinking to some of our public bodies that are unfit for purpose.Currently, the only person in Government who is actively seeking to “level up” businesses with a deregulatory Brexit idend is Lord Frost. Armed with the report released in May by Duncan Smith’s Taskforce on Innovation, Growth and Regulatory Reform, “Frosty” appears to be taking no prisoners when it comes to the Northern Ireland protocol as well as the ergence from EU rules that the 52 per cent voted for in 2016. Refreshingly, this straight-talking former diplomat isn’t trying to win a popularity contest either – unlike almost all of his Cabinet colleagues.No one wants to see a return of the nasty party. But if the Tories lose their teeth, not least when it comes to competence in a crisis, then they are in danger of biting the dust.More from NewsBoris Johnson should yield to the eco-mobs, says Scottish ministerHere comes the cavalry!

We like, what do you call it, capitalism.”  George, from Devon, added: “We’re not anti-anything, like all the artists normally are.”In 2017, the artists, who met at St Martin’s School of Art in London in 1967, said Tate never showed their work and never would “because nothing is good enough for them”. The Tate pointed out at the time that the 2007 Gilbert and George retrospective hosted at the Tate Modern was the “largest exhibition ever to be mounted of their art at that time”.Yet Gilbert insisted that it was only because they had mounted a long campaign and “twisted their arms”.“We were never invited. We are never invited to do anything. We always propose it, in Britain especially,” he said.Similarly, they have previously complained that Tate Modern has not shown a single picture of them for a decade or more.The pair, famed for their formal appearance, have lived together in east London since 1968 and often speak of their support for the Tories and Brexit.On their art, they knew as students that they stood apart from their contemporaries.Gilbert added: “They all have formalism - forms - and we never had that, from the first day.

They elect candidates who make claims far more grandiose and sweeping than non-French politicians would dare. And then, when the same politician makes a tiny adjustment to the retirement age, for instance, the French public come out onto the streets and shortly afterwards turf their revolutionary of choice out of office.President Macron is proving a fine example. When he rose to prominence in 2016-17, he was the epitome of the outsider-insider candidate. He may have had the right educational background, but he didn’t even have a party, let alone a set of candidates, until he was well on the way to being anointed President of the Republic.Yet four years on, Macron has been a stable but unremarkable president. The economic and societal problems that France faced before his tenure are as present now as they were then. And as the opportunity to return to the ballot box comes around again in 2022, the French public are once more looking for an available revolutionary to kick the previous one in the traditional indelicate manner.At this exact point, for the past four decades, the exact same story has played out. That is the ogreish story of the Le Pen family.In the 1980s, when President Mitterand needed to split the French Right to remain in office, he actually enabled Jean-Marie Le Pen to look like a serious candidate for the presidency. Not least by making him part of the television debates and cynically sending Le Pen’s ratings soaring.It was an artful if disgraceful move. Certainly, part of the French public liked Le Pen’s Vichy-ite talk, but a larger portion on the Right was put off by it and by everything that Jean-Marie stood for. It is the tragedy of the French Right that Le Pen and his family have continued to be a presence in every election since then.Because each election cycle, the story is the same. The other candidates take into account the Le Pen candidate (nowadays Jean-Marie’s less radical daughter Marine) and spend part of their time trying to subsume and imitate certain of their concerns. Then they warn the country of the dangers of going anywhere near the Le Pen dynasty.Each time, it works. The foreign press gets excited about the prospect of a serious upset in French politics. But the taint of the Le Pens is such that the public will never vote in significant enough numbers to allow one of them into the office of the president.This time, however, it seems possible that the Le Pen family’s disastrous hold on a portion of the French Right may finally be slipping. An alternative has emerged. The author and commentator Eric Zemmour has not even announced his candidacy yet. But already the polls show that if he does run, he will effectively kill off Marine Le Pen as a serious candidate.Polls show her support falling by more than 10 per cent in only a few months, while other candidates of the French centre-Right languish far behind her. Were Zemmour to run, it looks possible that he could go through to the final round as the candidate to stand off against President Macron. That is assuming that Macron himself manages to make it through. Here, certainly, would be a revolution.Zemmour himself is not well known to English readers. Some of his views would be considered seriously radical in British politics. But in France he is a phenomenon. The Jewish son of French-Algerian parents, he spent most of his career as a respected mainstream writer on politics. Then in the past decade or more, he suddenly became a pariah among everyone except a significant proportion of the French public.In a string of books, notably Le Suicide Francais (2014), Zemmour has sought to shatter the consensus of the Parisian intellectual and journalistic class. He wrote about subjects that the public cared about deeply, but which were skated around by France’s intellectual elite. Quite something, given that France’s intellectual class is infinitely braver than our own (to the extent that we have one).French intellectuals and writers have not shied away from the troubling questions of mass immigration, Islamism and more. But it was Zemmour who said many things that the public had not previously dared. He called for halts on immigration, controversially lamented the demographic alteration of the French population, and called for direct measures to counter these changes.His books have sold in their hundreds of thousands. But the price he paid was among his peers. Only recently he lost his job presenting a popular television show for reasons spuriously invented and applied solely to him. He has frequently been taken to court for “hate speech”. Other journalists call him every predictable name. Yet with each assault Zemmour has not just survived but grown.Today he is a celebrity in France. Paris Match recently put him on their front cover because of a photo snatched of him in the sea bathing with his attractive young female assistant. It is a scenario unimaginable in Britain. To even approximate it you would have to imagine Mary Beard papped on the front of Hello magazine with a new squeeze, while considering a run for No 10.So can Zemmour do it? The polls currently suggest that he could. Macron’s ratings have slumped, and though it is likely he will make the final round of the presidential election it is not certain that he will. Meanwhile, other candidates of the French Right are not only lagging in the polls but also have the distinct disadvantage of saying things now that Zemmour said in far stronger terms many years ago.For instance Michel Barnier, the EU’s former Brexit negotiator, is hoping to be the candidate of the French Right. To make himself viable, he has spent recent months calling for a moratorium on all immigration into France for five years. Why would the public vote for this watered-down Right-wingery?Until now the answer was “because you have no other choice. It is either this or the Le Pens. And do you really want them?” But now a candidate has come along who says similar things to what Marine Le Pen says, though with much greater flair and knowledge. And for the first time it seems as though the French Right might have a viable candidate to stand before the public next April without the taint of the Le Pen family dynasty.Will it work? Who knows. Much of the commentariat is getting ahead of itself in France. And by not yet announcing, Zemmour is playing a clever media game of his own. If he did run, he would have to at least consider creating a serious party structure beneath him. Yet that is what Macron did after coming from nowhere before the last election.All that is certain is that if Zemmour even made it through, it would be a political earthquake. Not just in France but across Europe. The EU has survived in recent decades on a technocratic class that occasionally registers deep public concerns, but does little or nothing to address them.Zemmour does not follow in that tradition. With his dislike of the European Union, hatred of the status quo and belief that France can reassert itself as a sovereign power, the French public may go to the polls next time with a chance for serious change. Whether they vote for it, or accept it if they do, will of course be another matter entirely.Douglas Murray is the author of ‘The Madness of Crowds’.

During the wide-ranging interview, the -year-old father-of-one also opened up about his turbulent childhood, which almost included him and his siblings being taken into care after mum Mary was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The MP said he has faced mental health struggle which only became clear to him when a local councillor urged him to seek support. He said: It was an important moment, actually, because I thought, this is visible to other people. Iaposm clearly not happy. My Coyle said he appeared to be completely ing and was out and about in parliament, but the atmosphere in Westminster was febrile as the aftermath of the Brexit vote played out.  Things came to a head when his home, which he shares with his we and young daughter Esme, was targeted. He said: I had somebody break the window, my home, my bedroom window home during the Brexit debate. He added: There’s no way out the back, it’s a brick wall.

As a Northerner from a working-class background, I appreciate the sentiment. I’m usually grateful when someone highlights the lack of working-class voices wherever it may be – but not this time. Growing up on a Bradford council estate, I never imagined myself walking through the BBC’s lush London offices. But I have and I’m proud to say I never felt out of place. I started working on a science documentary at BBC Studios in June this year as a Junior Researcher and I only left last week. Granted, it wasn’t a long spell compared to many there, so my words don’t stem from years of long-enduring loyalty. But my experience was enough to know that I wholeheartedly disagree with Nadine.Do you agree with Tammieaposs comments  Have your say in the comment section below. My BBC bosses offered me a longer contract to stay. I wasn’t pressured to move to London from Bradford even though my production was London-based. They even paid for my train and hotel when I wanted to visit the office. According to Nadine, “ you’ve got a regional accent at the BBC, it doesn’t go down particularly well” - my colleagues from Glasgow, Oldham and Huddersfield might disagree with that. Her comment made me chuckle nevertheless. I, with my strong Yorkshire accent, was hired by an Executive Producer with an even stronger Northern accent. From Barrow-In-Furness to be exact, where he worked as a submarine painter. Nadine also claimed that the BBC is “staffed by people whose mum and dad worked there”.  I disagree, as does Faye Harland of BBC Radio Berkshire who told her Twitter followers that in her -year career at the BBC that she’s “worked with one person who was following in a parent’s footsteps. ONE.” Similarly, Mastermind host Clive Myrie added to the discussion explaining that his mum was a seamstress. But Nadine underestimates the public. We all know that she employed her daughters using public money, as The Mirror discovered back in . She’s trying hard to be relatable but unfortunately just comes across as a hypocrite. The media is a ridiculously competitive industry and it’s primarily a case of ‘who you know’. But Nadine’s accusations against the BBC - I’d even call it a vendetta, miss the wider issue completely and that’s dangerous for us working-class folk. There are many media companies out there guilty of nepotism but she’s completely firing at the wrong target. It’s an industry-wide problem not a BBC one. She’s let her extreme personal bias show. Why did she never throw ITV under the bus  Is she still sentimental from her time on “I’m a Celebrity…”  If Nadine claims she’s a working-class Northerner, why do I feel like I have nothing in common with her  I like to think I’m proof of an industry changing for the better. Nadine needs to refocus her accusations.

That is despite think tanks putting the worst-case estimate at around , to , people. The Joseph Rowntree Foundationhas said the cut risks moving , people including , children below the poverty line. While the Legatum Institute think tank, led by Tory UC architect Baroness Stroud, says the change will hit , Brits who are currently just above the poverty line - including , children. But ministers have no official figure for how many people will be thrown into poverty because they’ve refused to do a formal impact assessment. And questioned by left-wing journalist Owen Jones at the Tory conference, Ms Dorries said: “Nobody. Nobody is.  “No no no, because, no Owen of course not. “Because what we’re doing, what we’re doing is giving people a step out. “By letime skills guarantee, by all the money being invested in the…” - she then walked away with an aide. Analysis by the JRF has found more than , working-age families in Ms Dorries’ Mid Bedfordshire constituency will be affected by the cut to UC and Tax Credits. That includes % of all working-age families with childrenand % of all working-age families without children . Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: “These comments show just how far away the Conservative Party is from the real world. “Charities and foodbanks have been warning for months that taking £, away from millions of families in the midst of a Conservative cost of living crisis will push children into poverty.” The cut officially began yesterday and will kick into payments from next Wednesday. Read more Boris Johnson did not mention it once in his -minute conference speech which was peppered with jokes.Katie Schmuecker of the JRF said yesterday: “The Prime Minister has not had the guts to look the millions of people whose incomes are being cut today in the eye and tell them how they are expected to get through the year ahead. “The Prime Minister’s attempt to strike an upbeat tone is completely at odds with the despair people are feeling and the cost-of-living crisis we are now facing.” Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey was asked the same question as Ms Dorries by Owen Jones. She replied: “Well it was always a temporary uplt, and that’s why no impact assessment was done when we knew it was temporary. “We are investing in the plan for jobs, we’ve also got the household support fund… we want to try and see what’s going on, what it is we can to help people with the skills so they can absolutely take advantage of higher-paid jobs.” Comment MORE ON Nadine DorriesOwen JonesJonathan ReynoldsBoris JohnsonConservative PartyPensionspovertyPoliticsBenefitsTax Credits\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The footballer, who has become a leading food poverty campaigner, urged Rishi Sunak to help poorer households at this monthaposs spending review.He said it was wrong to impose cuts to benefits when families arenapost in a stable situation and warned that axing the £,-a-year uplt could see child food poverty rise to one-in-three children. Speaking after collecting an honorary degree for his work battling child poverty, Marcus spoke of how much an extra £-a-week would have meant for his family. He told BBC Breakfast: “Whether it’s that little bit extra of food and drinks that are in the house, that’s the dference it makes, but also just the happiness and the stress relief that would have been on my mum and my older brothers and sisters.  It would have been huge, it would have been a lot more calm in the household. I have used this saying a lot, but it’s one less thing for parents to worry about.” He went on: “The cost of living has definitely increased... It reminds me of my situation when I was younger, to be fair. You have got to decide between whether you’re going to eat or whether you’re going to be warm in the house. These are decisions that you don’t want people to go through, let alone children ... Of course it’s something that we are going to have to find an answer to - and quickly because people are out there and they need the meals.” In an appeal to the Chancellor, he said: “Please let now be a time to level up and support our most vulnerable.The England and Manchester United player used his speech at the University of Manchester ceremony at Old Trafford to highlight how the Governmentaposs cut meant millions of families across the UK lost a leline.He said it was bittersweet to accept the award the day after the Government snatched £-a-week from the poorest households. Marcus, , told guests: “We need to work together to find a long-term, sustainable route out of child food poverty. Itaposs time that representatives got out into communities like mine. Itaposs time they saw first-hand the true measure of struggle.” His calls were backed by Labour leader Keir Starmer who accused ministers of “turning on the poorest in our society” as the UK emerged from the coronavirus pandemic.“I think what he said is very, very powerful,” Mr Starmer told the BBC. “Marcus Rashford is right to draw attention to it. It comes - this cut - at the worst possible time because prices are going up, whether that’s food or fuel or energy prices, and this is going to drive families and children into poverty. For the Government to turn on the poorest as we come out of the pandemic is just so wrong.” Transport Secretary Grant Shapps praised the footballer as a fantastic advocate and said the Prime Minister had spoken to him in the past. But he defended the decision to axe the temporary UC uplt as it was for a limited period for coronavirus. Coronavirus has come to an end, he told the BBC. Mr Shapps added: If you wanted to carry on with that uplt, you need to find £ billion a year from somewhere. Inevitably that means taxing people on their PAYE, maybe putting the cost of fuel up even more, even though itaposs at record levels, or something . So nothing is free when youaposre making these decisions. And of course, governments have to make all of these judgments to try to make things stack up.

Here we explain what the Pandora Papers areTony Blair was among the highest profile names to appear in the Pandora Papers Image: GettyByHarry Thompson:,  Oct | comments The Pandora Papers are the latest and greatest in a series of major leaks relating to the shadowy underworld of offshore tax havens and people who use them.The leaks shed light on the activities of some of the worldaposs richest and most powerful people, after work by over  journalists from  media organisations in  countries sted through nearly  million documents from  dferent offshore service companies. The investigation, which has thrown up the names of dozens of world leaders and hundreds of public officials, was run by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalistsin Washington DC and was spearheaded in the UK by BBC Panorama and .The data, which amounted to . terabytes, does not necessarily imply that those discussed have done wrong, but rather lts the lid on the prolic use of offshore accounts. They raise a iety of questions about how the super-wealthy shield their assets, taxation, evasion, and money laundering and are potentially embarrassing for current and former leaders and public figures who may have in the past criticised similar practices. Who are some of the biggest names involved In the UK, perhaps the highest profile figure is Tony Blair and his we Cherie, who did not have to pay £, of stamp duty on a London property after acquiring the offshore firm that owned it.There is no suggestion the pair tried to avoid tax and the purchase was legal. In a statement, the couple said the transaction had been completed “in a normal way through reputable estate agents,” themselves having “nothing whatever to do with the original company nor those behind it”. They added they had “never used offshore schemes either to hide transactions or avoid tax”. The Queenaposs crown estate has also drawn attention during the findings, after it was revealed it had paid  million to the family of Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev, over the period of two decades infor part of their London property portfolio. The crown estate has since launched an inquiry.The files are also purported to include revelations regarding a number of Conservative party donors. According to , donor Viktor Fedotov co-owned a company once accused of playing a part in a major corruption scandal. Mr Fedotovaposs lawyers said there is no evidence whatsoever of any wrongdoing.Elsewhere, other high profile cases include the King or Jordan, Abdullah al-Hussein, whose  million property empire hidden through offshore accounts has been exposed.

Numerous times me and Harry have been out and they’ve just gone, ‘What do you mean, nanny  That’s not nanny, that’s mummy!apos Tracy, who lives in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, tells the Mirror. Harry’s laughing his head off and says, aposI know she looks young, but she is my nanapos.

Itaposs a le the young grandmother didnapost dream was possibly when she fell pregnant in March , having met her future husband just months earlier at a working menaposs club in Coventry.Get the biggest news delivered to your inbox.for the Mirroraposs free newslettersThe revelation came as a big surprise to her parents, whom she admits were disappointed but vowed to support hershe decided to keep the baby. Straight away dad said, aposWellTrevor’s man enough to get you pregnant then he needs to be man enough to face your familyapos, she recalls. So Trevor and my dad met for the first time when I found out I was pregnant - probably not the best meeting of all time! Trevoraposs parents were both Catholic and Tracyaposs mum was religious, so the couple were urged to stand up to their actions and decided to keep the baby. However, while their immediate family were supportive, other relatives shunned the pair.  Tracy was hauled into a classroom by a concerned teacher and even taken to an abortion clinic for guidance by her school. Having decided to go ahead with the pregnancy, she was transferred to a specialist school so she could continue her education while preparing for their new arrival. Of course we had people say, ‘They wont stay together, it’s not love, they’re just children’, she says. There were family members who wouldnapost talk to us and thought we were a bit of a disgrace. We went through quite a lot up until having the baby. You lose your friends ... it was quite dficult really. Tough start to le as a young mum After welcoming baby Wyatt into the world, the couple rented a home in Coventry to start their le together. Money was tight. Tracy was raising their child on a £-a-week allowance, while Trevor worked for the council. It was tough, probably the first  years was a real struggle, says Tracy. We’d had our first child, we’d moved into what Iaposd say now was a real dump. It was a rented house, we couldn’t use the main living room. The landlord decided that our front room would be his storage area for other properties. Trevor says there were rats the size of cats - we certainly had mice! Taking up a job as a carer, Tracy worked nights to fit around the familyaposs schedule and studied for her exams in the evenings. In  they got married, with Wyatt stepping up as a page boy. The following year, when Tracy was  and Trevor was , they had their second child, Kaine. Tracy says the two boys were pretty much all we could afford but the couple did their best to give them a good le We had nothing but they had absolutely everything growing up, she adds. aposHarry loves to confuse people by yelling Nan!apos Rising up the ranks at work over the years, Tracy built up a healthy salary and the family were eventually able to move into their own home. Entering his teenage years, Wyatt was a talented footballer and had trials at West Bromwich Albion - but his hopes were cut short by an injury at .  Two years later, when he called his parents together for a chat, Tracy recognised the look on his face instantly. We were a little bit disappointed when we found out he was having a baby at , she admits. I suppose we didn’t want that for our children. I said, aposOh goodness, what are you going to do  We’ll support you. Of course we’d have supported them either way, we’d be hypocriteswe didn’t! It was just that we wanted a little more for them as children. But Wyatt’s a great dad. The couple have since welcomed seven grandchildren - Wyatt has Harry,  Hope,  Oliver,  Arloe, six months, while Kaine has Carter,  Isabelle, eight months, and his partneraposs son Oscar, . Tracy admits they get odd looks from strangers all the time but sees the funny side. Even yesterday I was running around the hills at Wyatt’s with the kids. I was like, ‘Donapost run, nanny can’t keep up!apos she says. You can see people’s reactions, they just look over. Harry loves to wind people up by deliberately yelling aposNanapos in public, while he also calls Trevor aposPapsapos. People will look around like, ‘What do you mean, is that what he calls his dad ’ Tracy laughs.  Nonetheless, being young grandparents has its upside. The close-knit family will often go out together and Tracy says they have more energy to play with the little ones. It’s strange because we’ve got such a great family dynamic, she says. We’re all very close - I donapost knowthat’s the age factor. If we go on a night out, we go out with our boys and their partners and their friends. It’s very social. We’ve got goals in the garden and lots of toys for the grandchildren, she adds. You’ve got that energy to spend with them because you are younger. aposLe is what you make of itapos Tracy says that despite having a successful career and raised a loving family, the couple have been frowned upon for many years. People will say, aposOh we’re having our first grandchildapos and they’re in their fties. I say, aposThat’s lovely, Iaposve got seven, it’s great being a grandmaapos, she says They look at me and go, aposYou’re not old enough to be a grandma, let alone sevenapos. You almost feel like you’re being taken back to that stage [of being a young mum] again. People are still looking at you as le goes on because they almost calculate it - you can see them thinking about it in their head, going, aposI wonder how old she wasapos. Having been a young mum and helped her son when he became a dad at , she has some encouraging words for anyone  going through pregnancy at an early age. It’s about thinking it’s not the end of the world. Le is what you make of it, she says. Keep going at what you want in le. Everything is still achievable. We never thought we’d buy our own house, we were in a council house in a council estate. Now we have two homes - we rent one out, have a nice sized house we live in. We both have cars and drive.

Out of control infection figures forced the government to cancel Christmas last year having ignored scientistsapos advice to lockdown early and hard in the autumn. As spring approached, months of lockdown, the vaccine rollout and immense amounts of effort from NHS staff began to pay off. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Deaths dropped into the single figures on some days while cases plummeted to one-to-three thousand a day. But the picture is altogether gloomier now and there are concerns that it could get worse.Since the start of summer when infections shot up, fuelled by Euro  crowds and eased restrictions, cases have remained above the mid-,s daily.That puts the UK at the top of the European charts, recording around , more cases per day than Russia in second place. While comparable Western countries like France, Italy and Spain are all currently at less than % of their peak number of cases, the UK is at %. The logic behind opening up the country despite the near certainty that cases would rise was that the roll-out of the coronavirus vaccine - which has now seen about % of the population jabbed twice - would mostly break the link between infections and deaths. For the most part it has. Yesterday  people lost their lives to Covid- in the UK and , new cases were reported. On January , when things were at their most bleak, , died and , positive tests were ed. The data show that as phenomenally effective as the vaccines have been at protecting people from the virus, the shield it offers is not total. More than  million adults in the UK have not been jabbed, meaning they are at much higher risk of catching, getting ill with and dying from Covid-. Department of Health data shows that unvaccinated people aged  and over are almost four times as likely to die after contracting the bug.  With such a large chunk of the population not opting to get vaccinated, the potential for cases and deaths to rise signicantly higher is great, particularly as the cold winter months draw in. Already the NHS is struggling to keep up with demand heightened by the virus.On Wednesday evening at least  ambulances were seen queuing up outside the Royal Stoke University Hospital in Hartshill, Staffordshire.Health bosses admitted that emergency departments across the area were under aposvery signicant pressureapos. The North Staffordshire Healthwatch leader said: The whole of the NHS and the whole of the care system are under extreme pressure. This is a crisis.  The fact of the matter is hospitals are taking huge amounts of ambulance deliveries, but the hospital is actually full at this moment in time. After more than a year and a half of battling the virus, more months of heightened pressure may push exhausted doctors, nurses and NHS staff to breaking point. Some parts of Britain are currently much worst affected than others.Covid is currently most prevalent in Wales , where there is a rate of one cases for every  people, followed by the e ast Midlands at one in  and Yorkshire and The Humber at one in . The South East by contrast has a rate of one in , while the South Westaposs is one in . Researchers working on the ZOE Covid study app found that the virus was running rampant among --year-olds following theto school - with one in  currently infected.Office for National Statistics data show that the infection rate has more then double in two weeks for those in Year  to Year , from .% to .% of the total population of that age group. That means every more than one in every   to -year-old in the UK currently has Covid. Englandaposs Covid- weekly reproduction R number is now estimated to be between . and ..An R number between . and . means that for every  people infected, they will on average infect between  and  other people. Professor Tim Spector, lead scientist on the ZOE Covid study app, said: we can only hope that some kind of herd immunity will kick in and cases will drop. There are several key factors that could make these already concerning figures much worse in the coming months. As with last autumn and winter, colder, shorter days will force people inside where the chances of passing on the virus are much greater. The vaccineaposs effectiveness may wane There is also signicant concern that the efficacy of certain vaccines will begin to wane.The protection against Covid infection offered by the Pfizer jab falters within months of getting a second dose, two new studies have found.Seven months after getting the jab protection from infection had dropped signicantly, the studies showed, meaning the potential to get the virus will be increased for millions of Brits who have had Pfizer. Thankfully protection against severe disease, hospitalisation and death still remains strong at that point. In a bid to protect the more vulnerable, the government has said all over-s, younger adults with health conditions and frontline health and care workers can get a third booster jab. Winter cold and flu is making a comeback Another serious issue that may aggravate the pandemic over the coming months is the flu. Today the government announced the biggest flu jab programme in the NHS’s history, with more than  million people in England eligible for a free vaccine.  Now that mask and social distancing mandates have been dropped, transmissions of the flu is likely to shoot up. Last year cases of the virus remained incredibly low, meaning natural immunity to the potentially deadly disease is likely rock-bottom at the moment. As well as piling more pressure on the NHS, catching flu and Covid at the same time is not only very possible, but signicantly increases the chance of death.By the worst estimates, , people could die from flu alone this year - compared to an average toll of ,.New strains may emerge A continuing point of concern are coronavirus strains, and the potential for another mutation. Earlier this year the Delta iant reached the UKaposs shores and, after months of dipping cases, led to an explosion of infections.The highly contagious Covid iant quickly became the dominant one after it was allowed into the country.The UKaposs high infection count due to Delta and a lack of restrictions, coupled with its relatively high vaccination rate, means it is prime territory for another, potentially more infectious iant to emerge. If the flu, increasing deaths among the unvaccinated and a new strain were to all hit at the same time, the government may have some dficult decisions to make. Last month it outlined a number of measures that could be brought in to keep cases down, such as ato working from home and the mask mandate. If these donapost work however, then yet another winter lockdown has not been ruled out. A senior government source said last month: “We’re going to approach it as we have done through the pandemic: be prepared. If cases become a problem and hospitalisations become a problem then we will act.

The -year-old man identied only as Graham appeared in a TikTok video posted by @novocabelohai on Monday. The clip shows Graham - who suffers with thinning and greying hair - being fitted with a custom hair system at Ruma Hair in Southport, Merseyside. The procedure involved matching his natural hair shade, applying adhesive, patching on the hairpiece and then snipping it to style. The on-screen caption reads: He [Graham] wanted to knowa hair system would knock some years off.  First we colour matched his hair and applied the poly skin base with a glue adhesive then started to snip his new hair into a style, it added. Graham wanted a low maintenance style he could manage easily. I wonder how many years we will take off  The clip has already been viewed over , times, with TikTokers ided over the results. Some say the treatment knocked off a decade, while others reckon Graham should embrace his baldness. One user wrote: I mean he looked  before Iaposd say  now but itaposs amazing what hair does. Crazy transformation! A second viewer said: Tidying up his beard probably made the biggest dference. Someone  commented: Why have people started calling wigs a hair system  Itaposs knocked a few years off but thereaposs no shame in being bald either. Do whatever works for you. In a previous video, Novo Cabelo said bald men should not pay over £ for Grahamaposs treatment. A hair system is a hairpiece constructed from synthetic or high-quality human hair to cover a bald area. Itaposs touted as the ideal non-surgical hair loss fix. Baldness is a normal part of ageing, the NHS says, adding that male and female pattern baldness is usually passed on by genetics.This comes after research found that only a third of people dating someone with hair loss wanted their partner to do something about it – with the vast majority happy with how their partners looked.Comment MORE ON NHSHairstylesHair transplantHair StudioViral\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jayne Nicholls and Alexander Doory were refused at the gate of their Naples flight at Luton Airport over an unclear ruling by the airline.They were told on October  that their fit-to-fly Covid results would not be accepted because they were outside the set time limitations, LeicestershireLive reports. Jayne said: We had our fit to fly test at .am at Colingtonaposs at East Midlands. They asked us where we were going and where we were flying so we thought we were sorted.  But when we got to the gate, we saw a young lad before us getting turned away. He looked really panicky, but he could only speak Italian so we couldnapost find out what was wrong. The -year old and her partner were told that their test result had to be valid  hours to when they landed in Italy - not  hours ahead of their departure time. The flight was scheduled for .am and was due to land .am UK time. The couple were  minutes shy of meeting the policy requirements.  She said: The whole thing was really confusing. It should be called fit-to-land. It wasnapost logical or fair and thataposs the worst thing. Some passengers were given a -minute leeway, but we were still out by  minutes so we were turned away. To me, itaposs just not clear. We lost money for airport car parking, flights plus we had to purchase new flights, new covid tests and new airport parking. Iaposm strong, Iaposm not a stressed-out person - but the situation actually pushed me over the edge. There wasnapost any apologies - we werenapost allowed to ask questions, and there wasnapost anyone that would help us or answer a question. EasyJet says the requirement was put in place by the Italian government. They urge customers to research Covid-related restrictions of their destinations.for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email. A spokesman for EasyJet said: Passengers travelling from the UK the Italian authorities require a negative Covid test result to have been taken within  hours of arrival which unfortunately the passengers didn’t have. Like all airlines, easyJet is required to comply with the requirements of the local authorities in all destinations where we operate. Unfortunately, as the passengers were unable to provide negative test results inside the timeframe required by the Italian authorities, they were unable to travel. “Due to the fast changing, complex and widely ranging Government policies around restrictions in place across Europe, we are alerting customers to the importance of checking current local travel requirements ahead of their flight via email and on easyJet via our Covid- Help Hub, where they can also find access to government website links and the most up to date travel information. We always remind customers that it is their responsibility to ensure they meet entry requirements and will continue to advise them to check the local Government requirements prior to departure. “The safety and wellbeing of our customers and crew is our highest priority.” Comment MORE ON EasyJet\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Maria Thomas, , an administrator from Kidderminster, Worcestershire, felt the wall by her familyaposs dining table was very plain. She wanted to put her own twist on the room, and created an iconic installation on the cheap.Maria developed the concept from ling posts on Pinterest and Facebook - most of which used expensive components.So the mum-of-three decided to create a budget DIY version of the popular look. And social media users have been blown away by the £ hack – that just requires some wood batons, LED lights, paint, glue and nails.  Maria, who is mum to Spencer, , George,  and Ollie, four, also roped in her fiancé, George, , who she says did majority of the hard labour, while she was in control of making the project pretty. “George bought the wood batons and then drew the outline on the wall where we wanted them,” Maria said. “Once he attached the batons with wood glue and a couple of nails from BQ, which cost £, we then had to decide where to place the lights. “We bought some stick-on LED lights from Amazon for £, which are in a smart plug so Alexa can then turn off and on.  He doubled the batons so you wouldn’t be able to see them and then sanded the wood down until smooth. Iaposm thrilled with the finished result and super proud of George. The couple finished off their new ling by adding two coats of aposAlfresco Dusky Blushapos paint from Frenchic at £. This isnapost the first DIY project the pair have sunk their teeth into – in fact, they have spent the last two years sprucing up their home. Maria said: “We have always done dferent bits around the house but I’ve only recently been doing furniture.  “I love making things look pretty – not just my house, but I upcycle furniture and give them a whole new lease of le. “I recently painted all my kitchen cupboards and changed the handles and it’s made such a dference on a really cheap budget. “We have redecorated everywhere in our home and have nearly finished the kitchen.” Maria decided to share her latest project on Facebook, where the post has since racked up , likes so far.  One person called it a “game changer, while someone  added “How nice does this look.” “Wow! So luxurious looking! wrote a third person, adding a clapping emoji. “I generally hate wall ing, I know it’s the trend now but this is something ...luv it!” another user wrote. [sic] A fth user added: “Absolutely beautul!!” “Oh my, we need this!” wrote someone .  Maria has more DIY plans for coming months, including building a media wall with a fire after Christmas. She urges anyone who wants to do DIY for less to take their time and compare prices to get the best deals. The mum added: “It’s scary at first as everything looks awful to start with. “Whilst doing one room, the rest of the house suffers with mess which is the worst bit. “Just take your time to get it right, research ideas and compare prices for items.” Comment MORE ON AmazonBQ PLCproperty newsProperty CareDiyersDIY SOS\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts from our Property Market newsletterSubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jean Bishop, who was known as Hullaposs Bee Lady because she dressed up as the insect to collect money for Age UK, died peacefully on October . In , she received the freedom of the city and was awarded a British Empire Medal in the New Year Honours. At the time she was askedshe would retire and said: There isn’t such a word.” Jean, who was born in Lincs. before moving to East Yorks. when she was young, was just a few months shy of her centenary.  She was known for dressing up in her bee costume and rattling her charity box throughout Hull to raise money for Age UK. The bee costume came about when borrowed it from Age UK and realised her distinctive outfit helped raise a lot of money. Jean later had her daughter make her bee costume with hula hoops and charity shop fabric.  Speaking in  about her work, she said: “I didn’t want to put the costume on at first, but when I did it went down like a bomb.” In the same year, she was recognised by the Queen for her dedication to helping others less fortunate than herself. As she received her medal, the monarch asked Jean why she wasn’t wearing her trademark outfit.  She replied she would, but it would have meant she “would have had to have paid for two seats on the train”.In , Jean was recognised as Fundraiser of the Year at the Pride of Britain Awards, with a bee suit-clad David Walliams presenting her with the award.In , she opened the Jean Bishop Integrated Care Centre, which provides out-of-hospital care for older people in Hull.  The centre, which opened during the week the NHS celebrated its th birthday, was named after her to recognise the impact she had made in her home city. She was only the second woman to be granted the freedom of Hull, following anti-apartheid campaigner Helen Suzman in , and was also celebrated in board game form. Pam Morgan-Davies, CEO of Age UK Hull, said Mrs Bishop was a “complete one-off”. She said: She was groundbreaking, both in the way that she fundraised and how she made people of all ages feel comfortable. “The number of people who remember putting money in her tin when they were little, then they would come up with their kids or their grandkids and say, ‘I used to give you money when I was little’ - she loved that.”  Karl Turner, Labour MP for East Hull, paid tribute to the bright and bubbly woman. He wrote: I am deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Jean Bishop at the age of  this morning. I had the honour of opening the Jean Bishop Centre with her a few years ago. She was a bright and bubbly woman and leaves behind an incredible legacy in our city.

Amid concerns about deliveries of food and fuel, the government is introducing temporary visas for , fuel tanker and food lorry drivers to work in the UK in the run-up to Christmas.It comes as the army has begun helping to deliver fuel to petrol stations as shortages continue, as around  military personnel have been deployed. While the Road Haulage Association, the industryaposs trade body, estimates a shortage of , drivers across the UK, exclusive figures from Recruitment and Employment Confederation have revealed what areas are more affected by the shortage. Overall, the number of vacancies in the UK have increased by nearly a third compared to before the pandemic, from , in February  to , this August.  Among the areas in the UK with at least  vacancies in August, Norfolk saw the largest increase, with figures going up more than three times, from  to . In Wales, the number of jobs posted nearly tripled over the period from  to . Central Bedfordshire followed with a similar increase, from  vacancies in February to  in August while in Cumbria, figures went up from  to .  In contrast, areas like North Yorkshire or Hertfordshire saw a decrease in the number of vacancies for HGV drivers. Adverts went down by more than a third in North Yorkshire, from  to  and by nearly a fth, %, in Hertfordshire.  Vacancies also decreased in Buckinghamshire, from  to  and in Leeds, from  to . The national crisis started in the summer, when supermarkets began to experience empty shelves - partly due to a shortage of lorry drivers. Then in September, BP warned it would have to temporarily close some of its petrol stations, because of a lack of lorry drivers to actually transport fuel to the pumps. Following that announcement, long queues started to appear outside petrol stations across Great Britain, amid fears that petrol might run out. Figures from the Office for National Statisticsshow that nationally, around , people in the UK worked as HGV drivers in the last quarter of .  That went down by % to , in the last quarter of .According to the government, a backlog of HGV driving tests not taking place because of the coronavirus pandemic and an ageing workforce going into retirement are among the causes for the lack of lorry drivers.Figures from the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency show , tests took place in the financial year  , down % from the , tests taken in  . The impact of coronavirus and a lack of long-term investment in the UK’s domestic workforce - with a reliance on overseas labour - are also partly to blame for the shortage.Both the pandemic and Brexit saw many European drivershome - and haulage companies say very few have ed, with new immigration rules a factor. A recent ONS survey shows almost half of the transport and storage businesses that were experiencing recruitment challengesmentioned the reduced number of EU applicants as a factor - the highest of any sector. While the government has offered an emergency visa scheme to help alleviate the problem - which will allow firms to recruit fuel tanker drivers from overseas up to March  - the Times reported, as of Tuesday , only  had applied, although thePrime Minister later said the number was . TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “Everyone who works for a living deserves to earn a decent living.  “But wages and conditions in sectors like logistics have been driven down for years. “That isn’t the fault of migrant workers – it’s the fault of a flawed economic model which relies on holding down workers’ rights and pay. “Short-term visas are an inadequate sticking plaster. If we want to end this supply chain chaos, the government must give workers and their unions more bargaining power to negotiate better pay and conditions. “Worker shortages needn’t be a long-term feature of post-Brexit, post-pandemic Britain. But we need an economy that puts working people’s interests first.” Check your area The data table shows the February  unique postings, the August  unique postings, the July  unique postings and the per centage increase.Wales.%North Wales.%Central Bedfordshire.%Cumbria.%Black Country.%Worcestershire.%Somerset.%Sussex.%Coventry.%North and North East Lincolnshire.%Comment MORE ON Road Haulage AssociationOffice for National Statistics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He has even opened up a new restaurant in London, where a golden burger will set you back £. Also on the menu is fries for £, £ for water and £ for a side of mash. Itaposs no surprise that with Nusret has racked up an impressive net worth from all his success. But how much is he actually worth – and how did he become so rich  What is Salt Baeaposs net worth  Salt Baeaposs net worth is an estimated millionas of . The -year-old was born to a Kurdish family in Erzurum, Turkey. He left school at the age of  to become a butcheraposs apprentice and help with his familyaposs finances. It was during this time he was inspired to become a chef. Although most people will know him from the  meme, this wasnapost where his ambitious career started. In  Gokce moved to Buenos Aires where he worked at a restaurant, and learned more about the meat industry. Then, in , at the age of , he opened his first Nusr-Et steakhouse in the neighbourhood of Istanbul. Soon a Turkish businessman ate at the restaurant, and was so impressed that he invested, meaning Gokce was able to open more locations.In  his fame grew after a video of him preparing food was posted on his restaurantaposs Instagram and Twitter.His confident demeanour and the way he sprinkles salt over his food made the video go viral, and the name Salt Bae became well known.

To celebrate the launch of Zinger Popcorn Bucket - available for a limited time only - we decided to champion people who like to spice things up, including Hannah Murphy, . When she reached a career crossroads in , Hannah struck out on a new adventurous course, and almost a decade on has no regrets about her bold decision. When I was made redundant from my eight-year career as a flight attendant, flying both domestically and between the UK and Japan, I saw it as an opportunity set myself a new challenge, and have new adventures, says Hannah who lives in Southampton with her husband and three children, Angelina, , Archie,  and Adriana, five. At the time I was a single mum of one after my previous relationship ended, and the ‘sensible’ decision would have been to take a - desk job, something stable but didnapost challenge me. That’s just not me though, I have to love what I do and find joy in it every day. Instead, Hannah trained as a fitness instructor and began to incorporate a hula hoop into her training. It wasn’t just a useful exercise tool, great for toning and core strength, it was so much fun. The moment I started hula hooping, I was transported back to my childhood, it was really liberating. As word got out about Hannah’s hula hooping prowess, friends and family began to ask for lessons, followed by requests from local schools for Hannah to come in and teach children how to hula hoop.  It snowballed and before I knew it, I had so much interest in hula hooping fitness classes, I had to train other instructors to help me. I went on to create a training programme called Globe Fit and today I have teachers all around the world, from Australia to America, all teaching my programme. I love teaching hula hooping, particularly adults, because they might start off a bit self-conscious and inhibited but soon their inner child is released and they just go for it! I’ve taught people aged from teenagers to eighty-year-olds. Last year, I hosted the first ever world hula hooping championship, which will be taking place again later this year. After launching the UKaposs first hula hooping championship in , which took place in Fareham, Hampshire, Hannah decided to go global in . Not even a pandemic could stop her with the event going virtual and around twenty-five competitors, women and men of all ages and abilities, taking part from as far afield as India, America and Australia. I had a  of four judges, including John Parnell aka Hoop Guy who appeared on Britainaposs Got Talent in . Competitors submitted videos of themselves performing with their hoop, and were marked on everything from skill to tricks they could do, with the  judging the videos.

The trucker was captured on camera slowly driving backwards over the track as a train approached at Wedgwood Station, in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, on Thursday. The HGV can be seen making it most of the way across the crossing before the gate came down on top of the truck - ripping the barrier clean off. It caused major disruption to passengers travelling on the West Coast main line between Crewe and Stoke as the route had to be closed.  Engineers worked for one-and-half hours to fix the barrier by pm following the incident, which happened at .pm. Network Rail today released the heart-stopping footage and warned motorists never to reverse over level crossings. James Dean, Network Rail’s West Coast South route director, said: “It’s almost unbelievable that this lorry driver decided to reverse over this level crossing, putting not only them but also the oncoming train and its passengers in danger.  “It’s not advice we usually need to give but now we must also stress to motorists to never reverse over a level crossing as you won’t see the warning lights. For those driving in the correct direction, our advice remains as it always has – although it might be tempting to jump the lights or race through the barriers – don’t - please just wait.” Comment MORE ON West CoastRailways\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I was actually on my lunch break at work, so I shared the news straight away with all my colleagues!” Sarah is one of  million people who have received that exciting news telling them theyaposre a winner, since The Health Lottery launched  years ago, giving away £ million in prizes in that time. And the timing was perfect for the mother and grandmother from Oldham. Sarah turns  soon, and the £, windfall means she can really celebrate her half-century milestone in style. With partner Darren also reaching that golden birthday this year, Sarah plans to invest her winnings in a top-notch sunny holiday.The Health Lottery turns  this month. In that time,  million players have netted £ million worth of prizes - and theyaposre not the only winners. The Health Lottery is committed to supporting communities that need it most, and so far £ million has been raised for over  grassroots projects throughout Great Britain, supporting issues such as dementia, loneliness, learning dficulties and mental health. There are five main draws every weekeach with a jackpot of £,.

My partner and I both turn the big - this year, and we’re treating ourselves with a holiday of a letime to Mexico. We will certainly be enjoying a margarita or two on The Health Lottery.” And itaposs not just the winners that benefit, as money raised through The Health Lottery helps fund vital local community projects. £ million has been raised so far, for over  grassroots projects throughout Great Britain, supporting issues such as dementia, loneliness, learning dficulties and mental health.This is one of the reasons Sarah plays The Health Lottery online. “I have been playing The Health Lottery once a week since , picking two lines,” she explains.My nan had Alzheimer’s, so it is really important for me to support these projects. They are empowering the most vulnerable communities and tackling health inequalities around Great Britain. It is fantastic that I can give back a little to these wonderful projects by simply buying a ticket.” I asked my we to check all the numbers! For Nuneaton Rugby Club player, Allan Taylor, finding out heaposd scooped £, in last yearaposs New Year’s Day draw was a great way to kick of .  “You never think it is going to be you,” said father-of-three Allan, . “I couldn’t believe it was true! I asked my we and girls to all check my numbers. We wanted to make sure it was the real deal before we could properly celebrate! They were ecstatic about the news. It has allowed us to get that long weekend in Dublin that we have always wanted. I really fancy going on the Guinness factory tour and learning a little more about my favourite stout.” One of the reasons Allan plays is because it allows him to give something back. Playing The Health Lottery supports so many great causes. We are a family that has received some great support over the years from local causes. It is wonderful that we can give back to these grassroots projects simply by buying a Health Lottery ticket.” The size of the prize hasnapost sunk in yet! When Sue from Chesterfield got a phone call from The Health Lottery asking her to check her online Health Lottery account - something Sue hadn’t done in a while - what she saw changed her le. She had won £, in a second chance draw. “To be honest, I’ve been thinking about what I need,” said Sue, when asked what sheaposll spend the money on. I barely spend money on myself normally so this is a chance to fix up some things that need done. The garden. The house. Things like that. The size of the prize hasn’t sunk in yet so who knows what will be left. Maybe enough for a car  A holiday  It’s exciting to think about.” The former community worker says that playing The Health Lottery is a continuation of her work to support others. She said: “I’ve always been keen on helping people. I’ve been brought up that way. So I’d happily spend £ on a Health Lottery ticket because I know that it genuinely helps people. I’ve seen some of the good causes that are supported. Obviously I play the lottery for the prizes, as we all do, but the sense of supporting your community really sweetens the win.” It’s been a great moment to share In August , the News UK finance team syndicate scooped a fantastic £, after matching  balls, plus the bonus ball. Formed of eight players, the Peterborough-based team have been playing The Health Lottery for three years now – and were delighted to bag their first big win.  Syndicate leader Gary Smithdale said: “When I answered the call, the news came as a great surprise – I couldn’t wait to tell everyone! Some of us have worked together for over  years, so it’s been a great moment to share.” Their big win even inspired a new team name. “What about Sunshine  ” mused team member Margaret Lenton. “The sun’s shining on this lucky day, and there’s eight of us!”It is very important to support the local charities that benefit from Health Lottery salesKathy Brown, a Buckinghamshire Council Business Support Officer from Aylesbury, was delighted when she found out she had won £, in The Health Lottery’s draw online. Amazingly, this is the second time she has won a tidy sum by playing The Health Lottery, although her recent winnings dwarf the £ won previously. Big hearted Kathy says a big reason she plays is to support local causes and community projects: “In this day and age I think it is very important to support The Health Lottery and all the charities that are supported.”  While she plans on enjoying spending much of her winnings herself, she said she will make sure her daughters benefit too, selflessly spreading the joy to her family.

He was embroiled in a long-running legal battle with Madeleine’s parents after writing a book accusing them of covering up her death, something they have always strenuously denied.Now Amaral has written a second book - Maddie: Enough Lies - in which he says prime suspect Christian Brueckner is innocent.He claims German prosecutors have turned the convicted paedophile into a “man-made Frankenstein”. Amaral, , accuses them of doing a botch job as part of a “discredited desire” to link Brueckner the crime. And he says Brueckner has been made the prime suspect because of a “biased” German investigation. In his -page book, which is set to be published next week, he also makes fresh slurs against Kate and Gerry McCann. Last month he repeated  allegations accusing the couple of being the “main culprits” for their daughter’s disappearance. The McCannaposs have always vigorously denied any involvement in Madeleineaposs disappearance.  Amaral cruelly told German newspaper Bild he has “no doubt” Madeleine’s kidnapping was staged as part of a cover-up.

And last night the film, called Spencer, got its UK premiere with Twilight actress Kristin Stewart taking on the coveted role of Diana. Set in , the film documents the late princess spending three days with the royal family at Sandringham, where she decides to finally end her turbulent marriage to the future King. The filmaposs title takes its name from Dianaaposs family name of Spencer. Before she was married, she was known as Lady Diana Spencer. But who is part of the Spencer family now, and what do they do  Here we reveal all... The model newlywed  Among the most well-known of the current crop of Spencers is Dianaaposs niece and Princes William and Harryaposs younger cousin, Lady Kitty Spencer.The -year-old hit the headlines in July when she married wealthy businessman Michael Lewis, , in a stunning three-day wedding in Italy.She wore a series of gowns by Dolce  Gabbana with her main dress, which had an intricate floral lace design, a high neck, long sleeves and puffed shoulders, reportedly taking six months to create. The couple exchanged their vows in front of celebrity guests that included singer Pixie Lott, and Idris Elbaaposs we Sabrina at the Villa Aldobrandini in Rome.Kitty is Earl Spenceraposs oldest child and grew up in South Africa with her mother Victoria. She read psychology at the University of Cape Town and has modelled for brands including Dolce  Gabbana and Bvlgari.

She also scored invites to the wedding of her cousins William and Harry and her Instagram account shows her at fashion shows in cities such as London and Milan.Although the monarchy has now changed to put sons and daughters on an equal footing in terms of ascending to the throne, British primogeniture law has not been changed to peers such as dukes and earls. So her father Earl Spenceraposs title will go to his eldest son Louis rather than Lady Kitty. Glamorous twins  Sometimes joining their sister Kitty at events and parties are twins Lady Eliza and Lady Amelia Spencer.They were born in  and grew up in South Africa and were just five when their late aunt Diana died.Earlier this year, they gave a rare joint interview in Tatler where they shared fond memories of their incredibly warm, maternal and loving aunt. Speaking about Dianaaposs death in , Eliza said: As a child, I realised the enormity of the loss for my father and family. It was only later that I came to understand the signicance of the loss of her as a figure in the world. We always just knew her as our aunt. Growing up in South Africa, I really had very little idea of how signicant she was in the world until I was much older. Curiously, Amelia didnapost attend cousin Harry wedding to Meghan in , but Eliza was there. Both twins are models and are represented by Storm Management.Prince Harry-lite Another member of the Spencer family is Kitty, Amelia and Elizaaposs younger brother Louis, who has been dubbed aposthe worldaposs most eligible bachelorapos as well as aposPrince Harry liteapos. He is a fair few years younger than his royal cousins William and Harry but in the past, it has been reported that he is close to them.Louis, , is said to be apossuper privateapos but earlier this year, he played a starring role in sister Kittyaposs wedding, as he walked her down the aisle.One day he will inherit the familyaposs ,-acre Althorp estate in Northamptonshire as his father, Earl Spenceraposs heir apparent - despite having three older sisters. Kitty previously said: Weaposve grown up understanding that itaposs Louis to inherit, and Louis will do an incredible job. Head of the family  The current head of the Spencer family and holding the title of Earl Spencer is Dianaaposs younger brother Charles.He is the custodian of the familyaposs Althorp estate in Northamptonshire and has been married three times. As well as having children Kitty, Eliza, Amelia and Louis, he also has younger children Edmund, Lara and Charlotte.Charles counts the Queen as one of his godparents and was extremely close to Diana - delivering a moving eulogy at her funeral in Westminster Abbey in . However, when his eldest daughter Kitty wed this summer, there was reportedly no sign of her father at the nuptials.An insider claimed the Earl may have skipped his daughteraposs big day due to a shoulder-related injury. A source told MailOnline at the time: Charles recently suffered an injury and perhaps that will be the reason for him not travelling, but it is just easier for everyone that he is not there. Prince Charlesaposs ex  Lady Sarah McCorquodale is Dianaaposs eldest sister and even briefly dated Prince Charles as a teenager. She married Neil McCorquodale in  and they have three children - Emily, George and Celia. Diana was said to be close to Sarah and she sometimes accompanied her on engagements as a lady-in-waiting. After Dianaaposs death, she accompanied Prince Charles alongside her other sister Jane to bring the princess back to the UK.In , she attended the christening of Harryaposs son Archieaposs christening and was at the unveiling of a statue of Diana in July.Royal wedding star Lady Jane Fellowes is another of Dianaaposs older sisters and is married to Robert Fellowes - a former private secretary to the Queen. She has three children - Laura, Alexander and Eleanor - and gave readings at the funeral of her sister as well as at nephew Prince Harryaposs wedding in . She too was at Archieaposs christening and the unveiling of the Diana statue.Comment MORE ON Princess DianaPrince Charles, Prince of WalesRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

However, it is unlikely that low areas will experience snowfall.  He said: Likely areas to be affected are the Scottish mountains as well as higher ground in northern England and northern Wales. Low areas are unlikely to see any. It’s quite normal for this time of year. It comes as publications say a White Halloween is now feared, with odds slashed by bookies.  We better make the most of any balmy temperatures because the end of October looks set to be a big freeze, so much so that we make it odds on for snow to fall this month in the UK, said Coralaposs Harry Aitkenhead. We make it a - chance that this winter goes into the record books as the coldest the UK has ever had. Last week a blanket of snow hit Scotlandaposs highest peak with around cm falling on Ben Nevis.  Before the cold snap arrives on lower ground, Met forecaster Clare Nasir said that the country is having exceptionally mild weather this week. The air across the UK has been emersed by tropical conditions and what that means is that it is exceptionally mild as we head into Friday andyou catch some sunshine, feeling very warm throughout Friday afternoon, she said. Through the day we will see some sunshine for Wales, the Midlands, eventually northern parts of England and the West Country, always more rain towards the South East. Then this area of rain continues but it is mainly light rain, drizzle for the southern parts of the Highlands. To the north we see some brighter skies but the reason why we continue to see that rain warning for western Highlands and Argyle is because another pulse of rain will push up later on from the South West. Always a breeze in the north but the key thing about the weather like I said are the temperatures of C to C throughout the afternoon even where you see that cloud. UK forecast for the next  days Today: Rain continuing in the northwest but tending to ease, and clearing from Northern Ireland. Elsewhere, fog and low cloud slowly clearing to allow some warm sunshine for many, though staying cloudier in the far southeast. Tonight: Rain moving across parts of Northern Ireland and northwest Scotland, heavy at times. South and southeast England turning cooler with fog patches. Otherwise mostly cloudy with spots of light rain. Saturday: Fog lting over south and central England to leave warm sunshine. Cloudier where with rain in far northwest moving across Scotland and into north England whilst easing. Outlook for Sunday to Tuesday: Mainly dry Sunday after patchy drizzle clears the south, some blustery showers across the north. Rain for the northwest Monday but dry for most into the start of next week.

Bride Staci Gibson, , celebrated her marriage to Grant, , on a small budget complete with a registry office ceremony, a white dress and buffet reception.The happy couple from the West Midlands had a Covid wedding which meant that only  people could attend, but this meant that the cost was dramatically reduced.The newlyweds were able to pull off the wedding by using some savvy ideas to cut the cost. For her wedding look, Staci bought her wedding dress from ASOS which, thanks to a promo code, was a bargain at just £. What do you think of this story  Have your say in the comments  She paired the dress with a homemade bouquet, £ Primark heels and accessories from Claireaposs. A friend was able to do her bridal hair and makeup, and another friend who is a baker gted them with a cake. She said: We saved money on the things we thought were unnecessary like favours and gts for the bridal party. Focus on why youaposre getting married and who you want there not the bits no one remembers anyway. Staci added: My friend is a seamstress and she altered my dress for free and she made the girls their bridesmaid dresses. I paid just £ for the material.Even Grant had a discount on his suit, which we bought from Next and used a family discount rather than hire from a wedding shop.The couple even saved money on their wedding rings, as Grant decided to use his dadaposs wedding ring and Staci exchanged her engagement ring that had broken for a new set including an engagement ring and wedding band.  Staci and Grant tied the knot in a local registry office with Staciaposs daughters Morgan,  and Shelby , and the coupleaposs son Jett,  by their side. They invited their guests back to their new house for a reception which included a buffet that Staci and her daughteraposs had prepared earlier that day and second hair decorations. The mum of three said: It only cost £ to get married at a local registry, it looks like a church and the building was perfect for photos.We are glad it was a small wedding with  guests, it was perfect for us, not just for the money we saved, but for how we imagined our day would be.No part of me really wanted a big fancy wedding, it would have been money wasted so I have no regrets on how we did it, It was perfect for us.She added: I did all the food and drink with my daughteraposs on the morning of the wedding, before we got ready. Our friend is a baker and she made our cake as a wedding gt to us, it was beautul. However, one place that the couple were willing to splurge was on the wedding pictures. The photos are our memories of the day and thataposs something you canapost put a price on, we wanted to make sure we had the photos to look back on our special day. After the wedding, the happy couple were shocked to realise that they had received more money in gts than what they spent on the wedding.Their generous family and friends had given them £, meaning they made a profit of £ on the day.Staci said: I was amazedIaposm honest, I opened cards and gts and couldnapost believe it.So many people start married le in debt with a huge bill for the wedding day and we had actually made money from our wedding day.We have amazing family and friends who helped us do things cheaply and who were so generous with their gts. We so are lucky. Staci and Grant spent the money on doing up their new home, which Staci said was the responsible thing to do.She said:I am very money conscious. My dad taught me well in le and said itaposs not how much money you have but what you do with it.A simple wedding isnapost a bad wedding.

The womanaposs furious outburst came as Insulate Britain protesters flocked to dferent roads across the capital to cause traffic disruption today. Several dozen demonstrators spread themselves between Junction  of the M at Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, and busy Old Street in east London. The enraged parent was driving her daughter to class along the M when protesters gathered close to the Enfield junction delayed her school run. As she passed the campaigners - who were sat in a row behind a barrier - the mum wound down her window.  She then called the activists selfish and a disgrace and slammed them for putting their cause above education. She said: Itaposs backing up, all because all you care about is insulating houses. My daughter is late to school, you are messing with childrenaposs education because you are selfish. The mum then starts to drive away when she spots the woman filming the altercation. I hope you got that on camera, she says. The camerawoman then asks the angry mum what she thinks about the demonstrators. I think itaposs a disgrace. An absolute disgrace, she said. Meanwhile, on Old Street protesters were accompanied by aposofficial observersapos following several violent clashes with motorists since starting their nationwide demonstration in September. Met Police are at the scene and said in a statement: We are responding to two protests this morning which are blocking roads.  Activists are disrupting traffic around Old Street roundabout, #Islington. Theyaposre also disrupting motorists at Junction  of the #M. Weaposre on scene and working quickly to get traffic moving. The force added: We know that some activists have used super glue to frustrate our efforts and to delay Londoneraposs even further. We train for these scenarios and have specialist teams on hand to help remove people and make arrests. We will share more information shortly. The activists ignored an injunction put in place to stop them blocking traffic. Just before am this morning an ambulance was photographed as it tried to get past the protestors in Islington. Insulate Britain wants the government to insulate and retrofit homes across the UK to cut climate emissions.  Its members have caused chaos on the M five times in the past fortnight and were threatened with imprisonmentthey ed to the motorway.More than  Insulate Britain campaigners have been arrested at the protests, the Department for Transport said.The blockades have affected Essex, Hertfordshire and Kent since starting on September .Speaking last week to LBC Tracey Mulligan for Insulate Britain said: We have certainly got everybody talking about insulation or avoiding the question of insulation. We have got people considering that our government is legally failing in their duty to protect us and I think weaposre showing that Priti Patel, unfortunately, is trying to scare us with an injunction and that shows her lack of character, not ours. You canapost put an injunction on hunger, you canapost put and injunction on physics, and we are terried for our childrenaposs future and sick of over , people dying each year from the choice of heating or eating. When asked about breaking the injunction, she said: I wouldnapost say we are happy, we are just putting things into the bigger context. We are tired of over seven million people having to choose between heating or eating and we know thataposs going to get worse with the energy crisis that weaposre facing now.

Mum-of-two Cayleigh Davies is one of millions of people who is now £ a week worse off thanks to the Conservative governmentaposs decision to cut the welfare payment.The cut came into force on Wednesday, Birmingham Mail reported. Cayleigh, , said the extra £ a week was hugely important to her and her two kids, aged  and . Things are already hard and we just about get by and that £ extra we got made such a dference, she said. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter I honestly donapost know what Iaposm going to cut back on - probably the childrenaposs bus fares as it isnapost too far for them to walk to school.As well as the income reduction, the prospect of spiralling utility prices is causing big headaches for some people.Tom Trigger, aged , now has his first home after a letime of living with his parents. Iaposve only been in my own place for three weeks so am dreading my first gas and electricity bill as Iaposve been reading about how much theyaposve shot up, he said.Luckily I work as a welder, but my girlfriend is a teacher whoaposs on Universal Credit and thataposs just been reduced by £ a week.But Iaposm not that worried about rising bills yet because I donapost know any dferent. Ask me in a month though and I may tell you something dferent. A -year-old mum of four, who didnapost want to be named, said the rising cost of living had forced her onto anti-depressants.  The woman, who was the victim of domestic violence, said despite working part-time at a major retailer and claiming Universal Credit, she was still close to poverty. I live like a pauper, she said. After Iaposve paid all my bills I have just £ - £ a week to buy food. I only put the heating on when itaposs really cold, otherwise I just put a jumper on Iaposve gone through all my bills and cancelled everything I donapost need and Iaposm very thrty. I got so worried about money, Universal Credit being reduced and all my bills going up that my doctor put me on anti depressants. All of these Universal Credit claimants live in the Woodrow area of Redditch, which has been named as one of Worcestershireaposs poorest areas. In the Woodrow Centre the Community Social Hub has just opened, providing cheap food for struggling families. It is run by mum-of-four Michelle Bridge, aged , who set up one in the Wirrall, Merseyside, which has proved very successful.  Since opening on September , it has seen  households use it - thataposs , people. Michelle fully expects that number to shoot up over the winter. Lots of people were just about managing before the pandemic, and then that happened and their lives fell apart, she said. People lost their jobs, relationships broke down because of lockdown, people had more babies and money got tight. The club is in a shop unit in Woodrow Centre and operates by people paying £ a year membership fees. For that, they get a £ food parcel, comprising food essentials, or they can buy food like bread for p, a big packet of porridge oats for p, as well as other food and toiletries for a fraction of the price theyaposd normally pay in a supermarket. It will get worse over winter as energy bills go up and people realise they havenapost got enough money to buy food, Michelle said. Then thereaposs the ending of that extra £ a week they got on Universal Credit - that will hit people really hard as theyaposve become reliant on over the last  months.  But we are here and will remain here for those who really need us. Kelly Messenger is  and has six children and has started volunteering at the club. Iaposm already struggling to make ends meet, so am dreading winter with everything going up, she said. Because Kellyaposs children are aged three, five-year-old twins, six, seven and eight she is unable to work and is reliant on benefits. She shares custody of them with her partner, but that means she only gets Child Benefit for two of the children as he has it for the others. I used to work in a shop but had to give that up when my youngest children came along, plus I had mental health issues too, she said. Itaposs going to be a tough winter money-wise, but Iaposd never cut things for the kids - all the savings I make will be for myself. The Community Social Hub has been my leline - I love volunteering here and means we can eat healthy meals. Kerry Snow is  and lives in a three bedroom house in Woodrow with her eight-year-old daughter, her grown-up son and his girlfriend and their baby, as well as her -year-old disabled mother.Losing that £ a week Universal Credit is something Iaposve been dreading ever since it was announced it was ending, she said.Thataposs a lot of money to me and my family and will mean making cutbacks - and then all my other bills will go up too. Janet and Phil Williams, both , who were shopping with their grandson, said they were lucky because they were pensioners.Phil, who used to work at Cadburyaposs and gets a private pension on top of his state pension, said: Weaposre lucky, but our daughter and everyone  with children is really going to struggle, especiallytheyaposre on Universal Credit.I feel really sorry for young families now because, eventhey work, they will still see all their bills rise. Local resident June Mitchell, aged , was also thankful that sheaposs a pensioner. I get state pension and also a bit of my ex-husbandaposs pension too, and I live on my own, so Iaposll just about get by, she said. But we should never have voted the Conservatives into power and as soon as thereaposs an election Iaposm voting them out.

Several weeks ago, the couple made a series of appearances around New York and met with political figures, including the cityaposs mayor Bill de Blasio and the US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield.They also visited children at a school in Harlem, where Meghan read them her childrenaposs book, The Bench. During the visit, she wore a vivid burgundy Loro Piana cashmere coat, which is thought to cost around £,, and matching wide-leg trousers, which are reportedly priced at £,.  And royal expert Katie Nicholl from Vanity Fair said this did not make any sense.Speaking on True Royalty TVaposs The Royal Beat, she said: Turning up at an underprivileged school in Harlem in a couture coat that costs more than the combined incomes of most of those parents at the school - it doesn’t make any sense.It just shows them to not be in touch.” Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .Fellow royal expert and author Robert Jobson was also on the programme, and he too agreed. He said: If they’d been shielded by the ‘royal umbrella’, they wouldn’t be falling into so many of these traps, and they’d probably still have a degree of popularity, and a chance to have a voice. I don’t think that in five years’ time people will be listening.”  Last monthaposs whirlwind trip to New York marked Harry and Meghanaposs first public appearances since they quit as senior royals and moved from the UK to Calornia as well as Meghanaposs first appearance in public since giving birth to daughter Lilibet.And according to royal expert and author Duncan Larcombe, the trip could be a sign of things to come from Meghan and Harry. Last week he told Closer magazine : Their stepping-out last week will no doubt be the first of many similar appearances and visits. Harry and Meghan are setting a precedent for their new line of work, and what they have decided they will be.They essentially did a royal visit, like they used to in the UK – just on their own terms and in their own way. “There will no doubt be a lot of meetings at the Palace and talks over how they are going to approach Harry and Meghan’s plans. This visit was a huge two fingers up to the royal family and shows the royal feud is far from over.” The Royal Beat - available on True Royalty TV.

She told the BBC: Weaposve actually been seeing a rise in the number of coughs and colds and viral infections. We are mixing in a way that we havenapost been mixing over the past  months.  During those first lockdowns, we saw numbers of other [non-Covid] infections fall. We think that that was primarily due to the restrictions on meeting up.

Paul Luttrell, , was placed on a ventilator after contracting Covid and it was feared he wouldnapost survive. Three years ago, he was diagnosed with myeloma, a cancer of the blood and bone marrow, that destroyed his kidneys. He was taken ill from Covid during a regular dialysis session and placed in an induced coma. But after defying the odds to recover, he has now given an incredible insight into the continuous delirium that came with being comatose.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here The former builder said he is still struggling to process what he experienced during the -day stretch. In his dream, he was aposkidnappedapos by a gang and fearing for his le at every moment while working as a driver. And as part of his apostortureapos he revealed he was made to work as a aposslaveapos delivering food for Tesco to earn his captors money - and was only given a clapped-out old banger of a van to work in. He said he doesnapost remember anything  until coming around three weeks later. He spent a total of  days in the coma and described the whole experience as apossurreal.apos He said: It was pretty hellish. I did not get to see my family or say goodbye and was put in an induced coma for  days. I remember the dreams so clearly - like crystal. I had been kidnapped by a gang in London who put a hood over my head, chucked me in a car and then took me to a garage. It was a really wet floor but they ripped my shirt and used a defibrillator to try and torture me. They then made me get a job as a Tesco delivery driver but I had to give all my money and wages to them. I only had this crappy van doors hanging off the back but I had to get on with it and earn more money to give straight to them. The leader of the gang was a dwarf who kept demanding aposI want more money.apos I then also started selling acid tabs. It was all so bizarre I donapost know where it all came from. But I was hallucinating and could not escape. They wanted me to look after a prostitute. I remember what she looks like and everything. My job was to protect her from guys getting too frisky with her. The dream went on continuously. The girl was a computer hacker and she worked with other hackers to find out who Banksy was as he was trying to kill the queen. There was a big event in London next to the Thames that had two giant pyramids. There was a film showing that night next to the pyramids that had three words displayed you are dead. I stopped to watch the movie and everything collapsed around me. It was scary stuff. The dreams were so bizarre but so real. I jumped from one place to another. I would hide under my friendaposs house and they would put out smoke signals when it was safe to come out. Paul, of Frome, Somerset, who has five children and two grandchildren, said his family thought they would aposbury himapos after he was put straight into isolation during the dialysis session on July . His oxygen levels had dropped to just  and the last thing he remembers was paramedics arriving dressed in hazmat suits. He added: What I was later told was that I was taken to hospital in Bath but they didnapost have facilities for a dialysis patient so I was moved to Southmead in Bristol. I went to ICU and was given dialysis continuously while I was asleep. I was so ill with Covid, the x-rays showed it was all over my chest and I was struggling to breathe so they put me on a ventilator and induced me. I donapost remember anything from the start until waking up. Paul said he also apossubconsciouslyapos heard his favourite music which his brother had asked medical staff to play for him. He also recalls the moment he finally came around. He added: My mum died a year ago and she used to train horses along the seafront in Weymouth when she was younger. She was riding bareback and just looked at me and smiled. That is when I woke up. It was like she wouldnapost let me die. I have had to come to terms with what is in my own head. Delirium is a recognised result of being in an induced coma. When you talk to people who have been in that position they say it can make you go mad - as it seems so real.  Paul has needed help with a physio and phycologist since he came out. He has also had to teach himself to eat and walk again. And when he came round he said the delirium continued. He added: The first thing I said to my we was have Tesla phoned  A week later I was still having nightmares. It appeared to me the nurses were operating on a double-decker bus by remote control. In their office was a desk with a steering wheel. Paul, who had to give up work after being diagnosed with cancer, is now recovering at home after being discharged on August  and is looking positively to the future. He added: From a physical side I was diagnosed with cancer three years ago that killed my kidneys. The cancer is still there and I still have dialysis but I am feeling stronger from being in a coma. It was almost like I was rebooted and needed the rest. I am just trying to live a normal le. I have dialysis three times a week into the arm but I am a positive person and try to see the best of my situation.But the doubters need to know that catching Covid is a serious thing. There are so many people without masks now there is no wonder we are in the trouble we are in. My sons really supported my we Dalma as it was a tough time for all of them. They all thought they were going to bury me and it was time for me to go. It shows what Covid can do to a family. It can destroy it. Dalma added: I have been ready to say goodbye to my husband for about three years now.When he caught coronavirus this summer, I thought he wasn’t coming home because they sayyou have underlying conditions it hits you harder.The doctors said he was a miracle.

Warning - graphic video below  What do you think about the embarrassing moment  Let us know in the comments...In the clip, an assistant holding the dogaposs leash is seen retching in the background while the dog owner cheers: Woo, here it goes. The camera woman can be heard saying: Just walking away, yeah weaposre good. The Reddit user shared the clip along with a joke: When you want to party but you get too excited.

Wouldn’t say why. Many dog owners were left in hysterics and said their dogs also sometimes swallow very unusual things. My a**hole dog decided to eat a random used tampon we walked by.

She goes on to say that the American version would be The Hunger Games, the Japanese would be Alice in Borderland, and one TikTok user quipped that the UK version would be The Great British Bake Off.  What do you think about the theory  Let us know in the comments...Taking to TikTok, the woman said: So in the section the VIPs come and they say theyaposre dying to know what the next game is, the other guy says apostheyaposve been amazing this edition, right apos and aposthe contest in Korea is the bestapos. Wait a second though, that implies that Squid Game is everywhere internationally. That means thereaposs a high chance that squid game in Japan is Alice in Borderland, and in the US is maybe Hunger Games. I canapost even begin to imagine what Squid Game in other countries would be like. Ruthaposs video soon went viral with over three million views, , likes and countless comments, mostly from people speculating what their countries version of the game would be.

Instagram star Natalie Bolyn, @thee_hair_gal, uploaded a video to social media explaining how customers coming in with dirty hair is one of her pet peeves.She said that some customers believe that having unwashed hair can help with the styling process, but Natalie insists that this is a myth. Natalie created the short clip, where she recreates a conversation with a customer, to spread the truth about the old-wives tale and encourage people to wash their hair before getting it cut.  What do you think about Natalieaposs advice  Let us know in the commentsNatalie wrote: I don’t know who along the way told people dirty hair is better for up-dos, but it is simply not true! Yes, a wash the night before you get your hair styled is usually the perfect canvas for upstyling, but this isn’t true for everyone - because like I’ve said before no one personaposs hair is the same! You know your hair! If you are prone to getting super greasy hair after not washing for a day then by all means wash the day of. I can make your hair dirty, I can’t make it clean. Don’t show up with five-day-old greasy smelly hair, that s*** will be amplied when I start using heat and no one wants to smell some greasy five-day-old hair. When we say aposdirty hairapos we mean washed the day night before. You don’t get extra credit for extra crusty hair. Natalie went on to share other top tips, saying that dry hair is fine. She continued: Do come with dry hair! If you wash your hair the day of please make sure you come with dry hair, wedding days are go go go, so to help prep your hair make sure it is dry for your stylist, we more than likely don’t have time to do a full blow out and style. Don’t straighten your hairOnce your hair is flat iron it isn’t going to hold a curl unless wet down and dried again.

But then the woman left him, aposprobably for a man with a much more impressive motorhome than mineapos, so he decided to sell it - saying itaposs perfect for aposanother coerced partner, or sadistapos. What do you think about the campervan  Let us know in the comments...In the advert, the man writes: Well, well, well. Where do I start with this  Up for sale is my  Bedford CF campervan. A perfect restoration candidate for another coerced partner, or sadist. I never wanted a campervan, my now ex girlfriend did. So we comprised and purchased a camper, without ever laying eyes on it first might I add. It was intended to be a aposjointapos project which in reality turned into her standing around for half a day complaining about the shed weaposd bought, and the remainder of the time on my back about how long it was taking to transform it into her aposperfect tranquil cabin on wheelsapos. Yikes. Fast forward a few months and she decided to up and leaveleaving only behind this sad slab of misery on wheels. Apart from being an eyesore and driving down local property prices, it serves as a personal reminder that the last few years of my le have truly and utterly been a waste. As you can probably tell by this point Iaposm eager to get this thing off of my drive and draw a line under this turbulent chapter. So without further ado hereaposs a little more about the van. He then goes on to describe the good points of the van, saying that itaposs largely rust free underneath, good progress has been made on the conversion, and it doesnapost leak anymore.  It also comes with everything needed to convert it into a campervan, including a full wiring kit, water tanks, cladding, and a heater. However, the advert then goes on to describe more of the motorhomeaposs bad points - including the fact that it doesnapost run any more. Itaposs also got corrosion to the bodywork, will need repainting, and worst of all - it taunts me daily of my past failures and lost loveFor more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. The advert continues: If youaposve made it this far you are probably mentally unwell or still being forced into making a perfect love den for those romantic weekend getaways, either way, I applaud the dedication. If you do decide to bid on it and God forbid you actually win, you will have to get it transported or collect it yourself as I have neither the time, the means or the will to deliver it for you. I will do my best to answer any serious queries, butyou ask me about the flow rate of the shower for example I probably wonapost. Itaposs not perfectnor road ready so donapost expect it to be and you wonapost be disappointed, itaposs a cheap project and a good way to break into the world of motorhome owning. Iaposm just trying to get a little money back so I can go on a heavy night of drinking, perhaps visit a lady of the night depending on how well the auction goes and then close this awful chapter of my le.

Solomon Islanders Licvae Nanjikana and Junior Qoloni set out from Mono Island on September  on what should have been a -mile voyage to new South Georgia. The experienced seamen had taken the trip before and planned to use visual markers to help guide their route. But the pair ran into disaster when torrential rain and heavy winds battered their small motorboat. During the storms, their GPS packed in and the men found themselves cast adrt in a notoriously rough and unpredictable stretch of water. “We have done the trip before and it should have been OK,” Nanjikana told the . Without global positioning, they had no way of telling which direction to turn. They decided to stop the engine in the hopes of saving fuel, Nanjikana said. The men had taken a store of oranges with them, which helped to keep them alive. Another source of food came in the form of coconuts bobbing along the waves. The men fought off dehydration by using a piece of canvas to catch falling rain. The duo floated  miles before being spotted by a fisherman off the coast of New Britain, Papua New Guinea. “We didn’t know where we were but did not expect to be in another country,” Nanjikana said.  The men were so weak when they were rescued on October  that locals had to carry them off the boat. They are currently living with a local resident in Pomio on the south of New Britain island. Nanjikana said the ordeal was a nice break from Covid, thereports. “I had no idea what was going on while I was out there. I didn’t hear about Covid or anything ,” he said. “I look forward to going back home but I guess it was a nice break from everything.” Earlier this year, a trio shipwrecked on a deserted island in the Bahamas were rescued after somehow surviving for  days.  The two men and a woman told their stunned rescuers they had managed to survive the epic ordeal by eating coconuts. The castaways claimed they swam to the uninhabited island after their boat capsized in rough waters. Dramatic footage captured the moment a chopper crew who spotted the marooned trio on a rocky outcrop dropped them le-saving supplies. The crew said the three people had desperately waved flags as the craft flew over Anguilla Cay, an uninhabited Bahama Banks island, during a routine air patrol on Monday. A US Coastguard helicopter crew filmed themselves parachuting the supplies from the aircraft. It captures the moment the three castaways stranded below realised salvation had finally arrived. The chopper crewaposs footage also captured a makesht encampment the group had built on the island. The man and two women, who were said to all be Cuban nationals, reportedly told their rescuers they had been stranded for about five weeks on the archipelago, which is located between Cuba and the Florida Keys. None of the castaways appeared seriously hurt, the United States Coast Guardtold reporters.

There is the sports department, which is  a joy to those in tennis, swimming or allied pursuits.#And there are the toys which intrigue adults as much as children.#Traditional favourites find ready buyers, but at the same time the best ideas in new games and toys are to be found in The Rubber Shop, which keeps very much in tune with the times.#The shop promised to cater for all budgets and occasions stocking everything from exquisite crystal souvenirs and child-sized teddy bears, to ministers# dog collars and deckchairs.At Christmas , the must-have gt from The Rubber Shop was a leather-covered wine decanter #at a modest price#.And #for the man keen on gadgets, a battery-powered pencil sharpener and matching aluminium paperclip holder#.But those preferring a cosy Christmas gt could also pick up cable-knit sweaters and moccasin slippers.Meanwhile, it was said the sports enthusiast #really came into his own# in the sports department, pictured above in .Here Aberdonians could purchase jodhpurs, rubber riding boots, sports kits and tennis racquets.The shop enjoyed a close relationship with sporting groups in Aberdeen the founder#s son Ian Fowler had been honorary president of the Aberdeen Lawn Tennis Association and honorary vice-president of the city#s table tennis league.But despite its success and place in the hearts of Aberdonians, The Rubber Shop closed in  # just four years short of its centenary.Uncertainty over the redevelopment of George Street forced the Fowler family to make the dficult decision to shut up the shop for the final time on May  .Mrs Fowler said the trading conditions have become #impossible# due to the opening of the St Nicholas Centre nearby and the proposed Bon Accord Centre development.It was unknown what would happen to the buildings on George Street and Mrs Fowler added: #There was no way we could take on other premises without knowing the outcome of negotiations for the sale of our George Street shop.#It was an emotional day as Mrs Fowler bid goodbye to her  full-time and nine part-time staff, many of whom had served the family business for decades.She said: #They are all so sad. The girls have been crying, every now and then.#And the closure of The Rubber Shop was a regretful day too for long-standing customers who had come to know and trust a business built on family tradition.See more like this:For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/09/MicrosoftTeams-image-22-300x180.jpg class=attachment-part-medium size-part-medium wp-post-image ","title":"coronavirus in scotland here are the key demographics","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remWe’ve put together some regularly updating charts and maps showing the demographic information available on the people affected by the coronavirus pandemic in Scotland.The charts below show the distribution of deaths by age and gender.Given the way the virus transmits, we also looked at whether there was any link between the fatality rate and the population density.The NRS provides information on the number of deaths by smaller areas, known as intermediate zones, once per month.The chart below shows the proportion of deaths by location.This chart shows Covid- as a proportion of deaths each week in Scotland.The animated chart below shows where Covid- sits in the ranks of leading causes of death in Scotland.Covid vaccine in Scotland: Track the rollout progress with these charts\" title\"#Covid vaccine in Scotland: Track the rollout progress with these charts# #

defeat of rivals Austria in Vienna last month.Now as Scotland host Israel at a sold out Hampden, Clarke has called for a victory that will make the his side odds on favourites to finish second and secure a play-off berth.Scotland currently occupy second spot in Group F and hold a one point advantage over third placed Israel.Clarke said:  #Somebody said we still only have a % chance of qualying for the World Cup.#That shows you how dficult it is for a country like ourselves to come out of this section.#But we were looking at a % chance before the Austria game of claiming second position and now we are up to %.#We need to make sure now that we build on the two results we got last month, put us into a position to control second place.#We need to cement that against Israel.#Scotland#s victory over second seeded Austria in Vienna ensured Clarke#s side now control their own destiny.Should they defeat Israel the Scots will face group minnows Faroe Islands away on Tuesday and  Moldova away next month.Maximum points from the Israel, Faroe Islands and Moldova triple header would effectively secure second spot before the Scots close the campaign with a final Group F game against leaders Denmark at Hampden on November .Clarke said: #You always want to control your own destiny.#It’s up to us to continue that as we have put ourselves in a really good position.#I used to say it with my club sides,you went to a place where you weren’t expected to get a big result, get it and then don’t follow it up with the next game then it’s a result that goes to waste.#We don’t want to waste the energy and the quality from the - victory in the last game. We have to make sure we get another positive result this time.#Clarke is quick to dismiss any notion that Scotland#s win in Vienna has reduced the battle for runners-up spot into a two horse race between Scotland and Israel.Austria, he insists, cannot be discounted even though they are four points behind the Scots and lost - to Israel in Haa last month.He said: #I think it would be foolish to rule Austria out.#They showed in the summer they are a good team.#Austria  had a little dip, the last window wasn’t great for them but they are a proud nation and they’ll want to be better this time and next month.#They’ll be looking at the last four games and thinking about picking  points.#That’s how I imagine it. Obviously ourselves and Israel with the results against Austria have put us in a better position but the Austrians won’t give up just yet.’A packed Hampden will cheer on the Scots for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic struck in March last year.Clarke insists the capacity crowd is not only down to the easing of lockdown restrictions at games but also the willingness of the supporters to come to the qualier.He reckons the Tartan Army can deliver an edge against a side the Scots will be playing competitively for the seventh time in three years.Clarke said: #It’s strange to have to wait so long but obviously it has been strange times over the last two years for everybody.#It’s nice that we are finally in a position where we can sell out Hampden and also that we have managed to put ourselves in a position where the supporters are buying into it.#The supporters enjoyed being part of the European Championships in the summer and, okay, it didn’t quite go the way we wanted it to.#But I think the supporters enjoyed the fact they were involved in the tournament.#It was their tournament, they were there, they were in it.#Selling out this game tells you that the supporters want to get behind this group of players, which is fantastic for them.#And also a credit to them as well.’Clarke has no doubt a pm kick-off on a Saturday will lead to a Hampden Roar from the Tartan Army.He insists it is the job of himself and his players to ensure the home support have something to cheer for the entire ninety minutes.The national boss said: #The supporters before the game are going to be fantastic, we know that.#We know they will be fantastic at the start of the game.#If we can start the game well and get on top, then they can carry us a long way.#There will also be times in the game when we will be under pressure and have to control the game without the ball.#The supporters need to show they can be patient and get behind us when we need that bit of support.

When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

Yet we often treat them in a dismissive way.Let#s think about some insects.Take the bluebottle. How often has it outwitted us with its amazing flight paths, ducking and ing to avoid our threatening gestures.While we have developed some of the most sophisticated flying machines the world has known, none can match the bluebottle in its agility.We have mentioned pollination. What insect is more important than the bee as it goes about its business from flower to flower ensuring that the plants will produce seed for another year and giving us honey as a product of its labours.How beautul too are its colours and the structure of its body – a remarkable little insect.Then there is the humble moth and its gravity-defying antics walking across ceilings. It has a very fragile body but in its short le can nevertheless act out its own acrobatic skill in an amazing performance.Or we may think of the spider and the beauty of its web, perhaps seen on a frosty winter morning. A true work of art woven with such delicacy.In the bible we read this: #Go watch the ants, you lazy person. Watch what they do and be wise.

explorers , years ago.And the secrets of Dunyvaig Castle continue to be revealed, including medieval gaming boards and the remains of a young hunting hound.University of Reading#s Professor of Early Prehistory Steven Mithen says long flints used by pioneer travellers from the north of Germany and Scandinavia have been uncovered at Rubha Port-ant-Seilich at what could be the first preserved Ice Age campsite in Scotland.Finding the blades, which would have been attached to an antler or bone shaft and used to clean animal skins, gives a good indication that the excavating team has found a campsite which dates to right at the end of the Ice Age.It was a time when Scotland would still have been joined to the continent by Doggerland and experts think the explorer travellers would have come on skin boats.Sediment taken from the Ice Age layer will now be tested for ancient DNA of plants and animals to build a more detailed picture of the everyday lives of those visitors.The Ice Age finds were found below a preserved hunter gatherer camp from the middle of the Stone Age, where evidence of a fireplace in a dwelling, was earlier discovered.It was only when pigs were brought in to eat bracken on the coastline that the flints started to turn up, which Professor Mithen dated to the Mesolithic period.He said Dunyvaig Castle, a scheduled monument, also continues to reveal its secrets  below the tussocky grass, peat and rubble that bury its ancient past.Islay Heritage and the University of Reading continued exploring Dunyvaig over three weeks in late August and September with permission from owners Lagavulin Distillery and from Historic Environment Scotland.The dig was used as a training school for archaeology students.The team of  travelled to the island and worked there under strict Covid rules which meant there could be no public engagement, #tragically#, said Professor Mithen.#That will be made up for in  with public talks and exhibitions about the new finds from Dunyvaig these telling us more about its fascinating past and Islay#s history,# he added.Dunyvaig Castle, on the south coast of Islay, was the naval fortress of the Lords of the Isles and Clan Donald between the th and th centuries, and fought over by the MacDonalds and Campbells during the early th century.#Having explored several walls, buildings, and the sea-gate in  and , the task in  was to investigate the external fortications,# said Prof Mithen.#A key target was the trace of a bastion, faintly emerging from the pebble beach of Lagavulin Bay, and whatever lay beyond the bastion outside of the courtyard wall.#Although we are still assessing the results, the bastion was shown to have been constructed relatively early in the sequence of building at Dunyvaig – perhaps th century – and was quite massive in form.#It had a triangular shape that is unique for Western Scotland, indicating the status and strategic signicance of Dunyvaig.#To the east of the bastion, the walls of an equally massive building were found, the existence of this building having been quite unknown.#The walls had been carefully built using large boulders mortared together and plastered on the inside face.#Its original purpose remains unclear, as does its date, but we are tempted by the idea of a grand hall, one where visitors would have been wined and dined, alliances formed and battleplans devised.#After it went out of use, the building was used as a rubbish dump – providing ideal finds for archaeologists.#Large quantities of butchered animal bones were dumped, primarily from cattle and sheep that will tell us about the diet and the economy of the castle, while pieces of pottery came from plates and vessels which will be invaluable for dating once classied.#The carcass of a dog was discarded, possibly buried, into the midden. Although yet to be identied, it seems to be the skeleton of a juvenile, perhaps a hunting hound of the type sometimes depicted on medieval grave slabs.#An unexpected find within the midden was a collection of medieval gaming boards – pieces of slate incised with lines on which games known as Fox and Geese and Alquerque had been played.#An especially exciting and useful find was a coin dating to James VI that would have been struck in the late th or early th century.

The card had superior artistic merit and I wanted to make use of it in the book, which was to include a number of old cards by the celebrated North Berwick postcard artist Reginald Phillimore.The problem, however, was that no information was forthcoming where this obscure cottage had been or how it had earnt sufficient fame to be depicted by Phillimore.The book was published in  without lsquoCleikum Tollrsquo being featured.The purchase of another Edwardian postcard belatedly solved the mystery in August : it turned out that the careless Phillimore had got the name wrong, since it was not lsquoCleikum Tollrsquo but lsquoCleikimin Tollrsquo!And indeed, inquiries demonstrated that this turnpike and tollhouse had been standing at the cross between the road from Dunbar to Spott and the road from Broxburn to Belton. It is likely there were two turnpikes, one on each road. The tollhouse was said to be very old, quite possibly constructed in the first half of the th century.In early Victorian times, the tollgate system kept flourishing all over Britain. In rural west Wales, there were full-scale riots in  after a number of novel turnpikes had been erected, something the locals disapproved of. Men dressed as women attacked the turnpikes and beat up the tollkeepers, and it was only with dficulty they could be pacied.Cleikimin Toll was spared such indignities, however: it was still operational at the time of the Ordnance Survey of -. The name-book of this survey [OS    ] refers to it as a ldquoA Toll Bar at a junction of roads situated about half a mile south of the town of Dunbar.A note explains Cleikimin as a name usually applied to a cheap public house, where a Cleik [Scottish for fish-hook] was supposed to have been made use of to pull the customers inside.The arrival of the railways did much damage to the old tollgate system all over Britain: as a result, the road toll revenue plummeted and the tollkeepers grumbled incessantly.The Scottish municipal authorities realised the old-fashioned turnpikes were on the way out, and by  they were all gone.The tollhouse at Cleikimin Toll stood well into Edwardian times, being admired as a quaint relic of olden days.

Proposals also include “active travel” routes, e-bike chargers and welcome facilities, alongside coach permits and charging at some car parks.The programme is being funded with joint investment of up to £. million from the Scottish Government and UK Government, as part of the Islands Growth Deal — a ten-year investment programme jointly funded by the UK and Scottish governments, the three island councils and their partners from the public, academic and business sectors.During the in-person sessions, due to take place next Tuesday and Wednesday, attendees will be guided through proposals with representatives from project partners.OIC leader, Councillor James Stockan, said: “The Islands Deal commitment we have from the Scottish and UK Governments to support the Orkney Gateway is hugely gratying and reflects the position our World Heritage Site holds as one of the jewels in Scotland’s and indeed the UK’s tourism crown — not to mention the global archaeological signicance of the site.“But we must remember that at the core of this is a landscape and series of monuments which for many Orcadians is a direct, mysterious and powerful link to their past. And we know equally they are held very dear by people who’ve moved into these islands over the years.“So, as partners, we are all very clear that we want to gather local people’s views on the range of options that we could bid for through our final Islands Deal business case.”The consultation events are scheduled for Tuesday, October , at Maeshowe Visitor Centre, Stenness, from pm to pm, and Wednesday, October , at St Magnus Centre, Kirkwall, from pm until pm.If you’re unable to attend these events, further information is available at www.orkney.gov.uk orkneygateway.

So any acts that undermine that trust must be examined and fundamentally changed.ldquoThis will no doubt be a dficult task but we owe it to the victims and families this has affected and the countless decent police officers this has brought into disrepute.London Mayor Sadiq Khan welcomed her appointment as public trust in the cityrsquos police has been ldquoseverely damaged and requires urgent rebuilding.He said in a statement on Twitter: ldquoIrsquove been clear with the Met Commissioner about the scale of the challenge we face and the change thatrsquos needed, and I will continue to play my full part in holding the Met Police to account on behalf of Londoners.The spotlight will also be shone on the forcersquos Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command ndash which killer Wayne Couzens worked for ndash with a ldquoroot-and-branch review looking at whether there are any ldquospecic issues within the unit.Armed officer Couzens used his police issue handcuffs and warrant card to stage a fake arrest so he could kidnap -year-old Ms Everard before he raped and murdered her. vw,vw,px, px\"Baroness Casey will lead the review It later emerged the -year-old was known as ldquothe rapist by staff at the Civil Nuclear Constabulary because he made female colleagues feel so uncomfortable.He had been accused of indecent exposure in Kent in  and in London in the days before Ms Everardrsquos murder, but was allowed to continue working.Officers from the professional standards department will review each current case of sexual or domestic abuse allegations against those on the force, looking at vetting and conduct history, to make sure the investigations are ldquoabsolutely thorough and that victims are being ldquoproperly supported.The ldquosignicant piece of work will also look at a sample of cases from the last decade of sexual misconduct and domestic abuse allegations where those accused remain on the force to ldquocheck appropriate management measureshave been taken, the Met said.The number of investigators will be boosted and an action plan will be published within weeks to set out the steps the force is taking to improve ldquohow we tackle the issues women and girls tell us make them feel unsafe. vw,vw,px, px\"Sarah Everard The Met review is separate to the independent inquiry announced by the Home Secretary Priti Patel on Tuesday to look into the ldquosystematic failures that allowed Ms Everardrsquos killer to be employed as a police officer.Other probes are also being carried out by Her Majestyrsquos Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire  Rescue Servicesand the Independent Office of Police Conduct .According to The Times, Ms Patel has set Dame Cressida three key targets to meet in order to keep her job: Statistics must show that serious violence and kne crime in London is falling the Met must show evidence they are improving their response to violence against women and girls and the force must co-operate with an independent inquiry into its failures that led to Couzens murdering Everard.Meanwhile, police data for England and Wales forces has shown The Met has the lowest success rate for solving sexual and violent crime, with just one in  offences resulting in a charge, according to the Daily .IOPC director general Michael Lockwood said in two years the watchdog has seen  referrals where abuse of power for sexual gain by police officers was a factor.Of these,  were serious enough to warrant an investigation by the police watchdog.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

But pupils had to also develop their presentation skills to explain their design plans to their peers.The Spaceflight Programme, run by the UK Space Agency, has invested over £M to develop three spaceports in Cornwall, Shetland and Sutherland. The UK will soon have the ability to launch small satellites from horizontal and vertical launchers operating from spaceports located around the UK, including the SaxaVord UK Spaceport in Unst.The work done by Shetland pupils will be submitted for judging, with the winning designs announced in the coming weeks.Head Teacher at Whalsay School Garry Spence said: “Our pupils have worked really well together in their groups and they’ve been fully engaged with this competition.

But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CATTLE-SALES-SEP-21-2-scaled.jpg","title":"remember your roots skye plan is urged to recognise","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThose were the comments of Roddy Murray, former Western Isles councillor and now the grazings clerk for Tarskavaig in Sleat, who this week voiced his concern that there was no mention of crofting at all in the ‘Skye and Raasay Future’ plan published in August with the full backing of all four local councillors.He told the Free Press: “There are  projects listed in the plan but not a single mention of crofting. Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4142135.jpg--.jpg?1633698699000\n","title":"portglenone firm launch innovative new coffin pod","story":"A Portglenone hearse building firm has credited the support received from Mid and East Antrim Borough Council in helping secure funding to launch an innovative ‘Coffin Pod’ which will help protect grieving families and funeral directors as the COVID- pandemic continues.Family-owned Quinn Hearse  Limousines have specialised in the design and manufacture of hearses and limousines for over a quarter of a century, and currently employ  staff.The company’s revolutionary new product has been launched following extensive market research after Quinn’s were awarded the Innovate NI Gold Standard accreditation.The Coffin Pod is a sealed glass pod which will allow funeral directors to transport coffins safely, and allow families to have open coffin wakes while observing social distancing measures.The development of the new product has been made possible with the support of a network of stakeholders, including the council’s Economic Development team, Innovate UK and Invest NI.Patrick Quinn, Company Director, said: “Innovation and new product development have been core to the business’s continued success. We had the idea to develop the Coffin Pod, after seeing the impact that Covid- was having on families being unable to properly mourn for their loved ones and to protect funeral directors in transport to their final resting place. Mid and East Antrim Borough Council have supported us through the process of applying for the Innovate UK Challenge Fund to address the current and future impacts of Covid-. With their support, we successfully secured the funding to develop our Coffin Pod.“We are delighted to have now launched this into the market, and to have been awarded the Innovate NI Gold standard for this product. We continue to develop our core product ranges of hearses and limousines and have several new vehicles under development.”Speaking about the ongoing support received by the council, Patrick added:“Through our interaction with Council’s Business Client Manager, Barbara Orr we have received support through the Business Escalator and Business Escalator Plus Programmes to develop our export markets and growth development. The support through the programmes and assistance from Barbara has been truly worthwhile and I would recommend that businesses in our borough take advantage of the help available.“As we continue to move forward, we aim to make use of the assistance in the many dferent areas of running our business, to grow and create more jobs for the people of Ballymena.”Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, said: “Quinn Hearse  Limousine is just one of many companies across Mid and East Antrim to have benefitted from support via Council’s Amply programmes, since the launch of our economic development strategy in .“As well as supporting our SMEs to navigate through the current challenges posed by COVID-, we are preparing for the new economic landscape as we navigate post lockdown, and have provided expert guidance to support Quinn Hearse  Limousine with its longer-term business development strategy.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council’s Business Escalator and Escalator Plus Programmes are part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.To find out more make an enquiry today via midandeastantrim.gov.uk EscalatorPlus "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1633709144535.jpg--covid_19___fri_8th_october_figures.jpg?1633709144000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211008newscovid 19 fri 8th october figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows two further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

Picture: PAAmy CochraneTwitterEmailOctober   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Taoiseach has expressed ‘surprise’ at Sinn Fein’s opposition to sending Irish government representatives to a service to mark Northern Irelands centenary.Micheal Martin was speaking on a visit to Belfast on Friday.Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O#Neill criticised the decision to send representatives to the event in Armagh, which Irish president Michael D Higgins declined an invitation to.Mr Martin hit back, saying he was surprised by Sinn Fein#s stance, adding they sent a senior representative to a similar event organised by the Presbyterian Church.It was revealed that the Irish Government will be sending Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney and Government Chief Whip Jack Chambers to attend the interdenominational service on October .Mr Martin said: “The President’s decision was properly taken and consistent with views he articulated earlier, so we fully support the President.“In terms of the government being subsequently invited to the event, we have to take on board the spirit in which that invitation was sent to us, so we decided to be represented at it.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up In response to Sinn Fein’s opposition to send two government representatives to the event, Mr Martin said that he was “surprised”.“Sinn Fein would have attended events last September at the Presbyterian Church, at an event more or less the same type to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland and partition, so I don’t get the consistency of the Sinn Fein viewpoint on this quite frankly.“I would ask at this stage we need to move on in terms of walking collectively together on this island in the spirit of reconciliation.”Mr Martin was speaking after a busy day of engagements.His first stop off was a meeting at the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Chambers Ireland to discuss the current climate agenda, as well as the upcoming COP and the importance of protecting bioersity in both Northern Ireland and the Republic with cross-border projects.He said that it is “no exaggeration to say that the topic and the timing could not be more important.”“The impact of climate change will be felt by every inidual, household, business and community on this island. It is no longer something that can be assigned to some distant future,” said Mr Martin.“The next ten years are vitalwe are to address the climate crisis and ensure a safe and bright future for us all.“This is why the COP Summit in Glasgow next month will be so important and why Ireland will be participating fully. Translating the science and the urgency of the climate and bioersity crisis into policy and action is key and this will provide a critical forum.”He then visited a women’s centre in North Belfast, the first visit of its kind for Mr Martin in his role as Taoiseach.There, he spoke with women and girls who benefit from courses and training provided by Women’s Tec, the largest provider of training for women in non-traditional skills in Northern Ireland.During his time at the centre he tried his hand at learning how to drill a bird box with one of the Year  pupils from Trinity College Belfast who took park in Women’s Tec’s ‘Not Just for Boys’ summer scheme program.This programme taught young girls a iety of heritage skills such as joinery and plastering to encourage more women to enter the trade professions.Mr Martin then got some ‘hands-on’ practice with the women from the ‘Time for Me’ group at Women’s Tec who showed him how to plaster cast his hand.Lynn Carvill, CEO of Women’s Tec, said: “Over the past  months, we have seen the needs of women in our communities rise signicantly and we have been working hard to address these needs and help women to succeed in all areas of their lives.“An Taoiseach’s visit today will help us shine a spotlight on the important work we do at Women’s Tec.“We’re delighted to welcome him to our building and are grateful for the opportunity to showcase what we do here.”He finished off his visit there by witnessing first-hand the benefits of the on-site creche for all the local women and admiring their very own Suffragette-themed garden.Mr Martin said that he then had a “very interesting” visit to the cancer research centre at Queen’s University Belfast on Thursday afternoon where he witnessed some of the “first-class projects” they are undertaking there.“We then had a broader discussion with the Queen’s University’s authorities in respect of the shared island initiative on research,” he said.“Through this there is great possibilities in terms of developing all-island research for projects so we can help solve problems and contribute to the solutions of problems which the island faces, be it climate change, be it cancer, be it other areas of health, be it infectious diseases, be it cyber security.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadFamily’s grief after Belfast dad of four is electrocuted in work accident… we recalls last time they spokeHow ‘Costa del North Coast’ no longer haven for working class as house rental hits £k for a week‘Kind, unassuming and effective’: Boris Johnson and Micheal Martin lead tributes to former NI SecretaryNI voucher scheme: how to get more bang for your buckCo Armagh mother and son died almost instantaneously when car struck at mph, inquest toldTop VideosPlayVideo: INLA gun salute investigated  Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"PlayVideo: New Belfast restaurant opens but there#s no menuPlayVideo: Man sets himself on fire at City Hall, Belfast WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENTLatest Northern IrelandPSNI officers quizzed over online sexual allegations still receiving full payAntrim care home struggling with Covid outbreak amid workforce crisisClose to , NI Civil Service agency staff still waiting for pay rise announced last yearTaoiseach hails potential of all-island co-operation during Belfast visitDennis Hutchings trial: Military police who attended scene of shooting say they remember little or nothing of that dayLatestCillian Murphy to reunite with Christopher Nolan for director’s next filmAaron Ramsey refuses to blame Danny Ward after his howler costs Wales in PragueUlster -

The UUP’s new party political broadcast is like nothing I’ve ever seen before from a unionist party.A child holding a hurling stick and a sliotar. A same sex couple.

A goth. Read MoreUUP’s Doug Beattie: Why I wouldn’t have posed with HutchingsUlster Unionists must improve its gender imbalance, says leader Doug BeattieThere are no sober-suited politicians with stern faces giving off about the latest betrayal and warning that the Union is in grave danger. This is a positive, hopeful video that takes us across Northern Ireland from dawn to dusk. Mothers, fathers, farmers waking up and beginning their day. A young man going out on his morning run.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Children with Down’s Syndrome eating breakfast with their family. We see a teacher, a baker, a florist, a taxi-driver, a greengrocer, a shelf-stacker, a working mum — baby in her arms — as the day progresses.It all moves along to an upbeat song specially commissioned for the party. This is “Eurovision meets unionism”, as the commentator David McCann quipped. It’s utterly inclusive and the positive vibe is infectious.Even the opposition was impressed. Alliance’s Belfast Lord Mayor, Kate Nicholl, watched it with her two-year-old son. “He started crying when it stopped so we had to watch it again,” she tweeted.Doug Beattie has put clear red, white and blue water between himself and the DUP and TUV.The video is meant to reflect his ‘Union of the people’. Not unionists as they’re often represented in the media or by some politicians — always angry, negative, and fearful — but as ordinary folk living their lives the same as everyone . There is no single stereotype that fits.The mood in the broadcast is a million miles from that of angry protesters on the streets lambasting the protocol or those wanting to turn the clock back to another century.It’s grounded in Northern Ireland , and it’s forward looking. Never has a political leader in Northern Ireland altered the image of his party so rapidly.Beattie is just four months in the job, and the pace of change is phenomenal.There have been new, high-profile recruits an Assembly candidate from a working-class nationalist background and a drive to bring in more women, although the party has a long way to go on the journey to gender equality.Beattie will address his first annual conference in Belfast tomorrow. The most welcome guest will be hope.In just four months, the new leader appears on course to do what has eluded his predecessors over almost two decades — reverse the UUP’s decline.It has long been on the back foot. Despite Red Sky, RHI and the alphabet soup of scandals that have hit its rival, it has never been able to land a blow on the DUP.For the first time in a long time, there is excitement and confidence in the party’s ranks.The UUP is up from % to % in LucidTalk opinion polls since he took up the reins. That helps the new leader hugely. Success breeds success winning becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.But there are dangers too. Some observers believe the ‘Beattie bounce’ is over-hyped. It’s one thing changing the party’s image and making gains in the polls. Transforming its fortunes by securing votes in an actual election is a trickier matter.The weight of expectation now lies on Beattie’s shoulders. He certainly can’t be accused of playing it safe. Every unionist leader at one point or another talks of the need to change, few have followed through.There are risks involved. How will the latest party broadcast go down with traditional UUP members in rural areas Beattie’s views don’t always chime with conservative grassroots members, although his personal popularity, military background and those positive poll results help him with that section of the party.But a good Assembly election result next May is crucial for his leadership. The UUP must win more seats in Stormont.

No decisions have been made.”It comes as rising energy costs have prompted industry leaders to warn the Government their factories could stop production or permanently close.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-beb-c-afd-aeaff_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-beb-c-afd-aeaff_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-beb-c-afd-aeaff_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-beb-c-afd-aeaff_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Minister of State at the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Kwasi Kwarteng PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueMinister of State at the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Kwasi Kwarteng Andrew Large, director-general at the Confederation of Paper Industries, and Gareth Stace from UK Steel attended a meeting with the Business Secretary and other representatives of energy intensive industries to discuss the wholesale gas crisis on Friday afternoon.Speaking to the BBC Radio ’s PM programme afterwards, Mr Large claimed it was “very clear” across all of the sectors that there are “serious” risks factories could stop all activities as a result of the gas prices being too high.He said: “When we talked with the Secretary of State this afternoon, it was very, very clear across all of the sectors that there are serious risks of effectively factory stoppages as a result of the costs of gas being too high to bear, and in those circumstances there will be a gradual knock-on effect through supply chains, right the way across manufacturing, consumer retail and other products. And so the risks are very, very real.”Speaking to Channel  News, Mr Stace insisted the worst-case scenario would see steel plants closing for good.He explained: “The nightmare scenario would be that we produce less steel in the UK, that we see all of that steel that we do consume in the UK, and that’s increasing, be met by imports and once you take away a steel plant, you don’t really bring them back.“That’s it for good. Once it’s done, it’s done.”Analysts have predicted UK customers could see their energy bills rise by % next year.Research agency Cornwall Insight has claimed further volatile gas prices and the potential collapse of even more suppliers could push the energy price cap to around £, in summer.The forecast is approximately % higher than the record £, price cap set for winter -, which commenced at the start of October.

It’s what you now do with that money that’s important because it can be easy to do nothing, and within a few months, the raise gets consumed by increased spending, and this is typically known as lestyle creep i.e. as your income increases, so do your outgoings, by the same amount.     Which is a shame because when you get a raise,put to good use, it should really put you ahead financially and allow you to achieve things, you were unable to on a lower salary.If you don’t take advantage and you’re not intentional with what you’re going to do with it, you end up in exactly the same position as before, and you’re just working harder without living better and that’s not what you want.So, how do you avoid this from happening to you Ideally, you want to give some thought into how you can benefit from your new higher earnings, and I will re-visit this in more detail, in a second follow article next week, because there’s a lot to cover.         However, I do know there are those who are just looking for a number, and don’t want to carry out that deep e into what impact a specic number would have on particular areas of their finances.So, with them and everyone  in mind, I’m going to share with you three very good rules of thumb that I like and think are useful.They were first developed by the financial services giant, Morningstar, and this is what they are suggesting you should do with a raise:. Spend twice your years to retirementIf you have  years to retirement, you can spend % of your raise and save the rest.. Save your age, as a % of the raiseIf you are  years’ old, save % of your raise.. Save at least % of your raiseRegardless of your age or years to your target date for retirement is, just save % of your raise.When Morningstar ran dferent scenarios, they discovered the spend twice your years to retirement created the biggest impact across all age groups because it usually involves saving the most money.The rules I’ve referred to focus on how much of the raise can be spent rather than how much can be saved, and that’s very deliberate i.e. you don’t want people to feel they have to save every extra cent they now earn and can’t enjoy some of the raise they received.Or do they have to save everything I’ll circle back to that in next weeks’ article.In the meantime, I want to make reference to the impact continuing to save a % of your income into your pension after a pay rise is, because its’ important.Pay Raise  PensionsSome people who receive a pay increase but make no % change to their pension contribution, think they are making progress, because they are saving a higher amount, right Wrong.If you continue to save for example % of your income, of course you’re increasing your saving because it’s % of a higher amount, butyou spend the other % and continue to do so, you are increasing your standard of living by % of every rise you receive.The danger with doing this, is that as your standard of living rises, the funding needed for retirement grows at a faster pace than the amount you are saving. Which results in the gap between what you need and what you save, becoming bigger every year.Let me explain.Let’s say your income was €, and it increased to €,.If you were saving % of your salary and continue to do so after your raise, you are increasing your annual contributions by €,, and you’re now saving €, per year.Whilst you might be saving more in absolute terms i.e. % of €, is obviously more than % of €,, you need to save more relative to how much your new salary is,you want to keep up with your new, higher costing lestyle.In this instance,you save % of your raise i.e. €, and add it to what you were previously saving i.e. €,, your new annual saving rate is €,.That % saving from your raise increases your contributions to, % of your new salary and that’s why you’re giving yourself an opportunity to fast forward retirement.What all that means is that the increased retirement savings, combined with the decreased need for retirement funds, means someone aged  who saves % of their raise can retire at , which is  years earlier than someone of the same age who only saved % of their raise.Regardless of your age, continuing to save only a certain % of your salary and spending the rest, including raises, is really poor advice because it can lead to delayed retirement and underfunded accounts, and that’s’ even when your savings rate is higher.Long story short, getting a raise can actually exacerbate the problem of having a fund which is lower than you need when you decide to retire full stop. Instinctively you might think it will help because you’re saving more money.But don’t forget you’re spending more as well and how are you going to replace that You’re certainly not going to do ityou continue to save the same % your currently saving.And let me repeat, even though you’re saving more because its % of a higher amount, when you run the math, it will tell you a dferent story.Okay, next week, I’ll look at people who are carrying high debt and or low savings and I’ll give you my opinion on how much of any raise they receive, they should spend.And in the same article, I’ll also tell you about someone who asked me recently what impact the raise she received would have on her finances. She wanted specic numbers and outputs on a number of dferent areas, and I’ll share with you what we discovered, and what she decided to do.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

It started with  pupils in a scout centre.  In this article the Principal of Oakgrove Integrated College, Katrina Crilly, explains why she is so passionate about her school and about its founding principles that, she says, are all about teaching pupils respect for the ersity that’s out there... googletag.cmd.push  As many of you probably know, integrated education here has been around for a long time. This year it’s celebrating its ruby anniversary - it’s  years since Lagan College was established in Belfast. Last week we celebrated this by inviting the Mayor and MP for Foyle to unveil our banner. Surprisingly, despite recent media coverage about the founding of Lagan, it would seem that integration is still largely misunderstood. Here in Northern Ireland  North of Ireland, it’s taken to mean a school where Catholic and Protestant children are educated together. It’s much, much more than that. In today’s global world, we’re confronted with a whole host of ersity: dferent cultures, dferent religions, dferent skin colours. Here at our school, Oakgrove College, we prepare our students to meet and deal with that ersity by providing a learning environment where children and young people from all faiths and none can learn with, about and most importantly from each other. Acceptance and respect for all are key concepts in everything we do. Our desire for every child who joins the Oakgrove family is the promotion of equality, and that must include the forging good relations with everyone in the school and their families regardless of their religious, cultural, social or other background. Integrated education is, at its core, value-driven and child centred. It is delivered through a holistic approach.     Our world, as I have pointed out, is full of ersity that’s the natural law, and so children deserve the opportunity to flourish in that erse environment both at school and in wider society. How  are children supposed to learn about other cultures and backgrounds enough that they understand and accept dference as a natural part of le  We are about preparing children for le and work, providing children with a very real experience of living and working successfully alongside people from dferent backgrounds and beliefs. Many believe that all schools are integrated, but what they actually mean is that they are “mixed”. The two are very dferent. Dferent backgrounds Many schools accept children from dferent faiths and backgrounds and, yes, they are educated alongside each other and under one roof. However, the school does not change its ethos or identity for that child, there is an understanding that the child can attend however the school’s religious ethos remains the same and the child “fits in”. In some respects, the child sacrices their identity to attend the school. In an integrated school, no child has to sacrice their identity to attend, as all backgrounds and faiths, and all our dferences are celebrated and nurtured. At an integrated school no child has to deny his her culture, background or religion. Imagine a place where you can honestly be yourself, where your dference is celebrated as the norm, and where you grow in the knowledge and understanding that we are all equal. This is on top of achieving high academic outcomes and successful career paths. That place doesn’t have to be imagined: it is here – in an integrated school. It is certainly true that all schools provide the NI curriculum and will provide broadly the same extra-curricular activities, but an integrated school will give this and more. Only in an integrated school will children see what is familiar from their background but also learn what is unfamiliar to them, but “the norm” for others in the class. It’s a fact that this is the only place in the world where parents set up their own schools. They did so because of a passionate belief that, after years of conflict, we could only help to solve the communal ides in this society by bringing people together. In September,  Lagan College opened its doors.  years on can we say we are truly the mixed society they wanted us to be  We have, I would suggest, still some road to travel! But the journey is worth the effort. And as Principal of Oakgrove Integrated College, I can say we are committed to making our contribution. Within our school, there is real excitement amongst staff and pupils about learning, and excitement about learning from and with each other. Integrated education brings people together as children, and keeps people together for le.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bank of Ireland branch at Strand Road is to close its doors today..Derry NewsA sad day - Bank of Ireland Strand Road branch in Derry to close their doors today for the last time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

Colm Cusack, a founding member of Destined and until recently the services Secretary and a member on its Board of Directors. He was also the Centre Manager when the group was based in Great James Street and was responsible for everything from a tea bag to toilet roll. googletag.cmd.push He has been described as the face of Destined for visitors calling to the centre who would often receive a complimentary cup of tea. Colm headed up the older peoples group and organised many activities such as visits to the Bowling Alley, the Millennium Forum and Playhouse, restaurants and bars throughout the city. He was involved every year in the preparations for the St Patricks Day and Halloween parades. Colm was also instrumental in setting up the Friendship Club and supported the older members to undertake training to learn how to use mobile phones, how to text and email, and how to access the internet to reduce their levels of isolation.  Colm Cusack celebrates his retirement clients and staff at Destined. PHOTOS: Tom Heaney, nwpresspics  The new North West Learning Disability Centre was named the Cusack Centre in recognition of all the work that Colm has contributed to the learning disability community in the city. Speaking at the presentation, Destineds Dermot O’Hara said: “Colm has been a mainstay of the group since it started. He was the first person you met in the morning and always had a joke or laugh to share with everyone. “He will be missed in the coming future but we want him to know that he will always be welcome to call into Destined. I want to wish him well for the future and hope that he has a healthy and good retirement.”    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bank of Ireland branch at Strand Road is to close its doors today..Derry NewsA sad day - Bank of Ireland Strand Road branch in Derry to close their doors today for the last time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

Mohamad Ali, who runs the Maiden Heaven cafe in Waterloo Place, said his shops logo bears a “a striking resemblance” to the Parachute Regiment’s. On Bloody Sunday, soldiers of the Parachute Regiment were responsible for killing  innocent civilians in the city, another man died from his injuries months later. googletag.cmd.push Since then the Parachute Regiment and its flag has proven to be a contentious issue in the city. Flags can seen displayed in loyalist ares of the city in support of Solider F, who had been charged with the murder of Bloody Sunday victims William McKinney and James Wray. At an Apprentice Boys of Derry parade in , the Clyde Valley Flute Band caused controversy when theymarched through the city wearing the insignia with the letter F underneath. The flag has also been burned on bonfires in nationalist ares of the city. Mr Ali said he would never have used the logo, featuring an ice cream cone and wings, had he realised the similarity between it and the insignia the regiment. The shops barriers at its outdoor seated area also features the similar maroon colouring to berets worn by Parachute Regiment soldiers and flags featuring its insignia of an open parachute with wings. In a post on Facebook, owner Mr Ali, apologised for the logo and said that he’s “working to change it”. He said: “It has been brought to my attention over the last few days by few good friends that the logo for Maiden Heaven coffee shop and ice cream bears a striking resemblance to the Parachute Regiment insignia.     “Given the history of this city and the fact that the Parachute Regiment shot dead innocent people on the streets of Derry, I would NEVER have knowingly used a logo that would offend or hurt the people of this city that I love and the city that has been my home over the last  years. I am working now to change this. And sorryanyone was offended by this logo and color, I would never have used it to promote my business had I realised the similarity.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bank of Ireland branch at Strand Road is to close its doors today..Derry NewsA sad day - Bank of Ireland Strand Road branch in Derry to close their doors today for the last time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

Mohamad Ali, who runs the Maiden Heaven cafe in Waterloo Place, said his shops logo bears a “a striking resemblance” to the Parachute Regiment’s. On Bloody Sunday, soldiers of the Parachute Regiment were responsible for killing  innocent civilians in the city, another man died from his injuries months later. googletag.cmd.push Since then the Parachute Regiment and its flag has proven to be a contentious issue in the city. Flags can seen displayed in loyalist ares of the city in support of Solider F, who had been charged with the murder of Bloody Sunday victims William McKinney and James Wray. At an Apprentice Boys of Derry parade in , the Clyde Valley Flute Band caused controversy when theymarched through the city wearing the insignia with the letter F underneath. The flag has also been burned on bonfires in nationalist ares of the city. Mr Ali said he would never have used the logo, featuring an ice cream cone and wings, had he realised the similarity between it and the insignia the regiment. The shops barriers at its outdoor seated area also features the similar maroon colouring to berets worn by Parachute Regiment soldiers and flags featuring its insignia of an open parachute with wings. In a post on Facebook, owner Mr Ali, apologised for the logo and said that he’s “working to change it”. He said: “It has been brought to my attention over the last few days by few good friends that the logo for Maiden Heaven coffee shop and ice cream bears a striking resemblance to the Parachute Regiment insignia.     “Given the history of this city and the fact that the Parachute Regiment shot dead innocent people on the streets of Derry, I would NEVER have knowingly used a logo that would offend or hurt the people of this city that I love and the city that has been my home over the last  years. I am working now to change this. And sorryanyone was offended by this logo and color, I would never have used it to promote my business had I realised the similarity.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bank of Ireland branch at Strand Road is to close its doors today..Derry NewsA sad day - Bank of Ireland Strand Road branch in Derry to close their doors today for the last time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

The bank is ceasing services at  branches in the north of the the country, and a further  locations in the Republic as part of signicant changes to its branch network and local banking services first announced in March. googletag.cmd.push As part of the major restructuring of the bank, the Strand Road branch will close with customers still able to avail of services at the Culmore Road branch. Additionally, the branch in Limavady will also close, as well as branches in Strabane and Moville in County Donegal. It said that over the last three years, there has been a % drop in the number of customers visiting the branches in question, with a rise in those using online services. Bank of Ireland said an arrangement with the Post Offce, to allow for lodgements and withdrawals, will protect local access to over-the-counter banking, allowing account holders to conduct transactions at post offices around the country. Our personal customers may use any Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques, withdraw money using their debit card and check balances. Business Customers can use Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques withdraw money and check their balance with their Bank of Ireland UK Business Debit Card. Varying limits will apply to cash transactions, we will support customers to set up new arrangements including coin and larger cash transactions and are also planning to enhance services later this year.     Customers affected by the closures have been written to in recent months, informing them of the changes and outlining where their accounts will be transferred to. Account numbers, sort codes, along with direct debits and standing order arrangements, will remain in place. While most of the branches being closed have post offices nearby, customers wanting to access other Bank of Ireland services may now have to travel signicant distances to their closest branch. Revealed: Full list of  Bank of Ireland branch closures https:t.co DztGNaBSb — Irish Examiner October ,     The Financial Services Unionhas described the closures as a sad day for staff and customers and a real sign of the weakness of regulation in Ireland. John OConnell, General Secretary of the FSU, said Despite cross party opposition in the Daacuteil and in Stormont and across wide sections of the community, Bank of Ireland have continued along the pathway of eroding their footprint and removing vital services from communities across our country, The Regulator has clearly failed in its role of protecting customers and communities in this instance, he added. Mr. OConnell said the withdrawal of ATMs will mean there will be communities next week which will no longer have   access to cash adding that despite the increase in card payments, cash remains a vital payment method for customers. The FSU has called on the Central Bank to open a consultation paper on the future access to cash to ensure that the use of this access is safeguarded. It also called for the urgent consideration whether legislation and new enforcement powers are required in this area. Our banking sector is at a crossroads and needs a commitment from the Central Bank that the banking network will not disappear, and that they will be proactive in ensuring that communities and vulnerable people will not once again be hit the hardest, Mr OConnell added.

The bank is ceasing services at  branches in the north of the the country, and a further  locations in the Republic as part of signicant changes to its branch network and local banking services first announced in March. googletag.cmd.push As part of the major restructuring of the bank, the Strand Road branch will close with customers still able to avail of services at the Culmore Road branch. Additionally, the branch in Limavady will also close, as well as branches in Strabane and Moville in County Donegal. It said that over the last three years, there has been a % drop in the number of customers visiting the branches in question, with a rise in those using online services. Bank of Ireland said an arrangement with the Post Offce, to allow for lodgements and withdrawals, will protect local access to over-the-counter banking, allowing account holders to conduct transactions at post offices around the country. Our personal customers may use any Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques, withdraw money using their debit card and check balances. Business Customers can use Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques withdraw money and check their balance with their Bank of Ireland UK Business Debit Card. Varying limits will apply to cash transactions, we will support customers to set up new arrangements including coin and larger cash transactions and are also planning to enhance services later this year.     Customers affected by the closures have been written to in recent months, informing them of the changes and outlining where their accounts will be transferred to. Account numbers, sort codes, along with direct debits and standing order arrangements, will remain in place. While most of the branches being closed have post offices nearby, customers wanting to access other Bank of Ireland services may now have to travel signicant distances to their closest branch. Revealed: Full list of  Bank of Ireland branch closures https:t.co DztGNaBSb — Irish Examiner October ,     The Financial Services Unionhas described the closures as a sad day for staff and customers and a real sign of the weakness of regulation in Ireland. John OConnell, General Secretary of the FSU, said Despite cross party opposition in the Daacuteil and in Stormont and across wide sections of the community, Bank of Ireland have continued along the pathway of eroding their footprint and removing vital services from communities across our country, The Regulator has clearly failed in its role of protecting customers and communities in this instance, he added. Mr. OConnell said the withdrawal of ATMs will mean there will be communities next week which will no longer have   access to cash adding that despite the increase in card payments, cash remains a vital payment method for customers. The FSU has called on the Central Bank to open a consultation paper on the future access to cash to ensure that the use of this access is safeguarded. It also called for the urgent consideration whether legislation and new enforcement powers are required in this area. Our banking sector is at a crossroads and needs a commitment from the Central Bank that the banking network will not disappear, and that they will be proactive in ensuring that communities and vulnerable people will not once again be hit the hardest, Mr OConnell added.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner.

Donna McLenaghan, who lives in Smiths Falls, Ontario, is hoping to find out more about the family of her great great grandparents who left County Derry for Perth, Canada in the s. googletag.cmd.push Charles McLenaghan and his we Annboth lived in the Dungiven area prior to emigrating.  “My ancestors were originally from Derry, Ireland. They lived around Dungiven before emigrating to Canada,” explained Donna. “The family name is McLenaghan and my great great grandmother who married into the family was an Osbourne and the Osbournes owned an estate called Altmover.” Donna says, according to parish records, the McLenaghans lived in a tract known as Boveva on lands they leased from a family named Carey. They lived there for many generations, which is proved by a lease from Captain Arthur Carey, dated , to Robert McLenaghan of Ballycargan, of the whole townland of Ballycargan Manor of Pellipan for  years. Records also show that many of the McLenaghan clan were schoolmasters and generally were people of superior education. The Osbourne family, whom were also prominent in the district, were originally English, coming from Leeds.  Their estate in County Derry was called Altmover and they were squires and landlords of the neighbourhood. Altmover remained in their possession until the twentieth century, the estate being broken up in .     Ann Osbourne, who was a daughter of the family and heiress to the estate, married Charles McLenaghan. They went on to have a son, named Nathaniel, who married a woman called Jane Morris from County Wexford.  The family then emigrated to Canada. Donna says another of her ancestors, Mary McLenaghanalso emigrated to Canada with their five sons. One of her sons was called Robert Meighan, who married the sister of George Stephen, the first president of Canadian Pacic Railway. She says Robert worked with his brother-in-law to negotiate rail lines between Perth, Ontario and Toronto.  He was also involved in other business and went on to buy a renaissance mansion from his brother-in-law which was called George Stephen House, also referred to as Mount Stephen Club. It has been used by ious Hollywood stars for shooting period films. Donna is now keen to piece together her family tree and hopes to reconnect with others in the area who may have connections to her ancestors. “I decided to trace my family roots out of a very keen desire to find out more about my family roots and possibly connect with relatives that may still be living in the area. “Im also very interested in my great great grandmother Ann Osbournes family as theres mention of it being the same name as the Dukes of Leeds and I wondershe was related to them.” Donna says she hopes to travel to Ireland soon and intends to make a visit to County Derry to visit the area where her ancestors were born. “I havent visited the area although I was hoping to while on a trip to England in  and have had the desire to for many years and hope to do so in the very near future. I feel such a closeness to Ireland as well as the UK since this is the region that my ancestors are from.”  Consultation to be opened on County Derry Park and Ride  Minister for Infrastructure Nichola Mallon has announced the move.

Ambition is important. Yes, that’s true. Without a level of ambition, in the modern world, we would probably be lost. We wouldn’t be sure where to go or what to do next and of course what we would like to accomplish. googletag.cmd.push The word ambition has a dferent meaning for everyone. For one person it may mean to be in good health. For another, it may mean to rise to the top of the corporate ladder. Or maybe you want to be the best parent you can be. But sometimes, ambition makes us blind and we lose sight of the reasons behind this initial ambition. Chasing something is an example of how we lose sight in the fog of ambition. Where it turns to: “I don’t have enough in le currently or presently”. Be it, more cars, more money, more houses etc. This is where ambition turns to the need for more and more. The want of “more” unfortunately will never satisfy any of us. It may have its fleeting moments of happiness where the ego becomes your shadow side - meaning that it is lurking somewhere in the background, having more control over your thoughts, feelings and actions than you may initially think. Ego is important. I would argue that it is detrimental to our happiness and fulfillment, in a physical and mental sense, when we are blinded by the ego and all it wants for us is more of something or maybe even someone.     Our ultimate mission is inidual to each and every one of us however our mission or purpose does share commonalities. We are inspired when we think of our mission. We are frightened of our mission as we are afraid of what we truly know we can accomplish once we put our minds to it. We get a sense of happiness at the thought of our mission being complete. Overall, there may be a procrastinating pull and a satisfactory push when we think of what our purpose is,we have not found it yet or taking action towards it. Society is not designed in a way for us to find our purpose and true calling. We have to go and find it ourselves. Efficiency has led to a personal deficiency where being proactive is admired and recognised more so than a person’s recognition for the need to rest. Let’s look at a question we often ask others: “Are you busy ” Questioning the “busyness” of someone  is a worthwhile example of how we are conditioned into framing conversations and boxing another human being’s value into whether they are “busy” or not. Yes, while it may be a good way to start conversation, I would question this very question as a measure of efficiency in our daily lives as existential as it may be. We have to question these things and examine where we can improve on our ways of interacting socially leading to meaningful friendships and relationships. I don’t mean that on an efficiency level but more on a deeper, human connection level Nobody has this le figured out. Many people are seen to be thought leaders in self-help, for example, but they don’t have it figured out either. Whilst the conceptualisation of certain ideas may provoke thought and conversation , nobody has it fully figured out and each one of us are on our own inidual path. I say this to support the idea that there seems to always be a drive toward efficiency in the modern world and this can now be seen in new thought leadership on self-help. We now have step by step guides, habits, graphs, routines etc. that tell us how to be more efficient - from people who certainly, although maybe experienced, do not have the answers you or I seek. Efficiency, in my eyes, is the curse to simplicity which I believe is one of the keys to living a happy, stress free le. When we strip back layers of the ego’s needs, what are we left with  I would assume that we are left with a very fragile, vulnerable and lost person which is why we need to have a certain level of ego in our lives. However, we can be mindful of what aspects of the ego we tend to build. So in an ego driven world that almost demands efficiency, leads to a spiritual and mental deficiency where we may forget to nurture certain aspects of ourselves. I would advocate a strategy that would be congruent to your overall daily set of values or importantly your sense of purpose or your mission. For example: “My mission is to be a great mother”. Firstly, define what “great mother” means to you. Does it mean fulfilling the basic food, shelter, emotional needs of your child or does it surpass that  Whatever your purpose, define what success means to you, not the world’s demand for efficiency. Overall, an Americanised, McDonalds culture of “getting stuff done” has filtered its way into most of the Western world. Whilst efficiency is welcome in certain aspects of our lives, be it our cars, coffee machines and checkouts - at what point do we press the stop button on a robotic like efficiency that we human beings have also now become accustomed to in our relationship with ourselves and others  It takes strength and often courage to get off the hamster wheel - be it your self-sabotaging belief systems, patterns of destructive behavior, your career, the role in your relationships - however, I would strongly advocate stepping back from the busy demands of le and re-evaluating what it is you really value.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bank of Ireland branch at Strand Road is to close its doors today..Derry NewsA sad day - Bank of Ireland Strand Road branch in Derry to close their doors today for the last time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

The window when the sporting acumen of the local community was dissected with a fine tooth comb. The reserves took the field at two oclock in front of one man and a dog. And by the time the game headed for the final furlong, cars would be trickling in the lane for the senior game. Elbows on the wire, the elder statesmen of the club would surmise who the best reserve players were. googletag.cmd.push “Yer man would need to take a look at Johnny,” one might offer. “Hes lording it out there.” There would be a nod back. Sport is all about opinion. With more people filing into the ground, the noise level will go up. Enter the club time-bomb. We all know them. The sort who would argue a black cat white. The man from the opposing club, who was acting as linesman, would have his line ball decision questioned. And all of a sudden chests would be pumped out and a mouthful of choice words exchanged. Often, it sets the tone for the senior game. But the double header gives reserve players an identity. Some will stay togged out for the seniors. Others will get the disco shoes and the hair gel slapped on for the few scoops down the pub later. Some will huff and puff that the senior manager doesnt rate them. A few weeks back, I was in Owenbeg for Newbridges win over Coleraine. Being early, I mixed typing up a few match reports with watching the reserve game. Alan Nash let it flow from end to end, with the senior managers looking on before taking their squad away to prepare for the main event.     There was just that united feel to it all. A group of players who trained on Tuesday and Thursday night, went to the gym together, slagged each other in the same Whats App group during the week, they were all on an even keel. Give or take a man or two, Newbridge have a senior reserve  of  training most nights. Coleraines  sits around the  or  bracket. Its the most theyve had in ages offers Ryan McGeough, their affable two-time championship winning goalkeeper who has now stepped into the role as club Chairman. Mathematically, double headers are not a problem here. But it makes for a juggling act. Newbridge manager Killian Conlan offers the conundrum of how many players to hold off reserve duty. Most clubs are the same. Who am I Iikely to use in the senior game  And its not an exact science. It brings me back to the days of watching Sunday double headers. Being taken off in the reserve game was an elevation in status. “I told ye....Johnnymust be in the senior managers plans,” offers the club stalwart. This is the problem with being the fringe player. Youre caught between two stools. Half a game here, five or ten minutes there. Formation changes, injuries, black cards and poor performance all need to be thought through. The players caught in the middle can miss out on action. The four Newbridge senior subswere held off reserve duty, including Mickey ONeill who came on with minutes to go in a game that was decided while he was on the pitch. His chasing back helped force a turnover on the way to the Bridges winning point In a scenario like Newbridge, moving up the pecking order in the Derry club scene is their mantra. Men caught in the middle just have to ride it out and push like mad for a senior place. Odhran McGlones brief was to put Sean Leo McGoldrick on the back foot, which he did with four points in an all-action  minute performance before his fuel light began to flash and PJ ONeill came in to keep them ticking towards the finish line. The Bridge were the only team guaranteed to finish top of their group before a ball was kicked at the weekend. Would they have got over the line against Coleraine without fresh legs  Thats debatable. The previous night, Sean Cassidy came on in the th minute of Slaughtneils defeat to Lavey. Having played in the reserve game, he was back in action again and fisted over a point within minutes of coming on. Every clubs circumstances are dferent. There are dual clubs, there are suspensions and there is Covid. Its all rosyyou have the numbers. Sideline View conducted a mini poll of club senior  sizes, not counting short-term injuries or any Covid- related unavailability. With the exception of Claudys  of , the other  Division A clubs have a senior  capable to fielding senior and reserve teams on the same day. Of the  responses,  squads had  players or more to fuel a senior and reserve team. A further three were in the middle bracket –  to . At junior and the lower end of intermediate level, the story is totally dferent. The remaining  clubs, were under the  number required to field two teams in one day, without needing to coax a few retired players back to fill out the team to ensure everybody gets football. Concessions dominate the results pages. Of the  intermediate reserve championship group games fixed, only four were played. Four. It has been really sore on clubs who have the numbers. On top of their senior squad of , Steelstown have a reserve  of . With the need to grow GAA in the city, not having a reserve championship game leaves it very dficult to maintain player retention. Why stay when other sports can offer more. Castledawson, Faughanvale, Glenullin and Drumsurn are other intermediate teams who didnt get their full compliment of games. Intermediate champions Greenlough had a recent in-house  versus  game, with nine substitutes. Their reserves have had a in one game in almost nine weeks. In many cases, clubs cannot field a senior and reserve team on the same night. Midweek reserve fixtures at . leave it impossible for some to get home from work on time, taking the numbers even lower again. The reserve and senior double headers of old at the weekend give the best chance toto the status quo. As this column has alluded to in the past, Saturday evening would be a better option. But it doesnt suit everyone. With a fluid situation, there needs to be a look at the future of reserve football and where it fits. Clubs should only enter a teamthey can fulfil their games and allow the CCC to restructure. For example, Desertmartin seniors are playing in the junior ranks, yet have a squad of  and traditionally were always very successful at intermediate reserve championship level. Clubs could be asked for their input into how everything could fit together. Senior managers, with input from their club committees, should look into – and be accommodated by the CCC – moving their reserve game to a dferent night, possibly a training night. One of the management team could take charge of the reserves and everyone  trains. When Ronan Rocks was in charge of Desertmartin, he phoned ahead every week to request a Friday reserve fixture. It was almost always accepted. Stephen Barker, the CCC Chairman at the time, was only too glad to accommodate it and inform the referee of the revised fixture. It takes a bit of give and take between clubs, but overall it would be a step in the right direction. Andone club fails to agree a move, then the fixture remains as it is. The days of two and half three on a Sunday have gone forever in certain quarters. The next step is to make sure the level of conceded reserve games disappears until everyone is playing on a regular basis. That has to be the goal, for the long-term future of clubs.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bank of Ireland branch at Strand Road is to close its doors today..Derry NewsA sad day - Bank of Ireland Strand Road branch in Derry to close their doors today for the last time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

Fred chose Chupacandra Wizard Bull, bred by Helena Mudrova, as the top female Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Reporter: Matthew Leslie Oct Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Derry canine judge, Fred Jones flew out to the Czech Republic last week to cast his expert eye in selecting who would be the Worlds top dog. Fred, , who is also a self-employed joiner, has been part of the dog show scene for close to two decades, both in the capacity of showing dogs at competitions as well as judging them. googletag.cmd.push The breed he specialises in are Staffordshire Bull Terriers which he passes judgement over using strict Kennel Club criteria. Last week he was at the World Dog Show in Brno, Czech Republic, where he had to pick a winner from  entrants in the female Staffordshire Bull Terrier category. The one he picked was a Stafford named, Chupacandra Wizard Bull, who is owned by Czech breeder, Helena Mudrova. Fred enjoys his role as a dog judge but said its a long process before you can get to cover World shows as he does. He said: “You become a dog judge through your peers. Basically, you start off showing dogs and eventually, after a few years, somebody will invite you to judge at lower level competitions. “Once you do that, theres Kennel Club exams, seminars and certain criteria you have to meet. Its a progressive thing as it takes many years to work your way up to becoming a championship show judge. “From showing to judging my first ever low-level competition took me about four years. That was in . “In , I judged my first Irish championship. Ive travelled a bit now and Ive been to thirteen countries to judge. The World Show was a very prestigious one to get.     “All dogs are judged on their breed standard as laid down by the Kennel Club which all those showing the dogs have to adhere to. Thats basically covers everything about the dog. “I judged the female Staffordshire Bulls in the World show in Brno which had a total of ninety-nine entrants. “You had dferent classes as well such as Intermediate, Junior class, Open class and winners get a ticket towards an International Beauty title show – of which a dog needs three.” Fred knows what is required for a dog to win a competition having showed dogs himself at the highest level.  Fred Jones with his legendary champion dog, Lackyle Diabhal Og in  He added: “I have showed dogs myself in both Ireland and the UK extensively. There was a dog, named Lackyle Diabhal Og, that I owned that became UK, Irish and International champion. “Hes sadly no longer with us. He was a very famous dog – he produced more champions than any other Stafford in the history of breeding in Ireland. He was also top Terrier stud dog in the UK in . “Two years ago, I showed the grandson of that dog, named Caymenstaffs Blackthorn, which somebody in Scotland owns and he became a champion. He won a Reserve CCat Crufts. “I bought my first Staffordshire bull terrier as a school boy in . I joined my local Staffordshire bull terrier club in  I first became secretary of the club in  held many positions since then including secretary for the second time for the last ten years. “My first judging appointment was in  my first overseas appointment was the Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club of Queensland Australia in . “I have now judged my breed on twenty eight occasions in twelve countries, nineteen of these were breed club appointed shows and I also awarded CACIBin Italy in .”  Fred with Lackyles grandson, Caymenstaffs Blackthorn, who was one of the winners at Crufts in  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bank of Ireland branch at Strand Road is to close its doors today..Derry NewsA sad day - Bank of Ireland Strand Road branch in Derry to close their doors today for the last time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

Fred chose Chupacandra Wizard Bull, bred by Helena Mudrova, as the top female Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Reporter: Matthew Leslie Oct Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Derry canine judge, Fred Jones flew out to the Czech Republic last week to cast his expert eye in selecting who would be the Worlds top dog. Fred, , who is also a self-employed joiner, has been part of the dog show scene for close to two decades, both in the capacity of showing dogs at competitions as well as judging them. googletag.cmd.push The breed he specialises in are Staffordshire Bull Terriers which he passes judgement over using strict Kennel Club criteria. Last week he was at the World Dog Show in Brno, Czech Republic, where he had to pick a winner from  entrants in the female Staffordshire Bull Terrier category. The one he picked was a Stafford named, Chupacandra Wizard Bull, who is owned by Czech breeder, Helena Mudrova. Fred enjoys his role as a dog judge but said its a long process before you can get to cover World shows as he does. He said: “You become a dog judge through your peers. Basically, you start off showing dogs and eventually, after a few years, somebody will invite you to judge at lower level competitions. “Once you do that, theres Kennel Club exams, seminars and certain criteria you have to meet. Its a progressive thing as it takes many years to work your way up to becoming a championship show judge. “From showing to judging my first ever low-level competition took me about four years. That was in . “In , I judged my first Irish championship. Ive travelled a bit now and Ive been to thirteen countries to judge. The World Show was a very prestigious one to get.     “All dogs are judged on their breed standard as laid down by the Kennel Club which all those showing the dogs have to adhere to. Thats basically covers everything about the dog. “I judged the female Staffordshire Bulls in the World show in Brno which had a total of ninety-nine entrants. “You had dferent classes as well such as Intermediate, Junior class, Open class and winners get a ticket towards an International Beauty title show – of which a dog needs three.” Fred knows what is required for a dog to win a competition having showed dogs himself at the highest level.  Fred Jones with his legendary champion dog, Lackyle Diabhal Og in  He added: “I have showed dogs myself in both Ireland and the UK extensively. There was a dog, named Lackyle Diabhal Og, that I owned that became UK, Irish and International champion. “Hes sadly no longer with us. He was a very famous dog – he produced more champions than any other Stafford in the history of breeding in Ireland. He was also top Terrier stud dog in the UK in . “Two years ago, I showed the grandson of that dog, named Caymenstaffs Blackthorn, which somebody in Scotland owns and he became a champion. He won a Reserve CCat Crufts. “I bought my first Staffordshire bull terrier as a school boy in . I joined my local Staffordshire bull terrier club in  I first became secretary of the club in  held many positions since then including secretary for the second time for the last ten years. “My first judging appointment was in  my first overseas appointment was the Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club of Queensland Australia in . “I have now judged my breed on twenty eight occasions in twelve countries, nineteen of these were breed club appointed shows and I also awarded CACIBin Italy in .”  Fred with Lackyles grandson, Caymenstaffs Blackthorn, who was one of the winners at Crufts in  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bank of Ireland branch at Strand Road is to close its doors today..Derry NewsA sad day - Bank of Ireland Strand Road branch in Derry to close their doors today for the last time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

The cross-border cycle path and walkway looked to have been halted in its tracks back in June when planning permission for the first phase of the project had been rejected. The Councils main concerns back then were fears of the potential impact that the greenway could have on future housing development in the Buncrana Road area of Derry. googletag.cmd.push However, the green light has now received approval and Cllr Duffy expressed her delight at the news. She said “This greenway route is part of the North West Greenway Network Scheme which collectively will deliver .km of shared pedestrian and cycle paths on a cross border basis. “We need to reduce our reliance on petrol and diesel vehicles and for people to be able to make the choice to use more sustainable forms of transport. Infrastructure like this needs to be in place. “This application should be viewed alongside a similar application that is being worked on by Donegal Council that will eventually bring the greenway from St Columbs College right through to Buncrana.”    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bank of Ireland branch at Strand Road is to close its doors today..Derry NewsA sad day - Bank of Ireland Strand Road branch in Derry to close their doors today for the last time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

Councillors on Causeway Coast and Glens Leisure and Development Committee approved a date and location for the International Air Show event to be held in . googletag.cmd.push The event is set to take place on the weekend of September  and , with the flight path to be centred between the towns of Portstewart and Portrush. However, Sinn Feacutein raised concerns over an absence of budget projections on a report presented to the Committee, and during an ill-tempered spat among councillors, proposed a further report be brought. Cllr Leanne Peacock Ballymoney Sinn Feacutein councillor Leanne Peacock said the council had shown a dereliction of duty. “Weve got to this stage, agreeing specic details of this project, but were yet to have a single estimate provided to this council for what it will cost us,” she told the council. “As custodians of the public purse, its a complete dereliction of our duty to proceed without a single estimate of what this will cost our rate payers. “We have seen where such reckless decision-making has got us in the past. This council has spent thousands on consultancy fees a year before the event. “Its outrageous that members are not being provided with the most basic detail to make decisions the cost, which is usually the starting point.”     Cllr Peacock proposed a report be brought back to the Leisure and Development Committee with costings included, along with details of affordability checks carried out on the proposal. Council Mayor Richard Holmes pointed out a report with costings was already due to come back to the Committee, before opening the floor to speakers. Council officer Richard Baker said the event was still in the early stages of planning. “What weve done is set the foundation of the event the date and the location. There has been no discussion about the specics through the working group,” he said. “That will be developed and worked through the project board set up for the International Air Show in .” Cllr Aaron Callan has been central to the Air Shows planning. Limavady councillor Aaron Callan expressed his frustration with the Sinn Feacutein response to the event. “From day dot, Sinn Feacutein have opposed the air show in any form. Its not based on finances its based on ideological opposition to the fact that the RAF would be involved,” said the DUP councillor. “These events draw visitors into our area, that support the businesses that pay their rates, and the Air Show is a critical part of that going forward. “If Sinn Feacutein were so concerned about it, they would have appointed someone to the working group, which they refused to do.” Cllr James McCorkell Independent councillor for Limavady, James McCorkell, referred to a comment by Cllr Dermot Nicholl at last months committee about the event being linked to the Queens Platinum Jubilee. “At least Dermot at the meeting said she wasnt his Queen – fair enough. Call a spade a spade. I might not like it, but stop the nonsense, for goodness sake,” he said. “Just say you dont want it. Dont come up with excuses and nonsense about estimates. Weve held this air show for numerous years the estimates are already there,” added the former DUP representative.

Mr Colhoun, who lives at Somme Park near Altnagelvin, scooped the prize – awarded by Clanmil Housing Group – for his and the rest of his six-strong gardening teams work on the housing schemes garden. The annual Clanmil in Bloom competition highlights the hard work that goes into making the gardens at Clanmil housing schemes look pristine. googletag.cmd.push It recognises people who take a keen interest in keeping the green spaces around their homes looking the very best they can and gives green-fingered tenants a chance to showcase their handiwork. Mr Colhoun, a tenant at Somme Park, was presented with his award by Paul Fiddaman, Chair of Clanmil Housing, at a special celebration at The Clayton Hotel in Belfast. John is one of a team of six keen gardeners who tend the Somme Park site. He described accepting the award on their behalf as “a great privilege.” He said: “We love watching Monty Don on Gardener’s World and the Cha Flower Show to get tips and ideas – like planting strips of wildflowers instead of having all grass. Our fuchsia is doing very well this year.” As well as growing flowers at Somme Park, the gardeners have also created raised beds where they grow vegetables and have created pathways to make them wheelchair accessible for other tenants. John added: “We have peas, potatoes, gooseberries, red currants, courgettes and peppers.” “We even had a vine growing, but the wee birds and robins ate all the grapes.” John, who used to be a beekeeper, has always had an interest in gardening. He described how important getting out into the garden was to him during the lockdown.     He continued: “I find gardening very therapeutic, and it is a social thing too. The lockdown was a real hard time, and it was important to get to know your neighbours and check in with them to seethey were OK. “At Somme Park everyone looks out for each other, and we all have a bit of craic now in the common room.” Claire Darby, Senior Engagement Officer said, People who live in Clanmil homes love spending time in their gardens and many people across our schemes have spent a lot of time during lockdown in their outside spaces. “The Clanmil in Bloom awards event allows us to celebrate all their achievements and to recognise the great work they have done towards creating that special outdoor place.” Clare McCarty, Group Chief Executive at Clanmil, added: “Credit is due to all the participants, the judges and to Greentown Environmental – our grounds maintenance contractors – who helped sponsor the competition. “The pride and passion that Clanmil people have for their homes and neighbourhoods is clear to see. “Congratulations to everyone who took part, and especially to all the winners.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bank of Ireland branch at Strand Road is to close its doors today..Derry NewsA sad day - Bank of Ireland Strand Road branch in Derry to close their doors today for the last time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

Acting through their solicitor, the Montagu Estate have issued a statement expressing regret that Portstewart Town Hall had been subject to years of neglect during its time under the control of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council. googletag.cmd.push The town hall sits on a number of sites provided by the Montagu Estate to the Portstewart townspeople, and the family have said much of the land had been abandoned by those responsible for it. Ever since John Cromie named Portstewart in  he and his successors, now the Montagu Estate, provided lands for specic amenities for the townspeople of Portstewart, they said. This seems to have been forgotten over the years. Our predecessors provided the Cromie Institute, land for the Warren Playing Fields, the Primary School, the Headland, the Crescent foreshore, the Harbour and other many other parcels of land some of which are now in dispute as they have been abandoned by those to whom they had been endowed. It is disappointing to us that the Town Hall has been allowed to fall into disrepair over so many years of neglect, causing the loss of this amenity to the townspeople of Portstewart that is sincerely felt by all. Independent councillor for the area, Angela Mulholland, said the community had reached out to the Montagu estate to attempt to find a solution.     The people of Portstewart are devastated at the prospect of losing our town hall, she said. We fully appreciate and share the disappointment and frustration felt by the Montagu family regarding Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councils stewardship of the town hall.

When contacted, Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council said they intended to issue a statement on the town hall next week. After the Special Council meeting where they approved the hand over after seeking legal advice, Mayor Richard Holmes said the community were free to negotiate with the Montagu Estate. ”The ownership of Portstewart Town Hall has been under detailed consideration by Council for over two years,” he said. “In March , the Council made a decision which was not challenged using any of the normal channels, either call-in or rescinding motion. “That decision was to acknowledge the Montagu Estate’s Notice to Quit and the nub of the issue here is the ownership of the building. “While the council is progressing with the hand back of the building, the community is free to negotiate with the Montagu Estate. “Preliminary work to establish the need for community space in Portstewart has already begun as proposed by council members.  Council accused of failing to do due diligence over town hall handover  A local community association has called on the Department for Communities to intervene.    County Derry community group ‘deeply disappointed’ by town hall handover  The group also expressed frustration that meetings were held in private.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.         Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.         Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

When asked for a reason for his stance, Robinson said: “I wouldn’t force people to do it, it’s your choice and your body.” googletag.cmd.push Ireland manager Stephen Kenny has defended his decision to pick the striker to play in Saturdays game saying it would be extremely radical to punish players with international exclusion for refusing to be vaccinated. I think for inidual associations to just come together to decide not to select any player that hasn’t got it would create as many problems,” added Kenny. “They’re problems we don’t need to have.” Joe Duffy opened the conversation on his show Liveline today which seemed to snowball into an argument between pro and anti vaxxers, with some callers slamming Joe for bullying the  year old Robinson. Shocking stuff from @joeliveline beretating Callum Robinson for not taking a covid vaccine. The HSE clearly state the longterm effects information are limited. No one should be hounded in to taking any medication-especially a still on trial one! #liveline — Karen Luby October ,     While others felt that Robinson shouldnt be allowed to play in Saturdays game. If you are not vaccinated you shouldn’t be playing for Ireland, unless you have proper medical reasons. #liveline — Cllr Declan Meenagh ️♿ #StayHomeSaveLives October ,     Commenters on Twitter were also quick to point out that since Callum Robinson has had Covid twice, he would surely have stronger immunity towards the virus. Joe is a dummy .. imagine covering this topic and not knowing that the player is recovered from covid and has more protection now than somebody vaccinated . Luke O Neill should be interviewed on the show to shut up those who don’t follow the science of natural immunity #Liveline          — samryan October ,     The FAI has since released the following statement: The Football Association of Ireland can confirm that all players and staff are tested for COVID- before reporting for international duty with Republic of Ireland teams and are tested repeatedly in camp in line with FAI and UEFA protocols. We have encouraged all our players at all levels of the game to be vaccinated but we respect and must accept the right of all iniduals to make a personal choice on COVID- vaccination. The Association will continue to exercise the highest standards for the safety of all our stakeholders. Our COVID- testing protocols for all players and staff on international duty strictly follow UEFA protocolsand are compliant with all Irish Government guidelines. The FAI reconfirms our support for all Government, UEFA and FIFA protocols during the COVID- pandemic. We thank all our stakeholders for their ongoing exemplary compliance with Government guidelines over the last  months.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.”     For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bank of Ireland branch at Strand Road is to close its doors today..Derry NewsA sad day - Bank of Ireland Strand Road branch in Derry to close their doors today for the last time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

This is not acceptable as it prevents new homes from being built in the area, Cllr Mason continued.ldquoThere are many developers looking to invest in both areas to build more affordable homes that locals can rent or buy and raise their families and expand the community as a whole. However, due to the current wastewater system and the failings of NI Water to upgrade it, developers have not been able to build homes.She said there was ldquono doubt that those living in rural areas experience greater dficulty in accessing affordable homes due to house and land prices, land availability and rates of development.She continued: ldquoFollowing the Covid- pandemic, which has resulted in a greater demand for social and affordable housing, it is vital that we see a fully transformative plan for all stakeholders mdash including the Housing Executive mdash to meet the needs of our rural communities.ldquoAfter the publication of the Housing Executiversquos annual housing investment plan for , it is evident that there is still a huge amount of work to do to deliver social and affordable homes across the district.Cllr Mason said she was confident that achieving an increase in the construction of new and affordable social housing will benefit from Communities Minister Deirdre Hargeyrsquos proposed reforms of the Housing Executive which will allow the organisation to borrow from the market to begin the construction of new social houses for the first time in years.ldquoThroughout the year, site identication studies were carried out by the Executive for Ardglass, Killough, Crossgar, Saintfield and a number of other areas throughout the district.

Further stages of the consultation process with EA are currently underway.ldquoThe school currently has  pupils with capacity in neighbouring catholic maintained schools to support the continued provision for the pupils should the Minister approve the closure.It says St Maryrsquos is operating with five year groups in a single composite class and a further year group in two other classrooms.Over the past five years, the schoolrsquos enrolment numbers have fluctuated between  and .The EA say these statistics show no indication that numbers will increase to  pupils required by Department of Education Sustainable Schools Policy for rural schools.However, while the schoolrsquos governors, staff and parents s were informed of the closure proposal last spring, a statement issued by the school yesterday indicated they opposed the closure.It read: ldquoGovernors and parents have a great confidence in the educational provision that St Maryrsquos provides for our children.ldquoOur most recent ETIreport found education at St Maryrsquos to be of a good standard and our pastoral care has always been outstanding.ldquoSt Maryrsquos is an innovative school with new sensory and nurture rooms. These additional resources enhance the excellent education provision on offer to pupils. ldquoThe school community takes great pride nurturing our pupilsrsquo talents and interests and we will continue to do so. ldquoGovernors and staff are of the view that our school is a vital part of the Saintfield community and we are continuing with efforts to see that it will remain so for future generations.The EA said in its report it investigated other options, such as becoming a shared or integrated education and amalgamation with other schools, but concluded that closure was recommended as there was no evidence ldquoany other option considered could provide sustainable provision.It added: ldquoCCMS recognises the commitment of the governors and staff but the current challenging circumstances do not provide for a sustainable school.ldquoIt is recognised that despite the schoolrsquos best efforts, it continues to face sustainability challenges.

However, before any decision is made about the way forward, the council is keen to hear what the business community has to say.It was revealed last week that there are  empty shop units across the town, with Cllr Curran expressing ldquoconcern at the high number, explaining that as part of the consultation, every business in the town is being asked for its view on what measures could be taken to support its continued regeneration and to attract new investment and shoppers.The global pandemic hit a number of local businesses hard and while there are some politicians in favour of appointing a town centre manager to work in Downpatrick, others believe that the county town should not be given preferential treatment.Cllr Curran said whatever plan is devised to boost the townrsquos economic fortunes, it must have the support of the business community.ldquoI am appealing to businesses when they get the consultation letter from the council to respond and make their voice count, he continued.ldquoThis is a vitally important exercise and it is crucial that we get it right. We currently have too many empty businesses and this is an issue that we need to address.

Other towns which have vibrant tradersrsquo bodies or town centre managers have previously done well and I want to see Downpatrick included on this list.As ambitious plans are being advanced for the regeneration of the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty adjacent buildings, Cllr Curran said the current consultation with traders could not be more timely.ldquoThere is a need to provide a direct link between the business community, statutory organisations, a raft of government departments, key funders and the local authority and someone to oversee future development proposals, he continued.Cllr Curran said the Irish Street regeneration scheme could create new jobs and act as a catalyst for additional investment, explaining that in the short term, any help which existing businesses can be provided with will be more than welcome.He has also welcomed a pound, revitalisation scheme Church Street and hoped that a planned review of traffic light timings in the town centre could go some way towards helping ease congestion at peak periods.He added: ldquoI believe that the economic revitalisation of Downpatrick depends on a key link between the business community, local authority and others.

Half-time: Dromara - Drumaness -.At the start of the second half Quinn Armstrong scored a deserved point before the brave Conall OrsquoHare in the Dromara goal pulled off a crucial interception to deny Drumaness a certain goal.Try as they would, Dromara could not curb their rampant opponents. Niall Flanagan added to his tally with a couple more points and Ben Cassidy struck a good score.Conor Armstrong added a free and minutes later Jake Madine wriggled his way through a number of defenders and smashed the ball to the net.Before the water break Joe McAllister and Conor Armstrong exchanged great long range points but the destiny of the Shield was now beyond doubt with Drumaness leading by  points.In the final quarter, Dromara half forwards Sean McEvoy and Rory Gilmore continued to work hard, as did front men James Gould, Eddie Maguire and Rhys Ewing but try as they did Dromara couldnrsquot break down the tight Drumaness rearguard.At the other end of the pitch no one could stop the outstanding Conor Armstrong. He sailed through the Dromara defence once again to net another fine goal and assisted in a further goal scored by Joe OrsquoHagan.It was fitting that Armstrong completed the Drumaness scoring by adding a further three points to his unbelievable tally before the final whistle sounded.Dromara played well in patches in this game and will rue some of the early chances they missed.They will look back on a great campaign this season with most of their team available next year.They also won the U- County Feile in the summer and the management team deserve great credit for everything this team has achieved.Drumaness were excellent throughout the match and their physicality and fast movement proved too much for this young Dromara side.Drumanessrsquos Conor Armstrong produced a man of the match performance that was absolutely exceptional and would grace any final. He had a personal tally of -, all of which were scores of the highest quality.Drumaness and Down have a real star of the future in their ranks.

I see the tourists who visit Hard Yard every day and they remind me just how special it is. I think all of the students here have a great awareness of the university and its history, the great people who have walked through these gates, but also our professors and how incredible there are. We realise that not only are we being taught by some of the greatest minds in their field but also in the world.He intends to share his excitement and his awe of the university with others.ldquoI was lucky enough to visit Hard four years ago and I was completely struck by the place, he said. ldquoI never thought I would get in and I want to give that experience for any prospective students coming to visit.ldquoWhen I see young people out with their families, I always offer to take photographs of them as I think itrsquos really important to show them thatI, a wee boy from Ireland, can get in, then so can they.As one of the , new intake students this year, the  year-old is indeed walking in the footsteps of impressive former students. Eight former American presidents studied there, including John F Kennedy, George W Bush and Barack Obama, along with leaders from all aspects of le, such as the politician and diplomat Henry Kissinger, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, the poet TS Elliot, actors such as Matt Damon and Tommy Lee Jones and a host of Nobel and Pulitzer prizewinners.He lives in a building on the corner of the iconic Hard Yard mdash the universityrsquos historic centre thoroughfare mdash where President Obamarsquos daughter, Malia, and actress Natalie Portman once stayed as undergraduates.Cormac brings a lot to the Hard table as well. Along with getting involved with youth politics and speaking at a debate in the House of Commons, he is a determined campaigner on social issues.In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic last year, Cormac helped to establish the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union of Northern Ireland , the first of its kind here, and was also central to getting former Education Minister Peter Weir to do a U-turn on A-Level grades after last yearrsquos controversial algorithm was used to determine grades in .He was made honorary president of the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union at the same time as studying for his A-Levels and also fulfilling duties as the Member of UK Youth Parliament for South Down.He explained: ldquoI had to submit to an entirely dferent application process to that of UCASand applied quite early, having to have it done by November  last year.ldquoI had to write two essays, one about being from Northern Ireland and how it impacted on my identity as a person, and the second was about me founding the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union and running our first campaign while working over the summer cleaning the toilets at Tyrella Beach.ldquoI also had to submit my academic record while writing ious mini essays and had weeks of essay writing and redrafting and redefining my work to ensure that I was putting my best foot forward.ldquoThe best thing about having to make the deadline in November was that I found out that I had an unconditional offer by mid-December so the pressure was totally off me when it came to waiting on results day in August. I was in a lucky position that I already had my flight booked for Boston  days after that.Believed to be the only lsquoRed Highrsquo student to have attended Hard, Cormac is the son of Gina and Stephen Savage.

There was a huge collective sigh of relief on Sunday in both Belfast and London as they finally got the chance to prove to the world that they were ready for the . mile challenge.In normal circumstances some have managed to do both London and Belfast in the same year as they are often back to back in April and May, but with both races scheduled for the same date that was not possible.The Belfast race started at Stormont Estate and finished at Ormeau Park with a route that took in many areas of the city, including a few unwelcome hills.The day dawned bright and fresh and at times there was heat in the sun. The odd light shower which cooled the runners was welcome at first but as the day went on it became a more persistent mizzle.The underlying issue was the stf breeze and whether it was a head or tail wind depending on the direction of travel. Undeterred the runners ran through whatever was thrown at them and most finished with a smile on their face.Gordy Graham does not shy away from laying his cards on the table.

Obviously with the pandemic that was not to be.He kept on training as consistently as ever and in May at the Championchip Marathon at Down Royal he managed to shave a few seconds off the London time ndash despite a lack of crowds and the fact that it was run on a lapped circuit.He had by then got over the disappointment of realising that due to an admin error his London entry was not carried over to this year.In true trooper form he decided that it would have to be Belfast for his attempt to better his time.He ran a very good half marathon in Larne in August , which was the confidence boost that he needed and when he lined up in Stormont on Sunday, he was full of intent.He managed to latch on to a group for the early part but as the runners stretched out he was forced to run many miles solo which is never ideal.He admits that he hit a low on the Boucher Road when his pacing was skewed by the wind and the gradient, but he rallied to run a strong second half.He was euphoric when he crossed the line in .. He had cut his previous best by four minutes and placed th overall.There is a strong possibility that this is the EDAC marathon record and research is underway to confirm. For those who like statistics, his average pace was five minutes  per mile.Many of us would struggle to run one mile at that speed let alone . of them. A fantastic performance which is so well deserved.Anyone who knows him, knows that he has an admirable work ethic fitting his heavy training regime round his work and his family.After the race, he paid tribute to his coach Ryan Maxwell for keeping him on target in the run up to the event. Some would say ldquohave a well earned rest, but that would be a waste of breath.ldquoEnjoy the buzz would be a more helpful comment followed by ldquoWhatrsquos next Behind Gordy, but also pleased with his performance, was Declan Teague. He was out to complete his th marathon only a couple of weeks after the Causeway Marathon.It was a last minute decision to run and as soon as he decided he would go for it, he was afflicted with a niggle in his hip and leg almost asit was warning him off.He typically chose to ignore the omen and was glad that he did so as number  is now in the bag.He scored another sub .and it keeps him ticking over until the next one. He hopes to take part in Kildare Marathon in a fortnight mdash there is no rest for this man.Clare Carson and Kevin Kelly had signed up for this race on the original date and clocked many miles in their convoluted preparation.Clare in particular has featured in the EDAC news for some of her crazy exploits involving ultra distances.

She was a great representative of the club and made full use of the opportunity.Phillip Vint has completed the London Marathon many times and yet he would still say that each time is special.This year it was all the more so with the enforced layoff from competition due to restrictions.

Super work, Hannah.Deo Kato works and lives in London so there was no way he was going to miss out.This was not his first marathon but it was his first in London and even though he sees the sights on a daily basis, he was blown away by the experience of running on the closed roads of the city and the support of the cheering crowds. He hopes that this will be something that he repeats next year.Wendy Findlay set off to the remote location of Loch Ness for her marathon. She loved the pipers and the Baxterrsquos soup at the finish but the monster hill at mile  wasnrsquot so welcome.She described the route as undulating but scenic and the weather, as you would expect in Autumn in the highlands, as fresh but damp.The marshals were friendly, reaching the start was easy and all in all she had a great day out.

It could normally cost them pound to hire a skip to dispose of them, said Francie, who estimates he has used  pallets so far.ldquoI once got  sheets of aluminium for pound mdash thatrsquos for nothing to what they would cost new. I like to use things that people might think of being rubbish, or having no other use, but thatrsquos not true at all.Francie is intending that  percent of his boat will be made from recycled materials as he has bought a re-serviced engine and other items for the interior.He has been working six hours a day since last April, making the boat in three separate sections mdash the hull, the mid section and the cabin mdash in his large workshop at home on the Ardglass Road before assembling them outside.ldquoI couldnrsquot wait to get up in the morning to work on it, it was so exciting and great to see the progress and it finally coming together, he said.He has devised an innovative way of creating ballast in the boat by drilling  holes in the hull to allow water in to sink the boat which is then offset by the air pressure inside creating air pockets for the right balance of ballast and float.ldquoItrsquos only an Irishman who would build a boat hull and then drill holes into it, but people will be interested in this method once the boat is on the water, said Francie.A retired woodcutting machinist, Francie can turn his hand to many a trade, and has done so over the years, even building the two-bedroom cottage for him and his we, Patricia.His attention to detail and planning was so thorough that he built a -inch scaled model of the boat in four weeks so that he could see exactly how his design would work in practiceWith the help of friends, he has been videoing his progress on the boat building in order to give other people a detailed instruction on how to do it for themselves.ldquoIrsquove designed the boat to a simple construction so thatanyone knows how to use a hammer and a saw, they will be able to make this as itrsquos all made with butt joints. Therersquos nothing complicated about it,said Francie.ldquoThe whole point of building the boat is show people that it can be done from recycled materials and even though something is made out of what some people might see as rubbish, it can still be done well.His river boat wonrsquot be made for speed, which suits him just fine.He got his first taste of river boating when he and his we hired a cruise boat on the Erne about  years ago.ldquoIt was absolutely beautul and I loved going along at about five miles an hour as you had time to see everything around you.ldquoIt was a bit of a shock than to get back in the car and go then even at mph. I really enjoyed the speed that the river boat goes at.Part of the joy and excitement for Francie working on the boat is knowing what enjoyment his large family of  grandchildren and two great-grandchildren and their parents will have over the years to come.ldquoThe boat should last about - years and we all hope to enjoy it. Itrsquos got to the stage where the family are asking lsquo our boat is readyrsquo yet, he added.Francie and Patricia moved to Downpatrick with four of their children in the early s due to the Troubles in Belfast.He is planning to name the boat The Hockaninny after spending some time on a school trip to Nissan huts in the Dundrum area.ldquoThere must have been about  of us kids staying in these huts in a field at the time, explained Francie.ldquoThere was nothing for us to do other than play on a discarded bunk bed which had only three legs. It became our bus, our boat, our train, anything we could think of to play on and one day one lad named it The Hockaninny.ldquoSo there was this piece of rubbish that gave us endless pleasure and entertainment and I hope the boat will also do it over the years to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_francie(1).jpg","title":"Francie comes good  ","story":"SATURDAY saw the climax of Ardglass Golf Clubrsquos th anniversary celebrations, with an open stableford competition sponsored by the AJC Group.The company, which specialises in festive lighting, electrical and event services and retail, has been sponsoring the Ardglass club generously for a number of years and one of the talking points of the day was a magnicent pound, cash prize on offer for a hole-in-one at the par three th.A torrential early morning downpour soaked many of the early starters, but although a strong wind continued to blow, conditions were warm and sunny for the rest of the day for most of the  players.One of the grouprsquos managing directors, Declan Murdock, was on hand to see players set off from early light and was again present that evening to see first prize handed to the eventual winner, who turned out to be none other than his father, Francie.Playing off a five-handicap, Francie was round in a one over par , with three birdies on his card, including one at the th which saw him finish on  points.The runner-up was Conaill Taggart, who was the leader in the clubhouse for about an hour on  points and whose strong back nine included a birdie at the th.In next place was Jack David, in his first competition of the year.

interest them in investing in a major redevelopment of the entire seafront of the town, from the Slieve Donard to Newcastle harbour.A new brochure detailing the councilrsquos plans for the town has been produced and is being circulated to a large number of firms, other funding sources and statutory agencies.Blueprints for the improvement scheme, which has received support from both the council and the Newcastle  group, were revealed last year.The plan consists of three stages mdash from the Downs Road car park to Castle Bridge, between the Newcastle Centre and Pattons Bridge and the third section which involves creating a new promenade to the harbour.The document outlines plans to regenerate Newcastle and make it a top tourist destination.DOWNPATRICK mdash The development of a new multi-screen cinema in Downpatrick would provide the perfect kick-start to a major economic regeneration initiative in the town, it has been claimed.Downpatrick councillor, Peter Craig, who has been one of the driving forces behind the push for a new cinema made his comments three weeks after plans to develop a new cinema at Dunleath Park were abandoned by Down Council.The local authority admitted the ambitious proposal earmarked for land adjacent to the Down Leisure Centre had fallen victim to legal and financial problems.However, it hopes the multi-million pound complex can be developed at an alternative site where in the town centre and be up and running within the next few years.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Firefighters tackled a blaze at a farmyard on the outskirts of Castlewellan last week.The blaze, at Wood Road, was discovered at around .am last Friday when a passing postman alerted the farmer that one of his barns was on fire.Two crews of firemen from Newcastle and a third from Rathfriland were called to the scene and fought the fire in the barn, which contained  round bales of straw.A second adjoining shed, which had  tonnes of silage stored in it, also went on fire and although the first barn was destroyed, the structure of the second was saved.Station officer Nevin Donaghy explained that although no animals or humans were hurt, their efforts at fighting the fire were hampered as the nearest hydrant was over one mile away from the farmyard.CROSSGAR mdash No toys, few clothes and little food ndash local schoolchildren yesterday discovered first hand what

themselves just how dficult le is for people across the world.DRUMANESS mdash Local politicians have this week been accused of portraying a negative image of the district and hampering future inward investment.The damning claim has been made by Rowallane councillor Eddie Rea, who secured a seat on the local authority just over three months ago.Mr Rea believes recent comments by some politicians about the plan to extend the Thales Air Defence base near Drumaness, which employs  people, sends out the message that investors are not welcome in Down District.And he is also concerned about comments by ious politicians about the proposals by mobile telephone companies to extend their ious networks across the district.Although the defence companyrsquos headquarters are in Belfast, the Loughmann base is used as a final assembly plant for its products and Mr Rea said the recent comments about the facility by SDLP councillors Patsy Toman and Margaret Ritchie ldquoportray a negative

the ldquoreal facts of the case.KILLYLEAGH mdash A poundm plan to build over  new homes in Killyleagh has received a major boost from local people.Local planners were last week presented with a

open food hall in Downpatrick as we reported in 2017  ","story":"NEWS that Marks and Spencer has identied Downpatrick as a potential base for a new food store comes over four years after the Down Recorder first broke the story.In March , the paper revealed that MS could be the latest big name arrival in the town and that the High Street retailer had examined a number of potential sites.These included the former Danske bank premises in Market Street, but MS subsequently turned its attention to the former Irish Street police station which is to be redeveloped as part of a major town centre regeneration initiative.In a document published by CBRE, MS has confirmed that it is now seeking out-of-town or edge of town sites to set up food stores of at least , sq ft.Downpatrick is one of seven towns where the leading retailer would like to open new stores, with the others including Antrim, Armagh, Dungannon, Magherafelt, Newtownards and Carrickfergus.The towns are among a long list of areas across the UK where MS believes there is a market for its hugely popular food offering.The company said that it wants ldquoprominent sites on major roads with dedicated parking, adding that it will also consider moving into existing retail units.Currently, the nearest Marks and Spencer stores are at the Sprucefield retail park outside Lisburn and the Forestside complex in south Belfast, with the companyrsquos arrival in Downpatrick viewed as a major vote of confidence in the town.Local politicians say they are pleased that MS has not only retained its interest in Downpatrick, but recognises that locating one of its food stores in the town would be a very successful move.South Down MLA Colin McGrath, Baroness Margaret Ritchie and Downpatrick area councillors Dermot Curran and Gareth Sharvin hope that MSrsquos plans will come to fruition.ldquoThis type of food outlet has a following which would undoubtedly see people travelling to Downpatrick that previously would not have and that extra footfall can help other businesses in the town, he said.ldquoI believe this is a good new story and an indication that Downpatrick is being noticed by retailers as a place to do business and that is also good sign for local people.Mr McGrath is encouraging MS to aim for a location that is as close to the town centre as possible, suggesting the last thing local businesses need is displacement of footfall, confirming that he plans to raise this issue with store executives.Lady Ritchie said that as part of the townrsquos ongoing economic regeneration ldquowhich needs to be driven by a town centre manager, she is pleased that Marks and Spencer has identied seven sites in Northern Ireland for new food stores. ldquoOne of those sites is Downpatrick where the possible location of a food store has been talked about for several years, she continued.ldquoI hope that such a new store comes to fruition and that MS receive every assistance from Newry, Mourne and Down Council in identying the best optimum site which will offer local people a wider food choice as well as helping to pump-prime economic and business regeneration in Downpatrick.Cllr Curran mdash who is seeking a meeting with MS officials mdash said the fact that the retail giantrsquos interest in Downpatrick appeared to be as strong as it was four years ago was good news.He continued: ldquoClearly, MS has done its homework and sees major potential in opening a food store in the town which would signicantly increase footfall and help provide a boost for existing businesses.ldquoA new food store would also create much-needed jobs and hopefully open the door to other big names to take their place alongside the independent and family-owned businesses that we currently have.He added: ldquoFacing into a post-Covid world, the arrival of a major retailer in Downpatrick would provide everyone with a lt. More and more big names in the retail world investing in the town would illustrates their confidence in it and will help kick-start its future growth.Cllr Sharvin, who announced the retail giantrsquos interest in the town last year when he was discussing the area with MS management and letting agents, is urging local council officials to work with the company.ldquoMS has been looking to find an ideal location within the Downpatrick area for some time and needs to be at least , square feet with a good volume of parking outside. This is a great opportunity to boost the local economy within Downpatrick and bring a large number of jobs to the area that are much-needed, he said.Cllr Sharvin has asked the councilrsquos economic, regeneration and tourism department work with MS and its agents in identying a site that will meet the needs of the organisation and has also urge any commercial owners or developers to come forward to work with the organisation to start the process.He added: ldquoThis is too big an opportunity to miss for our town and we must all work together to deliver this..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_michaela.jpg","title":"Michaela recognised for community work  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK woman who kept residents in the Ballymote area connected during the pandemic has had her efforts recognised by the Housing Executive.Michaela Hannaway was thanked by housing officials as part of their Good Neighbours Make Great Neighbourhoods campaign.During the summer, Housing Executive staff and members of its Housing Community Network nominated tenants who have made a dference in communities all over Northern Ireland.

The versatile Orla Fegan demonstrated excellent support play throughout, escaping the close marking Anne Marie Fegan.Former Drumaness player Julie Brown played strongly at full back, but the excellent pressure from Carville, Gordon and Fitzimons ensured that Dromararsquos play never found the same rhythm that it did in previous league meetings.Jade Casement was colossal at the back, time and again making crucial interceptions, before off loading to Ferris and Noade.Aisling McClements, Edel Kearney, Laura and Kerri Madine all competed well when introduced, but it was stalwart Sharon Taylorrsquos sublime finish to the top corner of the net that drew the loudest applause.Fittingly, it was Gordon who created the opportunity for Taylor, who displayed her reservoirs of experience to cooly slot home from a narrow angle.The embrace from her team mates afterwards demonstrated the growing camaraderie and togetherness amongst the group.The importance of Taylor and Gordonrsquos contribution cannot be understated, providing priceless experience and ensuring that the strong tradition and legacy that Annie Gelston created continues.Other players are rumoured to be potentially coming out of retirement next season, including Annette Gelston.A fine win to build upon and now St Kevinrsquos have a tough fixture against a resolute Kilclief Ben Derg side at Fontenoy Park, Liatroim tomorrow evening at .pm.Former Fontenoy, and current St Kevinrsquos leader Maria Ryan certainly knows Fontenoy Park well and she will be hoping that she can replicate the incredible personal tally of - she scored in this fixture.St Kevinrsquos -Dromara -JUNIOR CAMOGIE CrsquoSHIP.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13079759.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is also likely to call for measures to reduce livestock transportation and for changes in land management, which may impact on the use of slurry.Some farmers, in , believe that not enough attention is given to the ability of their grassland to absorb carbon emissions.Edwin PootsNorthern IrelandClare Bailey  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularPM Boris Johnson leads tributes to former NI Secretary James Brokenshire following his deathPSNI officer investigated for  years ... on word of Mount Vernon UVF killer Gary Haggarty‘Unionism is led by gutless careerist amateurs: time for a clear out’Judith Gillespie says sexual assaults by male officers ‘not uncommon when I joined up’ in wake of Sarah Everard murder by Wayne CouzensTim McGarry: The ‘Brexiteers against Brexit’ lot are angry – here are my proposalsMost Popular‘A message to the IRA man who killed my brother: you have wasted your le’‘Boris has basically admitted it: the Scotland   Northern Ireland bridge is dead’‘PSNI need to keep giving no-MOT drivers leeway until test logjam clears’ says DUP Policing Board member Maurice BradleyIrish pupil numbers being in freefall is a sign a language act is not neededIrish Government will be represented at NI centenary church service                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They seem to have abandoned principles that were once the bedrock of the party, and have no conscience about it.More worrying, their members have bought into it.They are courting popularity, and in a world that has become increasingly secular this will earn its nod of approval, but that comes at a price!If you sell your soul, the devil always collects.Public opinion can be fickle!No doubt in the run up to the election they will resort to the old vote catcher: “vote to keep the other side out”.

There can also be pus and some may have the condition for weeks or even months.What are chilblains and how does this dfer from Covid toes Chilblains are small, itchy, red patches that can appear after you have been in the cold.Chilblains usually appear a few hours after you have been in the cold and you mostly get them on your fingers and toes, but can also get them on your face and legs.They usually clear up on their own in two to three weeks, but you may need to see a GPthey do not go away.What causes Covid toes A new study - published in the British Journal of Dermatology - has found that Covid toes could be a side effect of the immune systemrsquos response to coronavirusResearchers behind the study examined  participants with Covid toes and  with similar chilblains lesions that arose before the pandemic.The study found that one mechanism behind both types of the condition involved the body generating an immune response with high levels of certain autoantibodies, which mistakenly target and react with a personrsquos own cells and tissues as well as the invading virus.     Researchers also found an overlap with type I interferon, which is a key protein in the antiviral response.Cells lining blood vessels which supply the affected areas also appeared to play a critical role in the development of Covid toes and chilblains.Senior author of the study, Dr Charles Cassius, said the research provided a deeper understanding of the condition.He said: ldquoThe epidemiology and clinical features of chilblain-like lesions have been extensively studied and published, however, little is known about the pathophysiology involved.ldquoOur study provides new insights. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Councillor Sam Nicholson.Businesses providing separatetoilets for male, female, disabled and baby changing receivea higher fee than those offering just one unisex toilet.The matter was originally tentativelydiscussed by the environmental services committee in November and December  before ing to the agenda in August  with an updated report on the matter presented to members of the committee on Tuesday, October .The community toilet scheme was initially considered as a way to deal with any potential shortfall in public toilet facilities in Portadown, however, the report notes the toilet facilities in Portadown ’s building on William Street are now operational and are under contract until April .With regards to a pilot for the scheme, the report suggests Lurgan and Portadown as two suitable areas.At present,Lurgan has four free to use facilities along with  pubs and caféswhile Portadown has eight free to use facilities along with  pubs and cafés.Members were also made aware that Derry City and Strabane Council launched its own Community Toilet Scheme in April  and have  participating businesses.Councillor Sam Nicholson asked businesses had previously expressed interest in the scheme but was advised businesses had never really been approached about the scheme by Council’s head of environmental services, Barry Patience.“It had been brought to committee on a number of occasions to seewe wanted to go to businesses,” said Mr Patience.“The only thing we have done is identy those locations so there is some detail for Portadown and Lurgan as possible sites for a trial.“We have not approached businesses yet. “Members had previously said they would be happy to hear more information about the scheme so this is us bringing that further information back.”Councillor Nicholson said it would be worth “asking the question” to businesses and proposed a workshop to discuss the potential objectives, scope and outcomes of any potential scheme.His proposal was seconded by Alderman Stephen Moutray who said it would be worth “exploring the merit” of this proposal.“This is potentially an opportunity to provide more facilities for people in our town centreswe go ahead with this,” he said.“As long as we are sure this has not already been discussed with businesses then I am happy to second the proposal that this is explored further in a workshop.”Read this:- Halloween back with a bangEditor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation. Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
