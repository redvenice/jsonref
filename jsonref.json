Photograph: Nick BradshawThe The IDA should change its successful strategy in attracting foreign investment to highlight how Ireland is embracing climate actions, and providing opportunities for those wishing to decarbonise, an EPA conference has been told.That was the verdict of the climate advocate, Dr Edward Cameron, a Dubliner based in the US who has advised governments on how best to respond to climate disruption – and previously worked for the World Resource Institute. The IDA approach was one of the greatest success stories of his lifetime, he said at the conference, the theme of which was Ireland becoming a climate leader. The compelling mix – a young, capable English-speaking workforce low corporation tax and access to the EU single market – had worked. The tagline in attracting international investment would, however, have to change form “at the heart of Europe” to “at the heart the new climate economy” if that success was to continue backed by being a genuine green economy, he said.In addition, public procurement would need to change from taking the lowest cost option, to accepting the lowest carbon option, Mr Cameron said. Planning and zoning issues had to be addressed as the decision by Apple to move investment from Athenry to Copenhagen indicated companies who cannot access renewable energy from the grid or cannot build their own on-site renewable power source “will pick up and go elsewhere”. Globally, the focus needed to shift beyond talk of “climate apocalypse” though there was only limited time to address the issue. It was all solvable with technological and financial innovations. “The real tragedy of climate change is that it undermines human rights people’s right to food, health and life – and that it disproportionately affects the marginalised and the vulnerable,” he added.Climate economyOthers were seizing opportunities in “the new climate economy”. China, he noted, had committed to have 20 per cent of its energy needs from renewables by 2020, equivalent to all the energy consumed in the US over a five-year period. This was part of move that would see it become “the clean energy superpower of the 21st century”.Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton said the declaration of a national climate emergency by unanimous Dáil vote was more than symbolic, and signalled politicians wanted to take a leadership role.The vote was “not giving an inidual super powers in war time” but it was recognition Ireland was 95 per cent off target on its commitments, which was not acceptable for a wealthy country. He said there was a risk of isions opening up during move to a decarbonised Ireland. Sectors should not be set against one another, while fairness was essential for a just transition. In that difficult mix would be climate deniers “many purveyors of magic bullets that simply don’t work”, and those who say “let big oil pay” when people needed to be weaned off fossils fuels or “let China or India pay” – a view he heard expressed in surprising quarters.Mr Bruton confirmed Ireland would only reduce its emissions by 1 per cent in 2020, when it had promised to achieve a 20 per cent reduction. This would result in having to buy compliance of up to €150 million in 2020 – “buying out our failure” – with a risk those fines could escalate dramatically in following years.The Minister for Finance would shortly begin consultation on increasing carbon tax in the 2020 Budget and on how those revenues should be used. The tax was likely to ultimately reach €265 per tonne of CO2 by 2050, Mr Bruton added, which would concentrate minds in switching away from fossil fuels.The Government’s climate plan due to be published shortly would include sectoral targets and set out pathways to reduce Ireland carbon footprint in the least burdensome and least costly way. It would be driven by the Department of the Taoiseach and be subject to yearly reviews, he confirmed."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3893303.1557933565!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"over 150 medical devices in ireland recalled annually","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBall and socket elements of a contentious replacement hip device. Photograph: Bryan O’BrienThe More than 150 medical devices are recalled from the Irish market annually over safety concerns, according to figures released by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA).The latest figures show that the authority issues hundreds of field-safety corrective action notices each year in relation to medical devices.These notices concern actions aimed at reducing “a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of a medical device”. These alerts and can be about a device or a particular lot or batch of the product.Data journalists working with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) had “scraped” 4,789 safety notices and other warnings from the HPRA’s website and uploaded them to a database being built as part of its work on the sector.While the Irish records have always been publicly available, the consortium of investigative journalists’ website is being designed to enable easier searching and to allow for comparisons with other jurisdictions. The journalists working on the project said the Irish regulator’s website is one of the most difficult to search that it has come across.The Irish files are among 16,691 records from Hong Kong, the Czech Republic, Italy, Belgium, New Zealand, Denmark and El Salvador that are being added as part of the latest large upload to the ICIJ database.The International Medical Devices Databasewas first published in November as part of ICIJ’s Implant Files investigation. The  was one of the media organisations involved in the project.In 2017, there were 519 field safety corrective actions notified to the Health Products Regulatory Authority by manufacturers, of which 178 involved the removal of a product, or batches of the product, from the market. In 2016 the comparable figures were 476 and 147, while in 2015 they were 474 and 160.Over the same period the authority also issued Dear Health Care Professional letters, which are sent directly to a patient’s doctor when a problem with a medical device involves a small number of people. The regulatory authority issued 12 such letters in 2015, with 35 and 23 being issued respectively over the subsequent two years.The authority conducts a risk assessment of all the field-safety correction notices it receives, which it then uses to guide it as to how it should respond. As part of its response, the regulatory authority sometimes issues a safety notice about a particular device. It releases 35 to 45 such notices each year.Staplers used in surgeryOn April 11th, it issued a safety notice in relation to staplers used in surgery which had a defect that could trigger serious post-operative complications including haemorrhage or haemorrhagic shock.The manufacturers of the product, Ethicon Endo-Surgery LLC, told the authority that 422 of the affected units of the product had been placed on the Irish market, but that there had been no complaints reported to date from Ireland.The high-priority notice was issued to hospital managers, colorectal surgeons, intensive care staff, procurement managers and others.Ireland plays an important role in the global medical device sector, with many of the leading multinationals having substantial operations here. The ICIJ database allows for searchs about a particular product in any of the jurisdictions from which data has been uploaded. It also allows for searches about particular manufacturers.The EU’s regulatory regime for medical devices is being reformed, with measures to be introduced over the coming years to involve improved oversight and increased transparency. The previous regime was considered by many to be inadequate. Safety noticeThe HPRA issued a safety notice last November about a range of catheters and drainage and feeding tubes to intensive care units, hospitals, nursing homes and hospices.The product, which is manufactured by an English company called ConvaTec Ltd, was first withdrawn in July because of concerns that it might not be sterile and could lead to patients developing an infection.Notices such as these are being posted on the HPRA website on a regular basis. And its not just mistakes made in manufacturing plants that can create dangers.Earlier this year hospitals were warned about a counterfeit Chinese medical device being marketed for use on patients with asthma, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disese, and other respiratory conditions.The fake nebuliser masks - devices used to administer medications by way of a mist - copied a product produced by Hangzhou Medtec Devices Co Ltd, of China.A spokeswoman for the HPRA said the company had informed it that it never sold its product in the Irish market. She also said there was no evidence that the counterfeit product was ever sold here. One of the most striking aspects of cases where medical devices go wrong is when it involves an implanted device.In October 2016 the HPRA issued a safety notice about an implantable cardioverter defibrillator made by St Jude Medical, because of problems with the batteries. At the time 349,852 of the implantable devices were “in service worldwide”, the company said.A special investigation by The  in association with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Climate advocate says procurement must favour lowest carbon not lowest cost optionSister of 16-year-old solider tells Trinity audience how her brother never fully recoveredPublic meetings being held across Ireland to communicate State\u0026rsquos 2020 diaspora policyInvestigations are underway into the death of the 51-year-old agricultural contractorTD recounts \u0026lsquohard fought\u0026rsquo efforts for inquests that revealed death by medical misadventureMinister insists no recruitment embargo in place in health serviceTaoiseach appeals to Opposition to have open mind about \u0026euro5bn broadband dealDetails of work and social life from social media being used to create credibilityPrototype developed at Trinity College Dublin \u0026lsquoreminds me what meds to take\u0026rsquo, says userTaobh Coille in Cahirciveen saw off competition from nine other B\u0026ampB Ireland finalists\u0026lsquoNo British soldier should be above the law\u0026rsquo, says Sinn F\u0026eacutein Assembly memberOfficial says LGBT+ iniduals face issues due disputes at home over their sexual orientationParty tells political heavyweight M\u0026aacuteiread McGuinness to give counties to running mateKathleen Kiely (31) was stopped by garda\u0026iacute who had placed Gold Digger jewellery shop under surveillanceOfficer took statement from woman \u0026lsquobut did nothing further\u0026rsquo with it, according to reportFreedom of expression \u0026lsquodoes not include freedom to broadcast mass murder\u0026rsquoMary Burke fractured her ankle after buying a parking ticket in Thurles in February 2016Two weeks before elections 50 visitors enjoy \u0026lsquoan evening of refreshments, food and music\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3893263.1557930175!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"garda%C3%AD alert firms to sharp rise in use of bogus invoicing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTop gardaí say the problem is worsening, with €2.7m stolen in April alone. File photograph: Getty There has been a dramatic increase in cash being stolen from people and businesses by criminals using sham invoices in recent months, with €4.4 million stolen since the start of the year, the Garda has warned. Senior Garda officers say the problem is worsening, with €2.7 million stolen in April alone and 132 invoice redirection frauds reported to the Garda since the start of the year. Some of the recent thefts targeting Irish businesses and iniduals have been valued at almost €1 million. “If this continues the way it is, people will lose jobs or companies will not be able to continue trading,” said Chief Supt Pat Lordan of the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau. And he also warned of so-called chief executive fraud, where the identities of company chief executives are cloned online and a person posing as the chief executive seeks a bank deposit or even their own salary payments be made to a new bank account. Gardaí said senior executives are being watched on social media by gang members and when they are on holidays, for example, people posing as them online send emails to their businesses requesting the payment of a sum of money into the chief executive’s bank account. How is fraud perpetrated?While chief executive fraud is being reported to gardaí, invoice-redirect fraud is much more common and gardaí are concerned about it. The deceptions involve criminals posing as a commercial entity that normally has dealings with the company they intend to target. They send emails claiming their account details have been changed, often using sophisticated mock email addresses and logos from the entity they are impersonating. The criminals create online identities resembling companies or commercial entities that transact with target firms. In one case they sent emails to companies informing them that they had changed their banking details. They advised that any monies owed in the future should be paid into this new bank account, the details of which were supplied. When invoices were later sent for payment, the targeted companies lodged the money into the fraudsters’ account. Typically, once the payments are lodged they are transferred to other accounts outside the jurisdiction. This is done before the commercial entity targeted realises the invoice it believed paid has not been settled and the funds have instead been transferred to other accounts, run by the fraudsters.

Photograph: Google Street ViewThe Lord Mayor of Dublin invited customers of four pubs from his electoral ward into the Mansion House two weeks before the local elections for “an evening of entertainment, refreshments, food and music”.Nial Ring – who has already twice exhausted the free allowance of beer allocated to the Mansion House occupant – extended the invitation to the “patrons of The Bridge Tavern” in Summerhill, in Dublin’s north inner city, among other pubs.“This was an evening for the patrons of The Bridge Tavern, a pub I have drank in for 40 years,” said Mr Ring.The evening took place last Wednesday, May 8th, just over two weeks out from polling day in the local and European elections on May 24th.Mr Ring has been Lord Mayor since June 2018 and is a councillor for the north inner city. Diageo provides 120 kegs of beer, about 10,560 pints, to the lord mayor’s office free of charge each year as part of a long-standing tradition. It is served to guests at events and receptions hosted at the Dublin city centre venue.Mr Ring surpassed this free allowance in January and Diageo agreed to supply an extra 30 free kegs, although this also ran out in March. Dublin City Council then bought 71 kegs of beer for €15,280 after the second allocation ran dry.Mr Ring has previously said he would be “horrified at any suggestion that I was using the bar in the Mansion House to buy votes”. He has previously defended his use of entertainment funds.‘They are Dubliners’In response to queries on the event for customers of The Bridge Tavern, Mr Ring replied “they are Dubliners who I wished to invite to visit the Mansion House for an evening. A priority of my term as Lord Mayor was to open the Mansion House to the citizens of Dublin and ensure as many as wished, had the opportunity to visit the official residence of the first citizen of Dublin 50 people attended. This was not a private party but an invitation to a group of Dubliners to visit the Mansion House, similar to other invites extended to other citizens of Dublin.”Dublin City Council added: “Patrons of four pubs were invited to the Mansion House on the 8th May – a total of 50 visitors in total. The other three pubs were the Annesley House, Cusacks and Mullets.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3893270.1557930744!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"man with dyspraxia unfairly dismissed after google search about disorder","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA decision by a company to discrimatorily dismiss a man with dyspraxia was informed by a health and safety officer carrying out a Google search on the disorder, the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) has heard. File photograph: Alan BetsonThe .A decision by a company to dismiss a man with dyspraxia was informed by a health and safety officer carrying out a Google search on the disorder, the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) has heard. The commission ordered Sky Handling Partner Ltd, which is based at Dublin airport, to pay €15,000 in compensation to Stephen Dunne over his discriminatory dismissal from his role as an aircraft service agent in April of last year.The decision followed a report by the company’s health and safety officer, referred to as Mr B, which concluded that Mr Dunne was “not suitable for a position within the ramp department” at the airport. He was dismissed without formal explanation only a month into his employment. “Dublin Airport can be a hazardous environment due to the large amount of aircraft traffic every day…As Stephen is suffering from dyspraxia, this may place him more at risk by working in an already hazardous environment. Spatial awareness is a vital key within this role and everybody within the airport always needs to be aware of what is happening around them,” he said.Dyspraxia is a common disorder affecting fine andor gross motor coordination and iniduals vary in how its impacts on them.Mr Dunne took a case over his dismissal with the assistance of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and told the hearing that he holds a full driver licence and drives all the time without issue.‘Assumptions’WRC adjudication officer Valerie Murtagh said the report carried out by Mr B was “grounded on assumptions and generalisations about persons with dyspraxia but is not grounded on actual facts about the complainant’s specific condition”. Mr B told Ms Ms Murtagh at the hearing that his research on the disorder involved doing a ‘Google’ search on his computer.“It is quite astonishing, in my opinion, that Mr B compiled a report on the complainant without ever having met him or obtaining expert independent advice on the specifics of the complainant’s condition,” Ms Murtagh said. She found that Sky Handling Partner had failed to provide Mr Dunne with reasonable accommodation related to his disability and that he was discriminatorily dismissed on the grounds of his disability.Mr Dunne had contended that Mr B’s report was based entirely on speculation not grounded on facts about persons with dyspraxia and in particular on any actual facts about him.Sky Handling Partner told the WRC that Mr Dunne did not complete the required training for the position and therefore could not conduct the role for which he was employed.Along with ordering Sky Handling Partner pay Mr Dunne €15,000, Ms Murtagh ruled that the firm must conduct a review of its employment policies and practices to ensure compliance with the Employment Equality Acts."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3885416.1557342181!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"deal giving reciprocal rights for british irish citizens is signed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan, Tánaiste Simon Coveney, Britain’s minister for the cabinet office David Lidington, and  secretary of state for Northern Ireland Karen Bradley during a press conference in London at the signing of the Common Travel Area deal. Photograph: ReutersHenry NichollsThe British and Irish governments have signed an agreement that formally outlines the provisions of the Common Travel Area (CTA) for the first time and guarantees the reciprocal rights it confers regardless of Brexit. Tánaiste Simon Coveney and cabinet office minister David Lidington, Theresa May’s de facto deputy, signed the agreement in London on Wednesday afternoon, ahead of a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Council (BIIGC).“Our message to Irish citizens in the UK is that your rights will not change. You will still be able to move freely between Ireland, the UK and the islands.“You will still be able to work, study, draw your pension and access social security and public services in the UK. Above all, you will be welcome. And we welcome the similar commitment the Government of Ireland makes to British citizens in Ireland,” Mr Lidington said.Mr Coveney said the agreement should reassure British citizens in Ireland and Irish citizens in Britain that, regardless of whether Britain leaves with or without a deal, their rights and privileges would be protected. “This Memorandum of Understanding is comprehensive but it’s also flexible enough to be able to be updated and changed in the future if necessary and will be backed up with legislation in the necessary areas,” he said. Mr Lidington and Mr Coveney were joined by Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan and Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley for the two-hour BIIGC meeting. Established under the 1998 Belfast Agreement, the BIIGC did not meet from 2007 until last July but met again last November.Wednesday’s meeting focused on the future of the east-west relationship, economic cooperation, security issues in Northern Ireland and legacy issues as well as the Stormont talks.“The theme running through this is how we can strengthen our bilateral cooperation on everything from economic regeneration to security and justice. We obviously very much welcomed the resumption this week of talks aimed at restoring the Executive at Stormont,” Mr Lidington said. The memorandum of understanding sets out an agreed policy framework for the CTA, which not only guarantees free movement of people between Britain and Ireland but covers access to social security, health and education. The two governments have agreed to maintain existing arrangements on social insurance, child benefit and pensions. They have also agreed to work on new arrangements to ensure that British and Irish citizens will continue to have equal access to public health and education services in both countries.Newcastle University’s Colin Murray, a legal academic in the research project NI Constitution who campaigned for the CTA to be codified, said the agreement had been largely settled for months. “It is being concluded now because there is a period of relatively low tension in the Brexit negotiations, because the Irish and UK governments being seen to work together supports the drive towards a deal on restoring power-sharing institutions within Northern Ireland, and because, from the Irish Government’s perspective, Theresa May might not be long in office, and the CTA therefore needs to be locked down,” he told The .Business groups welcomed the agreement and John McGrane, director general of the British-Irish Chamber, said the free movement of people between Britain and Ireland brought tangible economic benefits.“The CTA helps support the €70 billion annual trade between our countries. It has resulted in there being more Irish Directors of UK companies than any other foreign nationality and it has contributed to Irish companies being the fifth largest foreign owners of UK firms,” he said.“Today’s agreement will go some way to protecting these achievements. However, the British Irish Chamber of Commerce remains clear in its view that the best way of protecting the economic and social links between these islands is through an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU followed by an unprecedented close future relationship. We encourage public representatives on all sides to work together to make this happen.”"},{"url":null,"title":"local","story":"Two weeks before elections 50 visitors enjoy \u0026lsquoan evening of refreshments, food and music\u0026rsquoTotal of 150 candidates running in 63-seat constituencyTotal of 85 candidates running in 37-seat constituencyTotal of 107 candidates running in 55-seat constituencyTotal of 62 candidates running in 32-seat constituencyTotal of 66 candidates running in 34-seat constituencyTotal of 49 candidates running in 20-seat constituencyTotal of 66 candidates running in 32-seat constituencyTotal of 79 candidates running in 40-seat constituencyTotal of 92 candidates running in 40-seat constituencyTotal of 35 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyTotal of 33 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyTotal of 36 candidates running in 19-seat constituencyTotal of 33 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyTotal of 78 candidates running in 40-seat constituencyTotal of 63 candidates running in 30-seat constituencyTotal of 60 candidates running in 29-seat constituencyTotal of 39 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyTotal of 92 candidates running in 40-seat constituencyTotal of 32 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyTotal of 39 candidates running in 19-seat constituencyTotal of 44 candidates running in 24-seat constituencyTotal of 90 candidates running in 40-seat constituencyTotal of 62 candidates running in 33-seat constituencyTotal of 78 candidates running in 39-seat constituencyTotal of 47 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyTotal of 89 candidates running in 40-seat constituencyTotal of 82 candidates running in 31-seat constituencyTotal of 51 candidates running in 28-seat constituencyTotal of 33 candidates running in 18-seat constituency31 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyBreakdown of latest  poll numbers indicates growing support for both parties in DublinMore than 500 female candidates are contesting the local elections, many of them under 35Gap in backing for Fine Gael and Fianna F\u0026aacuteil smallest in 2\u0026frac12 years while Sinn F\u0026eacutein also slipsBad news for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar whose personal satisfaction rating continues to fallVoters who care about the right to life must send a message to smug pro-choice partiesCourt records show Nial Ring has been defendant in 16 sets of High Court proceedings since 2004Almost 2,000 candidates will contest 949 seats in 31 city and county councilsCandidate \u0026lsquoconfused\u0026rsquo by party statement after campaigning throughout review processA significant portion of the electorate is making a plea for a move from polarised to a more accommodating form of politicsGreens and People Before Profit also make gains in local electionsKisyombe\u0026rsquos candidacy sparked controversy following backstory inconsistenciesConservatives lose more than 1,100 seats in local elections as Labour loses more than 100 seatsDUP\u0026rsquos first openly gay candidate elected to Newtownabbey Borough CouncilIrreverent campaign asked people to vote all the way down the ballot in PR-STV electionTalks designed to restore devolution set to begin next Tuesday after Thursday\u0026rsquos pollAlison Bennington is party candidate for the Glengormley urban area of Newtownabbey Borough CouncilParty has launched 111 candidates for the local elections, and three candidates for the European electionsExtended licensing hours for serving alcohol also considered as part of local election planVoters outside the capital must use manual processPosters are an important part of our electoral and democratic process, says KinsellaPoliticians risk \u0026euro150 fine per early election posterThe upcoming local and European elections are powerful platforms for the marginalised to make their voices heardCommittee says message to local and European candidates had been \u0026lsquomisunderstood\u0026rsquoBusConnects reforms would create 230km of bus lanes along 16 traffic corridorsWe need to establish why more immigrants don\u0026rsquot participate in politics, says one candidateCouncillor-migrant internship scheme seeks to encourage greater migrant involvementInstagram helps politicians present a more rounded image.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Some people, like the leader of the Green Party, might be hung up on one particular fix when it comes to sorting out the broadband problem or alleviating the housing crisis.The Government, on the other hand, prides itself on taking a much broader view. As the Taoiseach pointed out during Leaders Questions, it likes to take a good run at things from every direction. A kind of scattergun approach, although Fine Gael’s policy pellets are suspiciously prone to peppering the habitat favoured by the hungry beasts of private enterprise.“We take a rational, rather than an ideological view on this” Leo Varadkar patiently explained to Eamon Ryan, who had been giving his thoughts on how our ongoing housing difficulties could be better addressed by the Taoiseach’s administration.Or the National Announcers, as they like to style themselves.Eamon is itching for an end to the talking, the promising and the launching around the two big issues of the day - housing and broadband. He wants the Government to stop faffing about with their private-sector deals and start delivering some straightforward, State-funded, lasting solutions to chronic public problems. He sees a depressing similarity between the way the National Announcers have decided to tackle broadband and the way they have been trying to alleviate the housing crisis. The whole sorry scenario is too much for sensitive Green leader, who revealed that he scratching himself a lot now. We feared it triggered an outbreak of hives in poor Eamon, and not in the beekeeping sense. Either that, or nits, which can also be stress related.But, no, it’s due to the broadband, coming on top of the housing. Both of which, he said, seem to rely heavily on Government-promoted leasing schemes which are “effectively saying to private developers: You’ve a no-risk guaranteed income for 25 years and at the end of it, you own the asset”. Take broadband, a facility which Eamon dearly wishes to see rolled out everywhere as soon as possible. Nonetheless, he was pleased to hear the Taoiseach say an Oireachtas Committee will give his proposed national plan the full once over. “The more I look at this deal - and I really want to support it - but the more I look at it, I’m scratching my head thinking how can we have a private developer contributing €175 million in capital when we’re contributing between two and three billion, and they end up owning the asset?” he wondered aloud. The more Eamon thinks, the more the proposal doesn’t add up for him. The bidder, he pointed out, has only a small team without major backup. And yet, the Department of Communications has proven skills in this area, having delivered the metropolitan area network and brought in contractors. “So I’m scratching myself and thinking: How do we win over the Irish public to sell to them a deal where we give all the money and someone else gets ownership?”“I just can’t get beyond that,” he concluded. Might the deal be changed if the itchy heads on the Oireachtas committee start digging and find out something?“What’s the chance of us changing the deal, either on the ownership end or some other end? Where is the flexibility? Someone said last night that it’s legally tied down now, but I don’t believe that’s the case. I think we have a moment for change here before we sign a contract,” said Eamon, hopefully.The Taoiseach had left the chamber at this point as he had to catch a flight to Paris, but the Minister for Communications, Richard Bruton, was there to reply. Which he did, in considerable detail, because Richard has been living the National Broadband Plan for the last two weeks. The answer mightn’t have been the one Eamon was hoping to hear, but neither was the door slammed in his face. “There are fundamental constraints on what alternatives you can look at without starting afresh, abandoning this tender and starting a new procurement process.”Earlier, the leader of the Greens told the Taoiseach that the issue of housing is “coming up at the doors right across the country” as the local and European elections campaigns reach their final week. Leo didn’t need to be reminded about the polls - the Fianna Fáil leader did that when he had another pop at the Government’s financing arrangements for the rural broadband plan and questioned the timing of the deal’s announcement. Micheál Martin accused him of playing politics. “I would remind you it is not your money, it is the taxpayers’ money and you are electioneering here.”It was all very Itchy and Scratchy and the Taoiseach bristled. If he hadn’t announced the Government’s decision he would have been accused of hiding the detail until after the election.Nevertheless, the fact that a contract won’t be signed for months yet because the finer points are yet to be nailed down is definitely a cause for more head scratching.Housing is not an election friendly subject. “My assessment is the Government has completely lost the trust of the Irish people in this area,” said Eamon Ryan. Its political capital is “evaporating” in this area “because you are betting everything on a market where a market is unreliable”.Echoes of the current broadband debate, he dryly noted. He wants the State to take a more hands-on approach to developing State lands and welcomes the appointment of former Finance Department boss John Moran to the Land Development Agency.But the State needs to do more than “just giving a fat cheque to the private sector for 25 years where we are paying over the odds and start recognising we can do this ourselves. We can build cost-rental housing that’s high-quality, close to the centre, delivers for a variety of different people - a mix of people in social and public housing, but at the end of it, we own the asset, not some other private operator”.It’s the fundamental issue of our time, he told the Taoiseach. “You’re privatising everything. We wanted certain things to be in public ownership. Social housing should be in public ownership for use forever and a day for the people of Ireland,” he added, a note of despair in his voice.The Taoiseach agreed that they both agreed that people needed housing. But he favours a multi-faceted approach. If more people who are renting homes could be able to buy, that would be wonderful.“They can’t! They can’t!” chorused the opposition. “We must approach it in four or five different ways” to address the problem in a “practical, non-ideological” manner, declared Leo.Socialist Paul Murphy smiled and shook his head.

Photograph: UK ParliamentJessica TaylorPA WireTheresa May will meet senior Conservative backbenchers on Thursday to discuss a timetable for her resignation as hopes of passing her Brexit deal received a fresh blow.Labour said it would not support the government in a key vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill next month without further concessions on the prime minister’s Brexit deal.Mrs May’s spokesman said on Wednesday that the government planned to give the bill its second reading, which must be approved by a majority of MPs, in the week beginning June 3rd. A number of Conservative eurosceptics have promised to vote against the bill and the DUP’s deputy leader Nigel Dodds said his party will not vote for it as long as the withdrawal agreement remains unchanged.Jeremy Corbyn’s spokesman said Labour would not support the bill at its second reading unless it had reached an agreement with the government on the Brexit deal.“Without an agreement and real compromise and movement by the government out of these talks, we’re talking about a Withdrawal Agreement Bill that’s based on the same botched Brexit deal that has been rejected three times already by Parliament,” he said.When Mrs May meets the executive of the backbench 1922 Committee on Thursday, she is expected to outline a “roadmap” for her departure from Downing Street. She has already promised to step down as soon as her Brexit deal is approved but she is under pressure to name a departure date regardless of the fate of her Brexit deal.Potential renegeTalks between the government and Labour continued at official level on Wednesday but Mr Corbyn’s spokesman said that there remained gaps between their positions and they have reached no agreement. He said Labour feared that if Mrs May resigns within the next few weeks, her successor as Conservative leader could renege on any deal.“Jeremy made clear and the shadow cabinet’s made clear that we have serious concerns about negotiating with a government that is in a process of disintegration and what has been said about what might happen if a new Tory leadership is in charge and as we all know most of those potential alternative leaders have made clear that they don’t support this process, they don’t support the content of what has been discussed and they want to overturn it,” the spokesman said.There are a number of different entrenchment mechanisms and we’ve discussed them. The government has engaged seriously in those issues and there are a huge range of different options but obviously the more the possible overturning or withdrawal of support for anything that might be agreed becomes a reality, the more serious the entrenchment mechanisms need to be.”The prime minister’s spokesman said the government was talking to the DUP and other parties as well as Labour in an effort to find a majority for the bill.“We’re having lots of discussions across the House, with colleagues, with confidence and supply partners, with the opposition as you’ve seen. That work will continue as we strive to build a sustainable majority for this Bill. The imperative for passing it is I think entirely clear, which is that if we can get this legislation through then we will be able to give effect to the clearly expressed view of the British people in the referendum to leave the European Union, ” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3893575.1557947782!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"theresa may to give mps one last chance to back her brexit deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJeremy Corbyn: Labour will not support the  prime minister’s withdrawal Bill unless it has reached an agreement on the Brexit deal. Photograph: Jessica Taylor\u0026nbspTheresa May’s decision to introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) next month gives MPs one last chance to back the Brexit deal they have rejected three times. Brexit secretary Steve Barclay told the House of Lords EU committee that the government will not bring the deal back for a fifth time.“I think if the House of Commons does not approve the WAB then the Barnier deal is dead in that form,” he said.The government’s determination to give the Bill its second reading in the first week of June creates a number of challenges, logistical as well as political. MPs return from their Whitsun recess on Tuesday, June 4th, but the prime minister will be preoccupied for much of the week with Donald Trump’s state visit.The US president arrives in Britain on Monday, June 3rd, and his visit ends two days later with a D-Day commemoration in Portsmouth. May will leave with Trump that evening for Cherbourg where they will join other leaders for another D-Day commemoration on Thursday, June 6th.If scheduling the Bill’s second reading that week so that the vote is on a day when the prime minister can take part will be difficult, winning the vote looks almost impossible. The best result May has achieved for her deal until now was on March 29th, when MPs rejected the withdrawal agreement by 58 votes. The DUP remain opposed to the deal, along with Labour and other opposition parties and a few dozen Conservatives, perhaps more than the 34 who voted against the government on March 29th.Talks with LabourJeremy Corbyn’s spokesman said on Wednesday that Labour will not support the Bill’s second reading unless it has reached an agreement with the government on the Brexit deal. The spokesman declined to rule out abstaining in the vote but other Labour sources later suggested that if the party was not supporting the government it would vote against it.May’s hopes rest on two possibilities, the first of which is that next week’s European Parliament election results will be so bad for both main parties that they will be shocked into voting for the Bill as the quickest way of resolving Brexit. The other is that the talks with Labour, which continue despite grumbling from both sides, will bear some kind of fruit.Corbyn’s spokesman described the talks as “very extensive, very detailed and very serious over a long period of time”, adding that they discussed “every single aspect of the Brexit process and possible alternatives”. But the two sides remain at odds over the most important issues, including the customs union, and next week’s elections could make the gaps more difficult to bridge."},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph audio briefings sign new whatsapp group","story":"Want audio briefings direct to your WhatsApp?

That’s why we’ve got the fire extinguisher.“Take it off the hook now and you’ve got something to hit him with. You’d rather be prosecuted, wouldn’t you, for beating a patient to a pulp than that patient beating you to a pulp, wouldn’t you, as a choice of the two?”In a further alarming twist, he suggested the act of violence could be spun as “self-defence”, the paper reported.The driver eventually realises he had left the message after four minutes, commenting: “That was a long message on his phone.”The patient, who asked to remain anonymous, told  he had no history of being aggressive towards G4S staff and their message had left him distraught.G4S, which provides patient transport for NHS commissioning groups across Kent and Medway, said it was “appalled” by the comments and the two employees had been suspended “pending a full internal investigation”.Russell Hobbs, the managing director of the firm’s patient transport services, refused to say whether they had been suspended on full pay.Nadiya: Anxiety \u0026amp Me, review: the Bake Off winner\u0026#39s emotional journey

build first global map wood wide web highlight impact","story":"The first global map of the network of roots, bacteria and fungi beneath the ground known of the “wood wide web” has been built by researchers amid fears it is under threat by climate change. An international study, published in the journal Nature, made a visual model of mycorrhizal fungi networks based on data from 1.2 million forest tree plots in more than 70 countries.It is believed the findings could help shed light on how this unseen world is important to limiting climate change and how damage to the network could accelerate temperature rises.Researchers from Stanford University in the US and the Crowther Lab at ETH Zurich, Switzerland,  tapped into a vast database by the Global Forest Initiative to shape the work.Prof Thomas Crowther, one of the authors of the report, told the BBC: It\u0027s the first time that we\u0027ve been able to understand the world beneath our feet, but at a global scale.Just like an MRI scan of the brain helps us to understand how the brain works, this global map of the fungi beneath the soil helps us to understand how global ecosystems work.What we find is that certain types of microorganisms live in certain parts of the world, and by understanding that we can figure out how to restore different types of ecosystems and also how the climate is changing.A type of fungi known as EM - largely found in milder-climate forest - plays a role in trapping carbon from the atmosphere, while fungi found in the tropics, AM, accelerates carbon cycling.This would have the knock-on effect of speeding up climate change, the report claimed. Nadiya: Anxiety \u0026amp Me, review: the Bake Off winner\u0026#39s emotional journey should prove an inspirationComment: Jeremy

The\u0026nbsppay claim seriously complicates them\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentAsda faces an equal pay claim from thousands of shop workersAsda and Walmart executives have doubtless spent the day fielding calls from investment bankers keen to get involved in what could turn in to a very chunky flotation.It follows Walmart International chief executive Judith McKenna telling a meeting of 1,200 managers that an IPO of Britain’s number three supermarket chain - soon to be number two given the way it’s performing vis a vis Sainsbury’s - is being “seriously considered”.\u0026nbspAt the same time, McKenna reportedly warned that the path to such a share offering, in the wake of failure of the American retail giant’s attempt to merged the business with Sainsbury’s, could take years. Those bankers should take note.\u0026nbspAsda could be floated on stock market after failed Sainsbury\u0027s mergerChickens stepped on and left convulsing at Nando\u0027s and Asda supplier Asda has been in the midst of an impressive revival, having posted seven consecutive quarters of growth. Its owner, which has its eyes on sexier, faster growing markets, would probably like to use this to drum up interest from a bidder who might be willing to pay a premium. But there’s been a conspicuous lack of interest following the Competition \u0026amp Markets Authority’s decision to block the merger.The UK’s competitive grocery sector, combined with the Brexit related uncertainties stoked by a dismal government and the grim political climate that’s emerged from them, make it a less than attractive market to enter right now.\u0026nbspBut Asda also has another issue to grapple with: An equal pay claim involving thousands of GMB members that is back in court in Manchester this week.\u0026nbspAt issue is the difference in pay rates offered to the largely female staff working in its stores when compared to those enjoyed by warehouse workers, who are predominantly male.\u0026nbspThe claim holds that their jobs are of comparable value\u0026nbspand so the same should be true of their wages. Law firm Leigh Day, which is litigating the case, has to date been clocking up victories at a rate even Manchester City might envy.\u0026nbspThe dispute didn’t generate a lot of attention when the merger still looked like a runner and perhaps it should have. The costs could be astronomical if Asda’s workers take it all the way and find the back of the net. They’d be more than enough to put any talk about an IPO on indefinite hold.\u0026nbspThe GMB has sought a meeting with Walmart bosses to discuss the potential flotation\u0026nbspand the group\u0027s plans for the business.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. 130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”.

Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. Netflix currently has a large lead over its competitors after adding a record 9.6 million new subscribers in the first three months of the year taking it to a total of 149 million.But Disney has an unrivalled back catalogue of television programmes and movies including the Star Wars and Marvel franchises.Not all of that content will be available when the company launches its first solo venture later this year, kids-focused streaming service Disney Plus.\u0026nbspAccording to executives, Disney is considering offering Hulu as a bundle alongside Disney Plus\u0026nbspand its sports service, ESPN Plus.AT\u0026ampT came by its Hulu stake after buying Time Warner, which invested $583m in Hulu in 2016.

The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition.

It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. 130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time.

In an era when extravagance had well and truly taken hold, the staging was notably bare. The orchestra, the belting, the key changes, and the five backing singers dressed as a cross between beauty queens and security guards all make this feel like the climax of a modern opera. Has Eurovision ever seen anything like it, before or since? Finland’s first win after 45 years of participating came at the hands of a heavy metal band dressed in monster costumes – but this ranking is not based on novelty alone. Behind the growled vocals and pyrotechnics, “Hard Rock Hallelujah” is a pretty great song – even for those who ordinarily can’t stand this kind of thing. The backing vocals on the chorus are a particular high. It also provided a welcome departure from the high-octane pop-fest that many believe Eurovision to be. The jewel in the crown of Ireland’s seven wins is this corker from Logan, who returned looking every inch the matinee idol in his pristine white suit. It’s the kind of big power ballad that fist-clenching was made for, and his big build on “I will always love you” should win another prize for the most ambitious key change.One of Sweden’s most popular entries, Carola is winning from the moment she bounds on stage and lets out that first “Woah-oh-oh!”. Her voice is flawless, the key changes are great, and who doesn’t appreciate a wind machine? Another slice of Scandi pop perfection.A high energy pop song with colourful young performers and fun choreography – “Making Your Mind Up” is the stuff that Eurovision is made of. The famous moment when the boys ripped off the girls’ skirts only to reveal shorter skirts beneath them is one of the competition’s most famous moments. A number one hit record across Europe that year, the song remains as infectious today as ever.Celine Dion was just 20 years old when she came to international attention with this performance. The song itself is excellent – a French chanson worthy of Edith Piaf, with a slightly twee drum machine stepping up the beat for a bop of a chorus. This all took place before Celine was transformed into an ageless power ballad queen (see the pageant-esque hair and outfit), but it’s thrilling to hear how her vocals were sheer perfection even then. Oh, and the arm choreography was well on its way too.710 4. “Love Shine a Light” – Katrina and the Waves (United Kingdom, 1997) The beautiful fusion of hammond organ, tambourines, hand clapping and the quasi-spiritual lyrics themselves make this feel like a glorious hymn – and Katrina really takes it to church. One of the highest scorers in modern times, this was the last time the UK won the competition, and it came the day after Labour’s landslide 1997 election victory. What a time to be alive.Conchita’s performance had everything you could want in a Eurovision performance. Elegant and fierce all at once, “Rise Like a Phoenix” could match the finest Bond theme, and is easily one of the most timeless of all the winners. The big band adds to the glamour of it all, and brings the goosebumps on that dramatic orchestral rise towards the final chorus. It was a powerful moment for LGBT+ visibility, too the song’s theme of triumph over adversity secured it as an anthem for life’s survivors.It’s hard to pick any other recent winner that comes as close to contemporary chart toppers as “Euphoria” – a dance hit that many contemporary pop stars would kill for. Written by Sweden’s Thomas G:son – who has produced more than 90 songs for Eurovision competitors across multiple countries – “Euphoria” is built on clever pop formulas. The chorus itself is anthemic perfection, but when Loreen tacks on: “We’re going up, up, up...” it strikes gold. The Kate Bush-esque performance was an added bonus.ABBA burst onto the stage at the 1974 competition, kickstarting Sweden’s international reputation as masters of pop. Early adopters of the kind of kitsch which would come to typify the show, ABBA used their platform to offer a taste of the cultural phenomenon they would go on to become. From the opening piano build to the switch between a minor bridge and major chorus, to the catchy hooks littered throughout, “Waterloo” is a masterclass in how to write a hit, and the song rightly went on to become one of the best-selling singles of all time. ABBA continue to influence Eurovision contestants to this day, and while you may have another favourite, “Waterloo” is a song on which most people can agree is a solid gold classic. We promise to love you forever more.Let’s get down to business. Making their debut at Eurovision, Serbia later romped home as champions with this high-drama ballad.

Has Eurovision ever seen anything like it, before or since? Finland’s first win after 45 years of participating came at the hands of a heavy metal band dressed in monster costumes – but this ranking is not based on novelty alone. Behind the growled vocals and pyrotechnics, “Hard Rock Hallelujah” is a pretty great song – even for those who ordinarily can’t stand this kind of thing. The backing vocals on the chorus are a particular high. It also provided a welcome departure from the high-octane pop-fest that many believe Eurovision to be. The jewel in the crown of Ireland’s seven wins is this corker from Logan, who returned looking every inch the matinee idol in his pristine white suit. It’s the kind of big power ballad that fist-clenching was made for, and his big build on “I will always love you” should win another prize for the most ambitious key change.One of Sweden’s most popular entries, Carola is winning from the moment she bounds on stage and lets out that first “Woah-oh-oh!”. Her voice is flawless, the key changes are great, and who doesn’t appreciate a wind machine? Another slice of Scandi pop perfection.A high energy pop song with colourful young performers and fun choreography – “Making Your Mind Up” is the stuff that Eurovision is made of. The famous moment when the boys ripped off the girls’ skirts only to reveal shorter skirts beneath them is one of the competition’s most famous moments. A number one hit record across Europe that year, the song remains as infectious today as ever.Celine Dion was just 20 years old when she came to international attention with this performance. The song itself is excellent – a French chanson worthy of Edith Piaf, with a slightly twee drum machine stepping up the beat for a bop of a chorus. This all took place before Celine was transformed into an ageless power ballad queen (see the pageant-esque hair and outfit), but it’s thrilling to hear how her vocals were sheer perfection even then. Oh, and the arm choreography was well on its way too.710 4. “Love Shine a Light” – Katrina and the Waves (United Kingdom, 1997) The beautiful fusion of hammond organ, tambourines, hand clapping and the quasi-spiritual lyrics themselves make this feel like a glorious hymn – and Katrina really takes it to church. One of the highest scorers in modern times, this was the last time the UK won the competition, and it came the day after Labour’s landslide 1997 election victory. What a time to be alive.Conchita’s performance had everything you could want in a Eurovision performance. Elegant and fierce all at once, “Rise Like a Phoenix” could match the finest Bond theme, and is easily one of the most timeless of all the winners. The big band adds to the glamour of it all, and brings the goosebumps on that dramatic orchestral rise towards the final chorus. It was a powerful moment for LGBT+ visibility, too the song’s theme of triumph over adversity secured it as an anthem for life’s survivors.It’s hard to pick any other recent winner that comes as close to contemporary chart toppers as “Euphoria” – a dance hit that many contemporary pop stars would kill for. Written by Sweden’s Thomas G:son – who has produced more than 90 songs for Eurovision competitors across multiple countries – “Euphoria” is built on clever pop formulas. The chorus itself is anthemic perfection, but when Loreen tacks on: “We’re going up, up, up...” it strikes gold. The Kate Bush-esque performance was an added bonus.ABBA burst onto the stage at the 1974 competition, kickstarting Sweden’s international reputation as masters of pop. Early adopters of the kind of kitsch which would come to typify the show, ABBA used their platform to offer a taste of the cultural phenomenon they would go on to become. From the opening piano build to the switch between a minor bridge and major chorus, to the catchy hooks littered throughout, “Waterloo” is a masterclass in how to write a hit, and the song rightly went on to become one of the best-selling singles of all time. ABBA continue to influence Eurovision contestants to this day, and while you may have another favourite, “Waterloo” is a song on which most people can agree is a solid gold classic. We promise to love you forever more.Let’s get down to business. Making their debut at Eurovision, Serbia later romped home as champions with this high-drama ballad.

The company is known for its passionate community of supporters, who were in evidence at simultaneous live launch events in London, New York and Bangalore, which all sold out quickly.OnePlus habitually releases one phone in the spring and another in the autumn. Last year, the company launched the OnePlus 6 and OnePlus 6T across the year. Today, though, two new phones were revealed, the OnePlus 7 and the OnePlus 7 Pro.CEO Pete Lau, live on stage in London, said that the phone he was revealing was the closest the company has come to the perfect product.It’s certainly a headline-grabber and a pretty large handset: the display measures 6.67 inches, almost 0.2 inches more than the largest iPhone, the iPhone XS Max.But where the iPhone has a camera unit that cuts a notch out of the top area of the display, here the phone is all-screen, no camera. More than 93 per cent of the phone’s front is screen. Unlike many all-screen phones, the display does not end abruptly above a big chin at the bottom, even if the tiny bezel is not quite even all the way around.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Samsung will cancel orders of its Galaxy Fold phone at the end of May if the phone is not then ready for sale.

When needed, the front-facing camera rises up out of the body of the handset, takes its photo as required, and slides back out of view. It’s a smooth movement completed in 0.53 seconds and tested to do so 300,000 times, that is 150 times a day for 5.5 years.Additionally, if you drop the phone with the camera protruding, it automatically senses it is falling and retracts the camera safely. (I have tried this a few times and it has worked every time,\u0026nbspeven if it was unsettling to do.)The camera sits a little off-centre, which is surprising at first but quickly becomes familiar.The result is a phone that looks astonishing: nothing but screen and strikingly high-resolution (516 pixels per inch). The glass has gently pillowed edges which mean the phone, though certainly large, is still comfortable in the hand. The fast refresh rated (90Hz) aims to deliver a smooth result, even when gaming or watching fast-moving video. The curved edges also mean notifications can be displayed as a moving light on the screen edge, visible from a distance across the room.It can display HDR content, both in the basic HDR10 version and the newer HDR10+ format – something very few other phone screens can manage.The OnePlus 7 Pro has Gorilla Glass front and back but the glass back is not used to introduce wireless charging, something the company has eschewed in the past. Although it says it hasn’t shunned the increasingly popular technology, but instead it seems to value the faster recharge that wired charging allows.Several times, OnePlus spokespeople talked about the ultra-slim profile of the phone, so perhaps the wireless charging coil would have fattened it up too much.The new, powerful charger in the box will deliver a zero to 50 per cent charge in 20 minutes.The phone comes in three colours, Mirror Grey, a shiny near-black finish, Nebula Blue which is more matte and highly colourful (and a colour inspired by the universe, we were told), and an elegant light colour called Almond.Screen unlock is done via a fingerprint sensor buried in the display. The last phone, the OnePlus 6T, also had this and it’s pretty cool. Touch your thumb on the thumbprint icon onscreen and an electric fizzing animation appears, letting you in faster than before.Cameras are always key elements on smartphones and here the main camera is a 48-megapixel sensor at a larger size than last year. Pixel binning, where adjacent photosites are combined to let more light in more accurately, aims to help create better photos.There are two other rear cameras, a telephoto lens which offers 3x the zoom of the main unit, with eight-megapixel resolution and an ultra-wide lens which has a 0.6x zoom comparted to the regular lens. That’s a 16-megapixel sensor. These cameras are a big step up from last year’s phones.OnePlus boss Pete Lau explains why 5G phones are the futureOnePlus 7 leak reveals pop-up camera and massive screenThe front camera, by the way, the one that peeps up and back again, has a 16-megapixel resolution.The processor and active memory on the OnePlus 7 are also designed for speed. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Pro is leading-edge and is matched by up to 12GB of RAM.OnePlus is known for delivering high-end specifications at mid-range prices. The rumour was that this policy might run out this time. In fact, the price is pretty keen: from £649, rising to £799 with the 12GB of RAM and 256GB storage capacity. Apart from the almond colour, which is on sale in June, other versions of the OnePlus 7 Pro are instore from next Tuesday, 21 May.OnePlus also announced something called Zen Mode that encourages you to take a break from your phone: launch the app and the OnePlus 7 Pro can only do two things, use your camera and make emergency phone calls, for the next 20 minutes. Once started, you can’t change your mind, you just have to wait. I really like the sound of this, though I wonder how much I’ll use it.The second phone of the day, the OnePlus 7, was left to late in the keynote. While not an afterthought, with many of the OnePlus 7 Pro features meaning it is a tidy upgrade from the OnePlus 6T from last year, it was in the bigger phone’s shadow. Still, it is keenly priced, selling for £499, the same price as last year’s OnePlus 6T. It goes on sale in June.There was one more phone announced, the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G, revealed by Pete Lau, Cristiano Amon, the President of Qualcomm, And Mark Allera, CEO of BT’s Consumer Brands. They talked about the power of 5G and predicted the “era of the super-apps”. The prediction was that 5G phones would be thicker and heavier, but OnePlus claims the new phone is near-identical to the 4G OnePlus 7 Pro. Though no date or price was revealed, the company’s first 5G handset was confirmed as coming soon and will be on the EE network.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

My life\u0027s work is my legacy and I haven\u0027t got a spoilt child to run the business.”He plans to stay involved in the business, but a management board will oversee day-to-day operations, along with a newly set up colleagues\u0027 advisory council and trustees.The colleagues\u0027 advisory council will be chaired by a trustee and will be made up of current staff and will represent their interests and concerns.David Robinson, chairman of Richer Sounds, said: “It\u0027s incredibly exciting times and allows our colleagues to feel even more connected to the company.“They have a real stake in the success of the business and can take pride in knowing that they are shareholders, building for the future.”Mr Richer, who founded the business in 1978 at the age of 19, had long planned to hand control of the firm to staff and had already written the plan into his will, but wanted to ensure he could oversee the transition.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After face-to-face talks between Mr Corbyn and Ms May, Labour said it would not support the bill without a compromise agreement complete with safeguards to avoid it being unpicked by a future Tory leader. “We are not in the business of getting into a car when we don’t know where it’s going,” said one source.But senior Labour sources refused to rule out the party’s MPs being whipped to abstain in the crucial second reading vote, potentially saving the PM from defeat at the hands of Leave-backing Tory rebels and the DUP.What does the timetable for Theresa May’s departure look like now?Brexit and austerity: the toxic cocktail the young can’t escape Fox claims accepting chlorinated chicken would not affect food safetyHoliday company Tui hit by Brexit uncertainty and 737 Max groundingThe move sparked a hostile response from backers of a second referendum, including one senior shadow cabinet minister who said he would ignore any instruction to abstain.Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray said: “Labour must not issue a blank cheque to Theresa May over Brexit.“Abstaining would be allowing a Tory Brexit to go ahead without even pressing for a People’s Vote and that would be totally unacceptable, so I hope the party leadership will make it clear that it’s just not on.”\u0026nbspFormer Labour MP Chuka Umunna, chief spokesperson\u0026nbspfor Change UK, said: “By refusing to rule out abstaining on the second reading of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, the Labour Party is offering Theresa May and her Brexit plan a lifeline. This is the clearest indication yet that the Labour leadership is working with the Tory government to deliver Brexit.”Supporters of EU membership had been buoyed by Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay’s admission that defeat for the WAB would be the final death knell for the deal laboriously negotiated over two years and agreed with the EU in November.Mr Barclay told a parliamentary committee that if the bill falls “then the Barnier deal is dead in that form and I think the House will have to then address a much more fundamental question between whether it will pursue ... a no-deal option or whether it will revoke”.Downing Street indicated that discussions will take place in the coming weeks not only with Mr Corbyn’s party but also with Tory backbenchers and the\u0026nbspDUP, aiming to win\u0026nbsp“the broadest possible support” for the bill’s passage through the Commons. Asked whether Ms May would go ahead even if no such coalition can be assembled, a source said: “We are going to bring the bill forward in that week.”Cross-party talks with Labour are continuing at official level, but no “plenary” meetings between ministers and their counterparts have been announced.Ms May faces a tough challenge fitting an expected two-day second reading vote into a week when she will be busy with the three-day state visit of the US president, Donald Trump, and D-Day commemorations in Portsmouth and Normandy. Time is even tighter because parliament is not currently scheduled to sit on the Monday or Friday.Aides shrugged off the timing issue, saying Number 10 was “fully aware” of the busy schedule. They declined to say whether the\u0026nbspWAB\u0026nbspwould be published ahead of the Whitsun recess, beginning on 23 May, to give\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbsptime to digest the long\u0026nbspand complex constitutional legislation.Created with Sketch.Who could succeed Theresa May as Conservative leader?

It is a personal priority of mine that we get this resolved and we stop this chilling effect that is claiming veterans who really deserve our care and respect.”Ms\u0026nbspMordaunt\u0026nbspsaid she had discussed her concerns with Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley, and insisted she would learn from the mistakes of the Iraq Historic Allegations Team, which degenerated into the “pursuit of profit” by “legal firms interested in making a quick buck”.“This is not about preventing someone who has committed a crime facing justice. This is about stopping an industry that surrounds these processes which is not about the pursuit of justice,” she said.However Downing Street said Northern Ireland was covered by a separate process and the\u0026nbspMinistry of Defence‘s views were simply being fed in.It comes amid anger from Tory\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspover prosecutions of British troops, including Soldier F, who has been charged with the killing of two people during Bloody Sunday in 1972.The news also prompted mixed views\u0026nbspfrom Northern Ireland parties.DUP MP Gavin Robinson demanded clarity and\u0026nbspsaid it would be “shameful” if “leadership ambitions are taking priority over a coherent plan to end persecution of veterans”.He said\u0026nbspany proposal to protect veterans from prosecution would “apply equally across the UK”.But Sinn Fein MLA Linda Dillon said “any attempt to create immunity for the British Army was wrong”.“No British soldier should be above the law and whether crimes have been committed in Ireland or Iraq, those crimes should be investigated and those responsible held to account,” she said.Ms Mordaunt also\u0026nbspreaffirmed\u0026nbspa pledge to derogate from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) before\u0026nbspsignificant military operations, which ministers say would\u0026nbspprevent veterans from being hounded through the courts.In 2016, Theresa May announced that the government will adopt a presumption that it will suspend aspects of the\u0026nbspECHR\u0026nbspduring\u0026nbsptimes of war to end an “industry of vexatious claims” against soldiers years later.But human rights groups expressed outrage at the plan, saying “war is not a legal black hole”.Sam Grant, policy and campaigns manager at Liberty, said: “Nothing in the ECHR prevents soldiers from being soldiers – but it is important to have accountability for gross abuses of human rights on the battlefield or off.“Derogation will not prevent the proper investigation of credible allegations of abuse during wartime: it is simply not possible to derogate from the right to life or the prohibition on torture.“It will only serve to undermine the fundamental rights and hinder accountability upon which both soldiers and civilians rely.”May refuses to release Huawei leak report to sacked WilliamsonGavin Williamson will not be given copy of report which led to firingWilliamson to receive £17,000 pay-off despite Huawei leak sackingLiberal Democrat defence spokesperson\u0026nbspJamie Stone said the move would set a “deeply concerning precedent” over the UK’s commitment to human rights in conflicts.He said: “The ECHR is totally separate from the EU and this Tory government do not have any mandate to tear up the UK’s commitment to human rights and the rule of law.“The UK must condemn and reject abuses of human rights in whatever form they take, including in cases of torture.“Far from hindering our armed forces, the ECHR has strengthened them, whether by allowing gay people to serve openly or by requiring the government to equip British soldiers properly when it sends them into combat.“This regressive step would see us diminished further in the eyes of our global allies and is unjustifiable.”Ministry of DefenceThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Groups such as the ACLU point to its test of Amazon’s facial recognition programme – called Amazon Rekognition – as proof, after scanning images of members of Congress and comparing them to archived arrest photos. Twenty-eight legislators were incorrectly matched, including six members of the Congressional Black Caucus.Meanwhile, critics say police need all the help they can get, especially in a city with high-profile events and high rates of property crime. That people expect privacy in public space is unreasonable given the proliferation of cell phones and surveillance cameras, said Meredith Serra, a member of a resident public safety group Stop Crime SF.“To me, the ordinance seems to be a costly additional layer of bureaucracy that really does nothing to improve the safety of our citizens,” she said at the same hearing.San Francisco’s new rule, which is set to go into effect in a month if a second vote, considered a formality goes ahead, forbids the use of facial-recognition technology by the city’s 53 departments — including the San Francisco police department, which doesn’t currently use such technology, CNN said. However, the ordinance carves out an exception for federally controlled facilities at San Francisco International Airport and the Port of San Francisco.\u0026nbspLate last year, the president of Microsoft called for greater government regulation of AI facial recognition technology, because of the risk of it discriminating against women and people of colour.Brad Smith said such regulation would help avoid “a commercial race to the bottom, with tech companies forced to choose between social responsibility and market success”.Facial recognition tech trained on of photos of people without consentBefore facial recognition tech can be used, it needs to be limitedTaylor Swift uses facial recognition software to identify stalkersNew iPhone to improve facial recognition feature, report claimsThe comments of Mr Smith, 59, which were released at the same time as a report by a research group consisting of both Microsoft and Google employees also calling for more regulation, are especially noteworthy because of the controversy the company triggered earlier this year over comments about its work with AI.In June, the company’s general manager Tom Keane, wrote how proud Microsoft was to be working with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) to use facial recognition technology to help identify immigrants and process applications.Additional reporting by Associated PressOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Incan terraces still cover the hillsides around Chinchero and are used by local farmers.Those protesting against the airport fear it will cause structural damage to ancient ruins and environmental degradation across a large swathe of the\u0026nbspSacred Valley, not just the famed citadel of Machu\u0026nbspPicchu\u0026nbspitself.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UNESCO World Heritage sites threatened by rising sea levels Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coastal protections are already being developed to shield Venice from flooding.

But the new airport in Chinchero will be open to larger planes on international routes across Latin America and the US.The project was first announced in 2012 by Peru’s former president Ollanta Humala and the government plans to complete the airport by 2023.At the time, Mr Humala said the government would invest $460m\u0026nbsp(£350m) in the project, not including compensation to the farming communities whose land will be seized.Announcing the project seven years ago, he said: “The new airport will not only allow more tourists to come, but will also generate more jobs and will permit modernisation and added value for the surrounding communities.”But critics say the airport will bring noise and air pollution to the area and put a strain on limited water sources in the region.Machu Picchu is now wheelchair accessibleMachu Picchu introduces strict time slots for visitorsTourist falls to his death posing for a mid-leap photo at Machu PicchuThey have also expressed concerns that planes landing and taking off from the airport would need to pass low over the nearby Ollantaytambo archaeological park. They say this could cause structural damage to the Inca ruins in the park.More than 1.5 million tourists visited Machu Picchu in 2018, which is almost double the limit recommended by Unesco.In 2017,\u0026nbspUnesco\u0026nbspthreatened to put the citadel on its list of world heritage sites in danger, owing to the huge strain tourism puts on the fragile ruins and local ecology.Already, the Peruvian government has introduced a number of measures to curb overcrowding, including introducing strict time slots for visitors and\u0026nbspone-way circuits around the ruins.\u0026nbspJustin Francis, chief executive\u0026nbspof sustainable travel company Responsible Travel, told The  that he was worried about the impact the new airport and potential increase in visitor numbers would have on Machu Picchu.“I thought I’d seen it all,”\u0026nbsphe said. “When we look back at what went wrong with tourism, this will be the story that sums it all up.“Here, our world view that tourism growth is infinite rams up against the fact that every destination has a finite capacity, and more so a 15th-century Inca hilltop citadel.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The group held rallies to “defend against gypsy criminality” in areas with large Roma populations before eventually being banned by the Hungarian courts in 2009.Mr Toroczkai said that his new group\u0026nbsp“is not the legal successor to the Hungarian Guard” but added that it “wants to continue its idealism and altruism”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

He said: \u0027It is absolutely clear a homosexual should not be a teacher\u0027Jobbik is currently the largest opposition party in the Hungarian parliament, having pushed to soften its image. Mr Toroczkai left Jobbik last year and has accused his former party of betraying the “national cause”.Mr Toroczkai has claimed the new group would be available to provide help after natural disasters and to support people facing evictions from their homes.However, Vince Szava, head of the Hungarian National Ethnic Minorities Interest Protection Association, condemned the National Legion’s formation and said he hoped it will be disbanded by the authorities.\u0026nbsp“We have to prevent the advance of parties and organisations with neo-Nazi ideas,” said Mr Szava, who is Roma.\u0026nbspMr Toroczkai said the National Legion would also serve as an umbrella organisation for similar groups and has unspecified legal strategies to use if Hungarian authorities try to break up the group.He said his party would\u0026nbsphold a march next week in the eastern city of Torokszentmiklos – despite a police ban. The march comes as a Roma man is suspected of injuring several people in a series of unprovoked attacks in the city.\u0026nbspThe party has appealed the ban in court, but will try to hold it in some form even if the appeal is rejected.The National Legion’s formal founding ceremony will take place on 1 June in the southern city of Szeged.\u0026nbspMr Toroczkai’s party is running for Hungary’s 21 seats in the European parliament in elections later this month, with its manifesto calling for a parliament led by “patriotic forces”. However, current projections have them only gaining about 2 per cent of the vote\u0026nbsp– not enough to gain a seat.Speaking to BBC’s HARDtalk in March, Mr Toroczkai said he was against migration into Hungary, using similar language to that describing the formation of the National Legion.“We need to defend our culture. I respect the Islam in Saudi Arabia but Hungary is a Christian country. Our traditions are Christian traditions,” he said.“The European Union is not working now, the EU cannot preserve the European culture. Who will defend the European people? The European nations?”US ambassador suggests Trump would ‘love’ an illiberal democracyViktor Orban faces calls for investigation into spending of EU fundsEU centre-right group to debate kicking out Viktor Orban’s partyHungary’s president Viktor Orban, who has also faced criticism from across Europe for his nationalist policies, including being tough on migration and calling for judicial reforms, met with President Donald Trump in Washington on Monday.Mr Trump brushed off concerns from critics about the weakening of democracy in Hungary since Mr Orban came to power.“He’s a respected man. And I know he’s a tough man, but he’s a respected man,” Mr Trump said.“He’s done the right thing, according to many people, on immigration. And you look at some of the problems that they have in Europe that are tremendous because they’ve done it a different way than the prime minister,” Mr Trump added.Associated Press contributed to this reportOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

BTS does not support a boycott of Israel, but campaigns to end the military occupation of the West Bank.The gaggle of mostly European tourists they took around Hebron snaked through the settlement areas\u0026nbspand streets of shuttered Palestinians shops.At the last point of the tour when the group was due to meet Palestinian peace activists, the Israeli military issued a warrant temporarily designating\u0026nbspthe area\u0026nbspas a\u0026nbsp“closed military zone”.\u0026nbspEveryone had to leave.“Enjoy Eurovision,” Amro shouts to the retreating group he was not permitted to meet.“One day we’ll have Hebron-vision. I promise,” he jokes.This vignette is one of many to have\u0026nbspunderscored the tensions at this year’s Eurovision in Israel, one of the most political fraught and contentious ones\u0026nbspyet.Just over a week before celebrations were due to kick off, and ahead of the arrival of Madonna, who is due to headline the finale on Saturday, the country looked like it was on the cusp of a war with militants in Gaza.Palestinian armed groups fired nearly 700 rockets and projectiles at the south of the country in just two days.Israel responded by pounding 350 targets within the besieged territory.Thirty were killed on both sides, in one of the bloodiest upticks of violence since the 2014 war, before Egypt and the United Nations were able to broker a temporary and fragile ceasefire that still holds. For now.Hackers also broke into a live-stream webcast of the competition with a false rocket alarm and images of explosions.Viewers tuning in to the webcast on Tuesday were warned: “Risk of Missile Attack. Please Take Shelter,” under a fake logo of the Israeli army, followed by images of explosions near the Eurovision venue.“Israel is NOT safe. You will see!”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIsrael’s public broadcaster alleged that Hamas, the group that\u0026nbsprules the Gaza Strip, was behind the hack.In what can only exacerbate\u0026nbsptensions,\u0026nbspthe week chosen for Eurovision coincides with several difficult anniversaries.Wednesday, day two of Eurovision, is known as Nakba day (“day of the catastrophe”) by Palestinians, who each 15 May commemorate when some 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced to leave their homes during the conflict which surrounded the creation of Israel.During last year’s protests for Nakba day, Israeli snipers killed nearly 60 people along the Gaza border fence, another bloody anniversary prominent in many minds.Many are also angered by the location of Eurovision.The Expo Centre in Tel Aviv, where the acts are performing, is built over the ruins of Palestinian village Shaykh Muwannis, while Eurovision’s sprawling seafront village is constructed over the ruins of a mostly Arab, pre-1948 neighbourhood called Al-Manshiyya.And so the event has\u0026nbspalso been hounded by activists spearheaded by the Palestinian-led campaign Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS).Earlier in the year the group\u0026nbsprecruited the support of dozens of British celebrities including Vivienne Westwood, actor Julie Christie and singer Peter Gabriel, who signed a letter published by  calling on the BBC to demand that Eurovision be relocated.The BDS campaign, which is effectively outlawed by the Israeli authorities who passed legislation against it two years ago, has not prevented any of the competition’s 41 acts from joining in the show, or thousands flying into to enjoy the festivities.However, it has seen a number of protests pop up across Israel and the Palestinian territories.On Tuesday evening, while jubilant crowds gathered to watch the opening of Eurovision on huge screens at Tel Aviv’s Eurovision village, local and international activists blocked streets in other parts of the country’s commercial and cultural hub.A few days ago, as the competition’s acts strutted down the red carpet, more than a dozen Israeli and international pro-Palestinian activists wearing blindfolds knelt in rows and tried to prevent people accessing the venue, saying they were protesting “cultural washing”.More rallies have been planned for Saturday by “No Pride in Apartheid”, a protest group of Israeli feminists and anarchists.In fact, an entire “protest” alternative to Eurovision is underway.“Gaza Message”, saw Palestinian musicians on Tuesday play among the ruins of buildings bombed in the last round of Israeli strikes.Thousands to boycott Airbnb over listings in occupied West Bank“Gazavision”, which mimics the Eurovision structure, will also be held later in the week as an entirely separate music competition showcasing the Palestinian talent forbidden to travel to international competitions.It is unclear how much of an impact it has had. The Israelis have launched a determined PR campaign countering calls for a boycott, with Israeli public broadcaster Kan releasing\u0026nbspa tongue-in-cheek musical advert, quipping that Israel is “much more” than a “land war and occupation”.\u0026nbspThe government has taken a tough approach to the boycott movement that it accuses\u0026nbspof having ties to “terrorism and antisemitism”.A spokesperson from Israel’s Ministry of Strategic Affairs tells\u0026nbspThe Independent that music is a means “best used to build bridges and unite people, not ide them”.The ministry accuses\u0026nbspthe boycott movement of trying to manipulate public opinion on social media “to no success”.“Such actions only reveal the true face of BDS – they have no interest in dialogue but rather try to promote ision,” the ministry adds.At the Eurovision village, as the semi-finals kicks\u0026nbspoff, most visitors are\u0026nbsppreoccupied with who is\u0026nbspgoing to win.“To be honest I haven’t really noticed anything about any protests but Eurovision is a moment where everyone comes together which is more important,” says\u0026nbspJan, from the Netherlands, who says\u0026nbspit is\u0026nbspparticularly important for his country as\u0026nbspits\u0026nbspentrant is the favourite.Michael Rice, the UK’s contestant, admits\u0026nbsphe has not heard much about conflict, or rocket fire, before he landed in Tel Aviv but saw there were some acts, like the Iceland’s entrant Hatari who visited Hebron and have called publicly for an end to the occupation.“I don’t really know much about it, as I’m not really political, but I have seen a lot about the boycott movement,” he tells\u0026nbspThe Independent during a launch party held by the British embassy before Eurovision kicked off.Eurovision is staving off Israeli-Palestinian conflict – for now“But every country has something going on,” he adds.Madonna, who is due to make a guest appearance on Saturday, has, however, come under fire, particularly because her Ray of Light foundation, a social justice program, supports a number of Palestinian projects, including funding teachers’ salaries at UN schools across Gaza.The Queen of Pop has\u0026nbspdefended her decision to play, saying in a statement to Reuters: “I’ll never stop playing music to suit someone’s political agenda nor will I stop speaking out against violations of human rights wherever in the world they may be.”“I hope and pray that we will soon break free from this terrible cycle of destruction and create a new path towards peace.”Breaking the Silence plans to run many more tours over the week.Avner Gvaryahu, a former Israeli paratrooper and one of the leading members of the group, says\u0026nbspthat members of Eurovision delegations and even some performers have\u0026nbspreached out to them to join tours.“We have to end this military occupation for sake of Israelis and Palestinians. We are breaking the silence, part of our job is shedding a light on some of these hardships,” he tells\u0026nbspThe Independent.Wolf Alice back Eurovision boycott of \u0027human rights abusers\u0027 Israel“The thinking was that it was important that the people who came to enjoy this place, and the liberal values of Eurovision, take another step.“That they don’t just enjoy the nightlife in Tel Aviv, the beach during the day, but understand the complexity of the place that they’re in,” he adds.\u0026nbspMany on their tour, who knew little about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict before getting on the bus, find\u0026nbspthemselves flanked and heckled by heavily armed settlers, as well as tailed by the military. They say\u0026nbspit was important trip to take.\u0026nbsp“Eurovision is an opportunity for Israel to present themselves as white washing what is going on here,” says\u0026nbspKarl, 24, from Germany, who was on his first trip to the country.“People have flocked to parties on the beach, they are waving the flags with no understanding of what is going on around them. This tour is called breaking the silence for a reason.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Meanwhile, almost all national channels, owned by pro-government businesses, ignored the broadcast.Official news bulletins focused on the claims by the Justice and Development Party (AKP) of “irregularities and corruption”, which were cited by the board in its decision for a rerun of mayoral elections. The vote will be held on 23 June.In a televised speech the next day, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkish president and chair of the AKP, insisted there had been improper appointments of some election officials and claimed some had links to terror groups.Created with Sketch.Election in Turkey: the reaction in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Supporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate in IstanbulA supporter of Mr Erdogan carries his portrait in front of a Turkish flagFollowing the election, a shipowner reads a newspaper that covers the resultSupporters of Muharrem Ince, defeated opposition candidate, wait outside the Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP) headquarters following Mr Erdogan\u0027s claim of victoryPeople in an Instanbul barber shop listen to Muharrem Ince\u0027s speech following the resultsSupporters of the pro-Kurdish People\u0027s Democratic Party (HDP) hold photos of its leader Selahatin DemirtasSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate outside the AK party HQ in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraSupporters of Mr Erdogan light flares as they celebrate the resultSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate in IstanbulA supporter of Mr Erdogan carries his portrait in front of a Turkish flagFollowing the election, a shipowner reads a newspaper that covers the resultSupporters of Muharrem Ince, defeated opposition candidate, wait outside the Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP) headquarters following Mr Erdogan\u0027s claim of victoryPeople in an Instanbul barber shop listen to Muharrem Ince\u0027s speech following the resultsSupporters of the pro-Kurdish People\u0027s Democratic Party (HDP) hold photos of its leader Selahatin DemirtasSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate outside the AK party HQ in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraSupporters of Mr Erdogan light flares as they celebrate the result“The documents we’ve presented are quite solid and based on concrete evidence, which cannot be disputed,” said Erdogan.“We sincerely believe there was organised corruption and irregularities.”\u0026nbspImamoglu, the Republican People’s Party (CHP) candidate, however, denounced the decision as politically motivated and highlighted alleged discrepancies in the government’s own claims.Turkey officials order redo of Istanbul vote voiding opposition winEven though his full address never made it to mainstream channels, social media experts claim that such a dismissive approach by the government, combined with Imamoglu’s tech savvy methods of publicising his message, would boost his popularity\u0026nbspon and offline before the rerun.“Ekrem Imamoglu’s attitude both on the night, and in the aftermath of the March 31 elections, of focusing on facts, created the perception among opposition voters that ‘if he’s speaking, he must know what he’s speaking about’,” says Can Selcuki, general manager of Istanbul Economics\u0026nbspresearch firm.Erdogan\u0027s party challenges results of Istanbul electionIt was not the first time the young politician had garnered such large online crowds.On election night in March, the opposition politician used his Twitter account as a private news channel and aired 11 live press briefings after the semi-official Anadolu Agency cut its coverage, lapsing into silence for nearly 12 hours at a pivotal point in the contest.The number of Imamoglu’s followers, now\u0026nbsp2.3 million, reached 869,000 from 382,000 overnight. His live feeds were viewed over 449,000 times by the time of the decision on a rerun, according to Medyascope, an online news outlet. The same night, his name was the third top Twitter trend worldwide.Istanbul’s mayoral election re-run will only make Erdogan weakerAn average post by the young leader receives an audience of around two million, public online data shows.The soft-spoken politician’s motto, #HerseyCokGuzelOlacak, “Everything will be fine,” has struck a chord, inspiring numerous impartial voices in Turkey’s halls of finance, arts and sports to come out in support of Imamoglu before the rerun.President Erdogan expressed his disdain for sports fans who chanted Imamoglu’s slogan at stadiums last week as he attended a Ramadan dinner in Istanbul on Sunday.“It was us who built these stadiums,” he said. “We cannot accept this.”The new vote in Istanbul is as much about the leader’s seemingly threatening undertone, compared to Imamoglu’s embracing talk, as it is about the future of Erdogan’s current government, political analysts argue.CHP hold Turkish flags in front of the party’s\u0026nbspheadquarters (EPA)Once a name unknown to the majority in Turkey, Imamoglu has used social media\u0026nbspto introduce himself and spread his word, often airing scenes from his daily life – shopping in the local market, dining with his family, visiting community centres. By broadcasting the seemingly mundane, he has successfully engaged the internet generation.In three short months, he came to be referred to as the “rising star” of Turkish politics.For two weeks during his short-lived appointment as mayor, he made a historical move to broadcast Istanbul municipality assembly meetings live on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, keeping his promise of continued transparency. Sure enough, the public took note.Imamoglu’s\u0026nbsplive feeds and information flow on social media make a difference in terms of transparency and credibility as you cannot manipulate anyone if they have first-hand access to informationEven on a Wednesday morning when most people would be busy at work or otherwise occupied with daily life, a live broadcast during which ruling party members rejected a drug prevention commission saw a record number of more than 1.5 million viewers.Shorter clips of the vote circulated even more, perhaps helped by the many puzzled reactions as to why a religiously conservative party would oppose an anti-drug initiative.Some argued it was the governing party’s strategy to avenge the unexpected win of the opposition by blocking the new mayor’s moves, while its supporters argued such a commission should not be part of the municipality remit.Imamoglu, the original architect of this open debate, has vowed to continue the dialogue among polarised political groups under absolute online transparency.Such a digital strategy had long been brewing when Imamoglu’s Republican People’s Party, the CHP, and other opposition groups were widely denied exposure in Turkey’s mainstream, pro-government media.Do you need social media followers to get a book deal?A study by an online ersity platform showed that in 2017, before a critical referendum, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan appeared on national TV channels for 53 hours compared to the 17 hours of the CHP leader and the 33 minutes of the pro-Kurdish\u0026nbspPeople’s Democracy Party.Freedom of expression has slumped in recent years more than 150 journalists have been jailed, most since the failed coup of 2016. Recently, the Paris-based Reporters Without Borders ranked Turkey 157th out of 179 in their 2019 World Press Freedom Index.Imamoglu, as well as other opposition candidates, took to Facebook, Twitter and YouTube\u0026nbspto reach over 57 million voters and connect with their constituencies – because there was no other realistic alternative.“Social media makes a jump at times when the mainstream media fails to serve its purpose – it’s as clear as that,” says Tirse Erbaysal Filibeli, head of Istanbul Bahcesehir University’s New\u0026nbspMedia department.Recep Tayyip Erdogan addresses supporters at a rally in Antalya in March\u0026nbsp(AP)“Imamoglu’s live feeds and information flow on social media make a difference in terms of transparency and credibility as you cannot manipulate anyone if they have first-hand access to information.”Although the number\u0026nbspof interactions appears remarkable in a media landscape where opposition figures would otherwise have no exposure, digital analysts nonetheless warn against over-interpreting social media’s impact on changing people’s beliefs or behaviour.Imamoglu\u0026nbspsucceeded not because he better utilised social media.\u0026nbspHis success came as a reflection of the reaction he caused in offline politics, because he was a better politician than previous candidatesYet in a young population such as Turkey, the 90.7 per cent internet access among 16 to 24-year-olds, as registered by the Turkish Statistics Institute in 2018, remains an attractive prospect for all political actors, as well as international media outlets.\u0026nbspIn late April, the BBC, Deutsche Welle, France24 and Voice of America – all taxpayer-funded or state-subsidised services in their respective countries – pioneered a joint news channel on YouTube, called +90, targeting Turkish speaking audiences worldwide.The shared platform, named after the international dialling code for Turkey, was “forward looking to the future of the media”, said Peter Limbourg, director general of Deutsche Welle, the driving force behind the initiative, speaking at a press conference in Istanbul.“If you look at the sheer amount of Turkish language on Twitter, YouTube, not to even mention Facebook accounts, obviously Turks are very exciting they know what’s going on,” added Gallagher Fenwick, the head of France24 English.Turkish journalist from opposition newspaper beaten up in street“So, obviously, this is an extremely exciting market for that reason.”But even in the most vibrant internet environment, well-budgeted and coordinated digital campaigns are still doomed to fail unless supported by strong politics and politicians with convincing messages, experts argue.“Imamoglu succeeded not because he better utilised social media,” says Akin Unver, professor of international relations at Istanbul’s Kadir Has University.“His success came as a reflection of the reaction he caused in offline politics, because he was a better politician than previous candidates.”Now, CHP’s Imamoglu and his team are set for another challenge – but this time they have an established base of millions of supporters, flamed by a profound sense of injustice, say campaign organisers.“Since the news on a rerun, people from almost all parts of society have pursued a ‘digital initiative’ putting forward some kind of personal political campaign. Thus, there is no longer an organised campaign in place but an organic one,” says Cagri Isiklioglu, one of the leaders in the nationwide social media campaign for the CHP.“At this point the most important thing is to ensure the security of the ballot boxes on 23 June.”Imamoglu won’t get things his own way, however, even online. Instagram has become a leading news outlet, with the opposition star attracting over 4 million followers on the social media tool.Imamoglu\u0026nbsphas mobilised offline\u0026nbspsupport as effectively as online\u0026nbsp(AP)But President Erdogan, who admittedly has been a political figure for over three decades, has 5.4 million followers on the platform. Then again, his candidate for the Istanbul mayoralty is at only 337,000.With the race back on to determine the next administration of one of Europe’s largest cities, with a budget of $4bn, online platforms are taking pole position insofar as Imamoglu’s ability to engage with voters is concerned.“From now on, online platforms will surely play a greater role in politics because we have entered into a new period of transparency,” Selcuki says.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Keir resigned as a consultant to the academy when he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet.”A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But we must try to find a balance.The royals have long-established traditions and do not like change.But given how intense le is for new parents, who can blame Meghan and Harry for wanting to enjoy it alone for a bit Most women avoid cameras for weeks after giving birth. So having a photo taken, under pressure to look gorgeous, scrutinised from every angle, just a couple of days after giving birth  That is a huge ask.I didn’t get out of my pyjamas for a week both times after I had children.Harry and Meghan did a fantastic job introducing Archie to the world.I loved how Harry carried his baby in, already the hands-on father he wants to be, alight with the joy of new fatherhood.However, it was impossible not to think about how wonderful Diana would have been as a grandmother.The birth of a son must be bittersweet for Harry, knowing Diana will never meet Archie.While some grumbled about the two-day wait to show off the baby, others recommend a “babymoon” for parents to shut out the rest of the world and bond with their baby for a week or two.Something tells me that would have been Meghan and Harry’s preference, so this was a compromise.They understand they are public figures.Archie is seventh in line to the throne and his parents know that taxpayers, who in part pay their salary, expected to meet the baby at some point.Most of us only wish to send our love, wish the new parents well and share the moment with them.Within hours of the birth, Meghan’s half-sister had suggested the new arrival meant Meghan was morally obliged to reconnect with her father, Thomas Markle.Let’s be clear. Meghan doesn’t have to do any such thing.She is better off without a father she can’t trust.If your own family are not up to scratch, you make your own based on love, trust and happiness.Given how happy Meghan and Harry look with Archie, they are doing just fine with that.A couple of things really stood out for me about the way they introduced their baby to the world.First, didn’t Meghan look amazing in her Grace Wales Bonner-designed dress I love the fact she chose white, which clearly showed her post-baby bump.She knows what a role model is.And she knows better than to create unrealistic aspirations for women who have just given birth.After all, most mothers still have the bump for at least a few weeks after having a baby.Then there was the look of sheer happiness on the Queen’s face as she looked down at her new great-grandson.Even with her many children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, she radiated a delight she shares with grandmothers up and down the land.It was just beautul to behold.MAMMA mia! Looking at the cover of Sports Illustrated’s annual swimsuit issue – featuring model and entrepreneur Tyra Banks – it’s impossible to believe Tyra’s first cover was  years ago and she came out of “modelling retirement” for the shoot.The very idea of wearing a yellow string bikini – at any age, let alone  – is unimaginable to most of us mere mortals.Butyou’ve got it, flaunt it . . . and Tyra certainly still has it.I AM increasingly convinced the only way to grow old gracefully is simply to accept that it’s happening.So I feel bad for Katie Price, who at  had another facelt last month in Turkey.On Wednesday’s Good Morning Britain, the ex-model discussed her “addiction” to plastic surgery.She explained how she had her own fat injected under her eyes and had the side of her face “lted” in a bid to look more youthful.It sounds horric. Choosing to have serious surgery to look a bit younger is baffling.Maybe she feels defined by her looks and will do anything to hang on to them.When I look at pictures of Katie or watch her on TV, I wish she would be kinder to herself and love herself more.She should worry more about how she feels than how she looks.She needs a best friend – someone who knows everything about her and still loves her – to tell her to stop scratching the wrong itch.Katie should give up the plastic surgery and learn to love herself the way she are . . . wrinkles and all.NOT sure I’ll be taking up Lisa Snowdon’s tip for keeping an eye on how much she eats – using chopsticks for every meal instead of a kne and fork.The TV presenter, , says they slow down her eating, so she feels full more quickly.But whatyou are having soup I HAD a chuckle about the fact that Gregg Wallace’s favoured comment on his we Anne-Marie’s Instagram account is the suggestion that she print out a photo.Someone has compiled a mega-tweet of the many times he has commented on his -year-old partner’s photos, demanding she “print it”.When it comes to social media, that sort of defeats the object.Gregg, I feel for you. It’s hard getting older – and it sucks not understanding the modern way of doing things.WHEN Donald Trump refused to publish his tax s, I assumed it was because he didn’t want people to know how much money he had.It turns out it was because he had so little.His tax s reveal he “lost more money than almost any other American taxpayer for a decade, after his hotels and casinos racked up .BILLION dollars in losses”.So not quite the billionaire he claims he is . . .  or the ace businessman.PERHAPS the most surprising news of this week is that although more alcohol is now being drunk around the world, we Brits are not responsible for the rise.We call them snowflakes but, very often, the young people I meet are much more focused and impressive than my generation ever was.APPARENTLY it’s not just booze we Brits are giving up. Thanks to technology, we are now having less SEX than ever before, too.A major study found there has been a steep decline in rates of intimacy since , with fewer than half of Britons now having sex once a week.Scientists said that “le in the digital age” was partly to blame – with couples now too distracted by Netflix, social media or their phones to focus on each other.But seriously,you prefer Netflix or your phone to sex with your partner... well, it’s time for a orce, I’d say.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sector bosses will call on Whitehall ministries, major companies and huge infrastructure projects to purchase UK-made metals for multimillion-pound schemes. They want them to sign a new charter aimed at maximising the amount of UK-produced steel used in construction ventures. The Government is expected to purchase £.billion worth of steel in the next five years for rail, roads, schools, hospitals and warships.  UK Steel wants as much as possible to be sourced from our shores, with bodies signing up to its charter. Speaking ahead of a launch event in Parliament next week, UK Steel director Gareth Stace said: “This initiative will encourage as many organisations as possible to take a more proactive and thoughtful approach to their procurement of steel in the future, and importantly publicise the exemplar approach that many organisations are already taking.” Community steelworkersapos union general secretary Roy Rickhuss said: “This is an important initiative and a welcome step forward to support our steel industry. Steel unions have long-campaigned for government at all levels to maximise the procurement opportunities for UK steel producers. I hope that the charter will be widely used and adopted and the positive examples of good procurement practice are followed.  Procurement remains a vitally important part of any joined-up industrial strategy, and, along with tackling issues such as industrial energy costs, must be part of any sector deal. What is needed now is the political will to make procurement work for our industry – the steel charter sets out how this can be achieved.” The charter was backed by British Steel, the country’s second-biggest producer, which is locked in talks with ministers about a lesaving Government loan. Chief executive Gerald Reichmann said: “This initiative can help increase the amount of high-quality steel manufactured in Britain going into thousands of domestic construction projects, something which will have a positive impact on the supply chain and wider UK economy. “We encourage as many signatories as possible to sign the charter while informing all parties within the UK supply chain of this new approach which builds on the existing government procurement policy notice.” The charter is a boost for the Mirror’s Save Our Steel campaign, waged amid thousands of job losses and plant closures in .    Earlier, Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt dropped the biggest hint yet yesterday that a UK shipyard will win a £billion deal for new Royal Navy support ships. Unions welcomed the signal, which fuelled hopes the Government will back British workers by awarding the bumper contract to a UK consortium. Speaking at the Royal United Services Institute think tank, the Cabinet Minister said: “It’s long order books and steady drum beats in our yards that strengthen our supply chain and bring down the overall cost of procurement.  “What’s needed is a closer partnership with industry that gives them the confidence to invest and build, and us the confidence that we can and we must buy British.”The Ministry of Defence is under pressure to pledge to build two, possibly three, Fleet Solid Support ships in Britain. The vital vessels will resupply warships, including the Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier, with ammunition, explosives and food. Ms Mordaunt, a Royal Navy reservist who spoke about watching the Falklands War naval task force leave Portsmouth when she was nine-years-old, dubbed them “our logistic backbone”. The deal has been put out to international tender and five firms, including one UK consortium, are in the running.  A decision is due next year and unions have launched the Keep Britain Afloat campaign to demand the contract stays in Britain. Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions general secretary Ian Waddell said: “The new Secretary of State is at a crossroads which will decide whether she spends her time in office dealing with redundancies and closure or delivering the Navy of the future. “We welcome any change of heart that recognises the importance of maintaining the UK’s ability to design, build and maintain naval ships at home. “Shipyard workers across the country have been campaigning hard, as part of the Keep Britain Afloat campaign, to ensure that these ships are built in Britain because shipbuilding offers le chances for young people, supports communities, maintains highly-skilled technical and service jobs and keeps taxpayer investment in the UK.

Brexit deal for Trade Secretary Liam Fox warned rebel MPs that failing to deliver a Brexit deal would leave the UK facing a choice of No Deal or stopping Brexit completely - and that MPs should consider the consequences.But MPs were resisting pressure to support the PM’s plan - with Labour insisting they would not do so unless there were concessions.A senior Labour spokesman raised alarm among some of his own MPs by refusing six times to rule out speculation the party could abstain on the bill at second reading, which could be enough for it to pass.But Labour sources later played down the chances of Jeremy Corbyn doing anything other than ordering his MPs to vote against it. Nigel Dodds of the hardline DUP said it was “highly likely” the deal would be defeated again unless the PM could “demonstrate something new” that addressed the problem of the controversial Irish border backstop.And Tory Brexiteer Peter Bone called on the PM to quit before next week’s European elections as he read out a letter from his local Conservatives at PMQs . Remain-backing Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs said they would vote down any agreement unless it had a referendum attached, while the SNP has said their  MPs would oppose.The PM’s husband, Philip May, was phone canvassing at Tory HQ ahead of next week’s European elections on Tuesday night. Yet Tory party chairman Brandon Lewis has told candidates they stand no chance of winning a seat unless they are already an MEP, signalling Tory fears of a wipe-out.

Call handlers in Wolverhampton and Walsall will strike on May - in protest at workloads and staff shortages. It is the second walkout in three months from the workers - who want , new staff, permanent contracts and limits on the number of phone calls per manager. Yet hours before it was announced, a leaked DWP memo revealed chiefs plan to bust myths about the benefit with an advertising campaign - at a major cost to taxpayers. The PCS union, which represents the workers, accused the DWP of trying to cover up the very failures its strike is focused on.General Secretary Mark Serwotka said: “Instead of trying to solve this ongoing dispute over workloads and recruitment, Ministers are spending thousands on a propaganda campaign to promote a failed Universal Credit system.   “It is shameful that the minds of minsters are not focused on claimants or staff but instead on covering up for their own abject failures. “This strike will send a message that we as a union will not stand idly by while our members are treated with contempt and ministers run Universal Credit into the ground.”Details of the leaked DWP memo first emerged in acolumn and it has since been veried by the Mirror.Ministers have repeatedly had to make changes to Universal Credit over payment delays and flaws that were driving hard-up claimants to food banks. Yet the memo, signed by three top civil servants including UC Director General Neil Couling, focuses on negativity and scaremongering that discourages people from accessing help.    The memo reveals chiefs have planned a regular feature in thenewspaper lasting more than nine weeks to “myth-bust the common inaccuracies reported on UC”. It is due to launch this month with a full front page advert and four-page advertorial to explain what UC is and how it works in reality and follow a day in the le of a work coach, the memo said. The memo said “the features won’t look or feel like DWP or UC – you won’t see our branding, and this is deliberate. We want to grab the readers’ attention and make them wonder who has done this ‘UC uncovered’ investigation.” Advertising Standards Authority guidelines say advertisers must make clear that advertorials are marketing communications, for example by heading them aposadvertisement featureapos. The memo added: We hope this provides a timely rebuttal to some of the negativity we see, and it is part of our more confident, front-footed strategy to tackle misconceptions and improve the reputation of UC.    The memo also reveals every MP has been invited to their local Jobcentre, and the DWP is working with BBC on a documentary series that will film inside three Jobcentres. We have just signed a contract with the BBC to allow them to do more extensive filming inside some of our jobcentres around the country, the memo says. It is unclear what this contract entails or whether it is some form of standard-issue contract used when filming. The DWP memo boasts the series will be a fantastic opportunity for us and we’ve been involved in the process from the outset. It adds: We continue working closely with the BBC to ensure a balanced and insightful piece of television. A DWP spokesman refused to comment directly on the memo, but said: It’s important people know about the benefits available to them, and we regularly advertise Universal Credit. “All our advertising abides by the strict guidelines set by the Advertising Standards Authority.” The timing of the strike and the leaked memo within  hours are a coincidence. The decision to stage industrial action - approved in a ballot in February - is not linked to the memo.  PCS members at the two centres were entitled to vote. Of the  who voted, voted to strike.It comes four years since , Universal Credit staff staged a -hour walkout in protest at the oppressive workplace culture. They complained of staff shortages, poor training and at least £m apossquanderedapos on IT that wasnapost used.A DWP spokesman said: We are disappointed that the PCS in Walsall and Wolverhampton has taken this course of action. Planned meetings with the union are ongoing and our priority is ensuring there is no disruption to our customers. Our frontline staff deliver vital support to around  million people across the country and we are committed to supporting them in their roles, including by monitoring staff levels and making sure their caseloads are manageable.

After my diagnosis, I struggled mentally and it had a big impact on how I thought about things. “I’ve had to adjust to the person I am today instead of the person I thought I should be.” Shane’s first symptoms were delayed growth and puberty.“I was so much smaller than my friends and lost a lot of weight,” he said.“I was always the ‘squeaky’ one as my voice didn’t break when everyone ’s did.”In January , he developed further symptoms including eye pain, headaches and fatigue.“I spent a lot of time sleeping – I’d come home from school and go straight to bed,” said Shane.“Although I knew this wasn’t normal, I just adapted to it and it became my normal.” “I had severe headaches every day and they were so unbearable, being asleep was the only time I felt at peace. “Friends stopped inviting me out because I was always too tired or sleeping – then they just stopped asking. “I’d miss family outings and parties because I was wiped out. “Just before my diagnosis, it was my mum’s birthday barbecue and I spent the whole day in bed.” Clare took Shane to AE at their local hospital in May  where an MRI scan revealed   “a growth” on his brain.     They were taken by ambulance to Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham for a more detailed MRI scan, and Shane was told he had a brain tumour.“The doctor, me and my mum were in tears,” he said.Biopsy results revealed that the tumour was a cancerous pineal germinoma , on his pituitary gland, explaining his delayed growth and puberty.It was too deep in his brain to operate and Shane had a gruelling four-week course of radiotherapy.“It wiped out my tumour, but it was tough going,” said Shane.“I was heartbroken when I lost my long hair, which was my pride and joy,” said Shane.“I’d been in a band since I was in year  for years until I was too ill,  and have always fancied myself as bit of a rocker!”said the Bon Jovi fan, who plays guitar on The Brain Tumour Charity’s video sound track.Shane felt like his le was on hold.“It was like I was watching le as an observer, rather than being part of le,” he said.“Struggling to process what had happened to me felt like a battle with my own mind.” Despite Shane’s challenges, he managed to pass most of his GCSEs and re-sat English, before going to college to study music for three years.“Music is my therapy – playing or listening to it makes me go into my own little zone and takes me to my happy place – and gives me belief things will work out.” Shane, now six foot, has scans once a year.“I’m doing well and working full time as a hotel receptionist, which I love, “said Shane. “I still get the odd headache and I’m on hormone replacement medication, but I count my blessings.     “I’ve had brilliant support from my family and becoming a Young Ambassador with The Brain Tumour Charity to help raise awareness is the best thing I’ve ever done. “Talking to other people who ‘get it’ at our meet-ups and in our closed Facebook group really helps. “I took part in the video because I want to help other young people who are struggling after diagnosis as it helped me when I learned to speak out and share my feelings. “No one should feel embarrassed about having mental health issues. Don’t bottle everything up and talk to someone. “From struggling to accept the person I was, I now feel a bit stronger each day – having a brain tumour and overcoming my problems has helped shape the person I am today.” Emma Wood, The Brain Tumour Charity’s Young Adults Services manager, said: “We’re so proud to have Shane as a Young Ambassador and grateful he took part in our video for Mental Health Awareness Week.“Being diagnosed with a brain tumour can have a huge impact on young people’s mental and emotional health. “The shock of diagnosis, treatment and struggling to adjust to the ‘new’ them means they are often facing lots of dferent challenges, which can trigger depression. “By speaking out about his mental health and coping mechanisms, along with the other young people in the video, Shane is helping others know they’re not alone and empowering them to confide in someone.” The Brain Tumour Charity’s Young Adults Service holds regular meet-ups for people aged -.The charity’s HeadSmart campaign raises awareness about children and teenagers’ brain tumour symptoms."},{"url":null,"title":"tory party chief brandon lewis","story":"NewsTory Party Chief Brandon Lewis tells MEP candidates they will not get electedAfter losing , councillors and sinking to fth place in some polls - this is probably the last thing Conservative candidates wanted to hearShareCommentsByOliver MilnePolitical Correspondent:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY News \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt is not a great time to be a Conservative party candidate for the European Parliament.Senior members of your party are basically saying the party need to do a cross-over episode with Nigel Farage or youaposll get ganked .

Carl Beech, , was found with indecent images of young boys on aposa number of media devicesapos, Newcastle crown court was told. He secretly filmed a boy, and tried to blame his own son when hidden footage was found by police, said Tony Badenoch QC, prosecuting. Beech, who became known as aposNickapos, was said to have made a fraudulent criminal injuries claim of £, for abuse by Jimmy Savile. He used it for a £, cash deposit on his £, white Ford Mustang convertible, the jury heard. Ex-NHS inspector Beech allegedly made a series of aposincredible and untrueapos allegations of abuse and child homicide by MPs, military and secret services. The aposringapos was said to include politicians Ted Heath, Leon Brittan, Harvey Proctor, and Field Marshal Lord Bramall, former head of the armed services.  Northumbria Police were brought in to investigate Beechaposs claims, made to Met Police and described as aposcredible and trueapos by them in , and seized electronic media devices from his Gloucester home during a search in . Mr Badenoch said: On those devices were found indecent images of young boys, covert images of school boys taken by him, and recordings. The criminal offences of making and possessing indecent images of children and of voyeurism. At the same time as he perpetuated these lies about Harvey Proctor and so many others, he was also viewing indecent images of the gravest kind and spying on small boys.

PC Amy Macaulay, , was knocked down by the Nissan Juke Acenta as it reversed during the incident in Ipswich. Her ankle was saved by her sturdy police boot but she was left in agony with her leg trapped under the front wheel before the driver, James Turner, , sped away. Incredibly she managed to get up and hobbled back to her colleague in a police car so they could chase after Turner.  PC Macaulay was left with serious bruising to the bones of her lower leg and foot, and needed a month off work to recover. Doctors told her that she could easily have broken her ankle and been left permanently disabledit were not for the protection of her police issue boot. Turneraposs car was found smashed up and abandoned minutes later and he was arrested the next day.    He admitted four charges of aggravated vehicle taking, three of driving while disqualied and assault causing actual bodily harm. Turner was jailed for two years at Ipswich Crown Court and banned from driving for four years soon after PC Macaulay ed to duty. The horric incident happened on March  after she and her colleague tried to stop the Nissan which was believed to have  or stolen number plates. After receiving information to suggest a car was being driven on  or stolen plates, we found the vehicle in London Road and pulled alongside to see a single middle-aged male occupant, PC Macaulay said.    He didnapost give us much cause for concern, so we pulled in front and my colleague stayed in the car. I banged on the bonnet as I ran round to the driveraposs side, so he knew I was there. When I opened the door, he looked at me but didnapost speak. His body language didnapost give me any cause for concern. Then he suddenly drove forward and collided with the police car. My colleague was quick to block his way, which, in hindsight, stopped me being more injured. Turner then slammed his car into reverse, dragging PC Macaulay backwards until she fell under the front wheel. He then drove back into the police car and reversed again - crushing her right leg and driving over her feet.    He ripped off the front end of his car as he turned around and drove away on the wrong side of the road, leaving the wreckage behind him. I had a bump to the head, and the side of my face started to bruise. I had a hip injury, whiplash and grazing to my arm, PC Macaulay continued. Miraculously, my leg wasnapost broken but there was bruising on the bone. There is no doubt that, without my boots, I would have very little ankle left. Itaposs hard to describe, but every part of me ached.    When I fell under the car, I was trapped with the wheel on my leg. I remember looking up and pleading with him to stop. I thought,he carried on, I wasnapost going to make it out of there. In interview, he made little comment but to apologise and say he was just trying to get away. It was quite a deliberate act. Itaposs not often people try to hurt you. Itaposs been hard to come to terms with because I questionedIaposd done something wrong, but looking back, I know I didnapost.    Superintendent Matt Rose, head of specialist operations for Suffolk Police, said: Our officers are prepared to put themselves in danger, every day, to keep the county safe. Anyone willing to attack them has no respect for the law, and no thought for anyone . This driver recklessly decided to make a getaway with no thought for the safety of others. Amy was very fortunate to be left with only bruises after being knocked to the ground and having her foot driven over.

Monger, , pleaded guilty to possessing an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear or violence and six counts of possessing a prohibited weapon.    He was jailed by judge Timothy Rose for four years and six months. The terror unfolded at .pm last November. Minutes before the raid, two school pupils, aged , were barged into by a man wearing a black and red mask along a nearby alley. He reportedly drew a replica rle on the terried girls. Gemma Isaac, the mum of one of the girls, said: The man had his hand over his face and he barged into my daughter. They saw he was wearing a black mask with holes in it and red stripes. He had a large bag with him and a camping bag. He pulled a rle on them. They started to run all the way back home, terried. They were so scared. After the altercation in the alley, the man then entered the supermarket. A National Police Air Servicewas deployed to the incident and police units took on the detainment of the man from store security.

Royal expert Katie Nicholl told Grazia that the staff they do have - who work in their office at Buckingham Palace - is a scaled down team.But there is one person who has been on hand to help out in the first few days of little Archieaposs le - Meghanaposs mum Doria Ragland. The yoga instructor, who lives in LA, arrived in the UK shortly before the birth and is believed to still be staying at Frogmore with her new grandson.    A source told Katie that Doriaaposs help has been indispensable to Meghan and Harry. Itaposs not a huge change for Meghan and Harry, and according to pals the couple didnapost have any staff at their old home in Kensington Palace.The pals, who gave an anonymous interview to People magazine to defend Meghan against global bullying , described the two-bedroom cottage as small and cozy. They also said that the Duchess cooks for them every single day, and that she also does her own hair and make-up. One friend told the magazine: People think when you come out of the car that you went through some metaphorical reverse car wash. Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo, and everyone’s doing all this stuff to you.

Kelly Knipes, , says she regularly woke up in the mornings to find email receipts for items she unconsciously bought online during the night. One day a delivery lorry even turned up outside her home containing a full-sized plastic basketball court she didnapost realise she had bought. Other strange items she has purchased while apossleep shoppingapos include hundreds of pounds worth of Haribo sweets and £ worth of cookie jars. She then had toall the items bought on websites via her smart phone which contained her credit card details in order to avoid going into debt. Her nocturnal shopping behaviour started seven years ago, after the birth of her first child, when was found to suffer from a condition called parasomnia.    She thinks the disorder was sparked by her sleep apnea - where she stops breathing in her sleep. This forces her brain to partially wake and makes her sleepwalk and sleep shop. Kelly said: I bought a full size basketball court from Ebay, and when it turned up at my house the next day, I just refused delivery. I would never actually have to put any credit card details when when I was buying things online because it was all saved on my phone. It was all on my phone and everything that is on my phone is accessible by touch. I was racking up debt everywhere. Kelly, from Basildon, Essex, was known to occasionally sleepwalk as a child but her condition worsened following the birth of her first child Henry in .    She added: When I was  weeks pregnant, I took an overdose in my sleep. Because I am diabetic I have to take medicine for it and I overdosed on the metformin. I was having a dream that I was speaking to the doctors and I kept saying that I didnapost want to take the medicine anymore - but when I woke up I had taken all the tablets. Luckily everything was OK - but I was so worried that social services would get involved. At the time she lived in a ground floor flat and she would wake to find doors and windows open after sheaposd been up in the night. She didnapost seek help as she feared doctors may question her abilities as a single mum to her son, Henry. But after marrying husband Jamie, , who is deaf, and the birth of their sons Joey and Carson, now four and three, things escalated. Kelly said: It was horrible, because I didnapost know what I was going to do in the night.    I was physically exhausted, I felt so drained every day of my le. I didnapost do anything with my kids, I was constantly in hospital because I wasnapost sleeping at night. Every other parent was taking their kids out - my kids thought the hospital was their version of the day out. I didnapost feel like I could be a mum or a we. I was piling on the weight because I was eating to try and get my sugar levels up. It was awful. Kelly went to her GP on numerous occasions but was repeatedly told her symptoms were down to her being tired and stressed. She added: Because I have three disabled children, everyone just kept putting it down to the stress of looking after my children.    It was only when she wrote directly to two consultants pleading for help that one took on her case. Dr Samuel suggested a trial of a continuous positive airway pressuredevice to keep the airway open and the results have been remarkable. Kelly said that Dr Samuel could prove that she had stopped breathing  times when she was sleeping and diagnosed her with obstructive sleep apnea and parasomnia. Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when your throat muscles intermittently relax and block your airway during sleep. She now wears an oxygen mask at night which helps to regulate her breathing which has managed to control both diagnoses. She continued: When I had the CPAP machine I felt rested and re-energized for the first time in ages. It really has given me my le back.Since starting CPAP, I have not had any abnormal sleep behaviours, have not shopped online at night, my headaches have ceased and I am not depressed.If it wasnapost for Dr Samuel, I donapost know where I would be.    The help comes after years of searching for a solution including taking part in a sleep study at Royal Brompton Hospital. Dr Samuel said: I am delighted that patients such as Kelly can signicantly benefit from the treatment we offer in the sleep and ventilation service. It is great to see Basildon Hospital making such a dference in the lives of families. Kelly added: All my children have been severely ill at some point in their le and Basildon Hospital has saved them on many occasions, I owe them so much. I just want to raise awareness for it because it is not really spoken about, sleeping walking in adults. Kelly previously worked as an administrator for a mental health unit but has since had to stop to care for her children.

Neil Pearce, , was repeatedly kned in the body, neck and head until the blade broke by drunk thug Jake Bartholomew-Mann, , in a sustained and vicious attack. He then launched Neil off his wheelchair and began kicking him over and over again before casually walking away from the scene. Neil was rushed to Northern General Hospital where he underwent an emergency le-saving operation. He then had reconstructive surgery which involved screwing six metal plates into his facial bones.    Neil, who lost the use of his legs in a  car crash, spent the next two weeks in intensive care fighting for his le and is lucky to be alive. Sickening photos show Neil battered and bloodied following the brutal attack on New Yearaposs Day at around pm while he was at home with his partner and -week old baby. Neil, who describes Bartholomew-Mann as a friend of a friend, says he has no idea why he carried out the savage attack. Bartholomew-Mann was sentenced to  years behind bars earlier this month after pleading guilty to grievous bodily harm at Sheffield Crown Court. Neil said he had known Bartholomew-Mann for about seven years and had met him many times before the attack was carried out.  The drama unfolded when Neil heard a noise outside his home in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, and went to check everything was okay. Neil was in the side alley next to his ground floor flat on January  when Bartholomew-Mann appeared and began stabbing him in his neck, arms, legs, body and head. His partner Emily Mitchell, , watched on in horror from inside the property and locked the door to prevent the crazed attacker getting inside. After Bartholomew-Mann fled the area, Emily ran out to help her partner and an ambulance was called.    Neil said: I just remember suddenly seeing him and then getting stabbed over and over again. I was in complete shock and couldnapost believe what was happening. As he was stabbing me he was saying he was going to cut my -week old babyaposs head off. All that was going through my head was aposI need to protect my familyapos. I was fighting back trying to stop him getting into the house, it all felt like a letime. Then he launched me off my chair and on to the floor and started caving my head in.  After that, he just walked out casually and closed the gate behind him leaving me for dead. I donapost understand why he attacked me, Iaposm disabled and in a wheelchair, Iaposm defenceless. I want to go and see him in prison to find out why he did it because I havenapost got a clue. Neil spent two weeks in intensive care and five weeks in hospital overall before ing home.  He has praised medical staff for saving his le. Neil says the ordeal has traumatised him and that he now has flashbacks to New Yearaposs Day. He said: The attack has obviously had a massive impact on me.    I still suffer mentally and physically as a result of it. But all I can do it keep on going and focus on the future. Iaposm lucky to be alive.

On October  last year an unnamed -year-old grabbed Jamal Hijazi round the neck on the field of Almondbury Community School in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. A video that would later go viral appears to show the teenage aggressor choking the -year-old, squirting a bottle of water in his face and saying: “Ya little bas****. I’ll drown ya.” After the video emerged, the founder of the English Defence League, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, made accusations that Jamal attacked English schoolgirls. Now the youngster has filed a libel claim in the High Court against Robinson, according to . He told the newspaper: He has broken the law and I hope they [the courts] agree with us. When he put those posts up he was giving people the wrong idea about me and I was really worried because people were thinking: aposJamal is not a good person.apos After he posted the video we were very scared and we got lots of threats from people because of what he said about me hitting those girls - I had never even spoken to these girls but people in the area started threatening us.  Jamal is being represented by lawyer Tasnime Akunjee - who also worked with Shamima Begumaposs family. Mr Akunjee said they were lodging Jamalaposs claim for damages against Yaxley-Lennon today concerning aposdefamatory commentsapos. In the months after the attacker was interviewed and defended by Robinson, Jamalaposs father Jihad set up four CCTV cameras around the new family home and stayed up for days watching the feed, fearing that some of the threats they had received would be acted upon. The -year-old would later move his family out of Huddersfield.  The shocking footage which emerged showed Jamal being shoved to the ground on playing fields at Almondbury Community School. The harrowing footage was shared widely on social media, including Facebook, and led to a police investigation. But Robinson then made a number of claims in a series of rants online about Jamal. He said the youngster was not innocent and had been involved in terrorising other classmates. In one video, he said: He violently attacked young English girls in his school. Why is this kid being portrayed as the ultimate victim in the entire country   He added: He’s not innocent and he violently attacks young English girls at school. He beat the s*** out of an English kid. This was accompanied by a screenshot of a message from a mum claiming her daughter had been bullied. But the same mum later posted on Robinsonaposs page that the boy in the video was not the culprit. Robinson later said he had been aposhadapos, saying: I have been completely had, how embarrassing, man. The former EDL leader was permanently booted off Facebook and Instagram . Facebook said he was posting in ways that violate our policies about organised hate. Despite the comments made by Robinson, people around the country rallied in support of Jamal and his relatives, who had left their home in the war-torn city of Homs in Syria in . In March Jamalaposs attacker was issued with a caution relating to a section  assault offence. And Facebook deleted several of Robinson’s videos for violating its community standards, reports said. In a separate matter, High Court judges this week have given the go-ahead for fresh proceedings to be brought against Robinson over an allegation he committed contempt of court. Robinson faces an allegation he committed contempt by filming people in a criminal trial and broadcasting footage on social media.

Razan, , fled to Britain with her family seven years ago after her husband had a lucky escape from a car bomb under his office in Damascus. Her host is third-generation ­fisherman Bob Roberts, . He is a committed Brexiteer who thinks ­immigration should be controlled. We have asked Bob and Razan to meet today as part of Britain Talks, a pioneering project that asks people with erging views to spend time together, find common ground and discover the real people behind the politics. The two are soon sharing their views on everything from business rates to Brexit , immigration and the unpredictable Yorkshire weather . Will they find, in the words of the late Labour MP Jo Cox, that they have far more in common than that which ides them Razan travels to Scarborough, on the picturesque but sometimes neglected North Yorkshire coast, to see where Bob lives and works. She heads to the bustling south harbour, from where Bob heads out at dawn each day in his distinctive red, blue and black boat, Capernaum, with a small crew to catch  lobsters and the odd crab. Bob sells them to shops and restaurants across the UK – a market that has been dominated by Canadian imports. Today he greets Razan in Arabic – learnt from time spent working in Iraq when he was younger – before passing her a le jacket and inviting her on board.  He tells her: “We’re in a bubble here in Scarborough – we don’t have much foreign labour. People have a duty to integrate. I worry about people who are radicalised coming here. “You see photographs of Damascus and Aleppo and think how the hell are people living there. “Once it’s stable I think there should be an ambition that theyand rebuild their own country.” Former Royal Navy submariner Bob is a committed Brexiteer who thinks Britain should leave the European Union as quickly as possible. He sees Brexit as essential to the future of his ailing industry. As they head out of the harbour, he explains the relationship between Britain’s fishing industry and the EU, which Razan had not been aware of before.  They make an unlikely pair – she in her white headscarf, snapping pictures of the horizon on her smartphone, and Bob in wellies and waterproofs, steering them expertly through the water. Showing Razan where he bags his famous Yorkshire lobsters, Bob tells her: “I voted for Brexit to end the Common Fisheries Policy, and so we can have control over our own waters. “Then we could build our coastal communities back up. As an exporting and maritime nation we should be taking advantage of our own waters.” Razan and husband Raghil arrived in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, in  with their children Angie, , Yara, nine and Kareem, seven, and very little .  Razan, who is Muslim, was still in the process of becoming a British citizen at the time of the Brexit referendum in , so was not able to vote – but she does not want to leave Europe. She says: “I think as a general point it’s better to work together when you can. This feels like a orce and it isn’t being managed very well. It is very messy.” When Razan tells Bob about her food business, the Yorkshire Dama Cheese Company, his eyes light up. The two entrepreneurs quickly realise they share a passion for hard work and a pride in regional Yorkshire produce. Back on dry land the pair head to a local cafe, Lookout On The Pier, for freshly caught fish and chips. Then they walk up the steep, cobbled streets to his cottage, with its “Fishermen for Leave” sticker in the window, to chat more over cups of Yorkshire tea.  Bob will make avisit to her a week later – finding out more about how refugee families like hers are working hard to make a new home, and sharing food and ideas at her kitchen table. Razan founded her cheese company after arriving in the UK and finding she could buy the halloumi that she loved. Now it is a thriving business, scooping top awards and employing local people at its Sowerby Bridge base. For Razan, the business is everything - her livelihood, her children’s future, and a way of creating a new le here. She says: “Being a business has helped me fit in more. I feel very strongly that when you are in a new country you need to give something back, to get involved, that’s how you get settled.” So when Bob visits, his first stop is the production centre in Sowerby Bridge. Razan proudly leads him on a tour of the small factory, explaining why she loves the area’s fresh milk, and her plans for a new deli. Then they head to her terraced home, a short drive away in Huddersfield. In her kitchen they prepare a tantalising buffet of their produce – lobster and halloumi - all made or caught in the last few days.  They are both impressed – Razan says the lobster is “the taste of Scarborough”, and Bob says he is a halloumi convert. A well as enjoying great food, they have loved meeting each other. But have they changed any of their opinions  For Bob, it has been “eye-opening”. He says: “A lot of people have a negative viewpoint about refugees but we need to be open-minded and embrace ­immigration. What’s impressed me is Razan’s ability to integrate and adapt, settling here and making it work.” Spending time with Razan has deepened his understanding of the refugee experience. He adds: “It’s been really special – understanding her plight, and how people overcome their problems. “Immigration enriches a country. But I do believe in controls. It’s all about controlling who comes in. “We’ve come a long way. We’ve got a lot in common and a lot to build on.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman confronts ex demands 6k","story":"NewsWoman confronts ex and demands £k child support after spotting him in workwearRob Atkinson was seen in Tesco by Rebecca Desmond before he jumped into a work van while wearing a high-vis outfitShareCommentsByHelen Le CaplainKelly-Ann Mills:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video supposedly-unemployed-dad-owes-k-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA dad accused of owing £, in child maintenance has been confronted by his angry ex, who tracked him down in Tesco Express. Rebecca Desmond said her ex Rob Atkinson claimed to be unemployed and was therefore unable to pay up, but she spotted him jumping into a workeraposs van in the middle of the day. The -year-old mum filmed her childaposs father in the Armthorpe branch of Tesco in Doncaster buying a bottle of beer while in a hi-vis jacket. Rebecca whipped her phone out to record Rob as she claims the Child Maintenance Service informed her he owes more than £, in child support. Rob, , denies he claimed to be unemployed and says he aposneeds to ringapos Child Maintenance Service. He said he is self-employed and does not get regular work, just a couple of days work with no set days to who and when and where. Self-employed therapist Rebecca shows Rob wearing a hi-vis yellow jacket and trousers at a self-checkout till buying two bottles of lager.  When Rob realised he is being filmed by self-employed therapist Rebecca, he calls her a ‘weirdo’ before sauntering out of the store to a branded Direct Traffic van. Rob, , denies he claimed to be unemployed and says he aposneeds to ringapos Child Maintenance Service. Rebecca, from Doncaster, said: “The whole thing brings tears to my eyes. “Fair enough donapost see her, don’t pay for her but don’t strut around our local supermarket. “He’s rejected Freya and here’s a high chance she could have bumped into him there, it’s just sick.” Mum-of-one Rebecca added: “The man owes me thousands in unpaid maintenance. I’ve made it my mission to look at every single Direct Traffic van that I pass. It was only going to be a matter of time. “That day I looked at the van as I was driving past and lo and behold who was driving it  Rob Atkinson.      The couple split up ten years ago when Freya was just nine months old and since then Rebecca claims Rob has had little to do with her. Rob, who said he was at work when contacted for comment, said: “I’ve got four children. Every single one of the other mothers are all up to date with all their payments, everything’s up to date, everythingaposs sorted. [Rebecca] is the trouble. I was on my way home [as] I’d done a sht in Armthorpe. It’s crackers this, absolutely crackers. I picked up some beers on my way home from work, what’s wrong with that  It’s absolutely madness, all it is, is I picked two beers up on my way home from work, I had a bit of weekend work, then went home.    Not regular weekend work. I’m on a self-employed basis - they just gave me a couple of days work. I’m not working with them now, there’s no set days to who and when and where I work. I work for myself. I’m getting little bits of work here and there, couple of days here and couple of days there. For me to turn down a day’s work in Armthorpe on the off-chance I might see a daughter who I actually want to see, have you heard what you’re saying  I only left the army three-and-a-half years ago. I had an attachment of earnings until then. For the first  months I didnapost work at all but [the CMS] thought I was still working. I was medically unwell. I’ve not been working what they [the CMS] think I’ve been working. I’ve just put all my tax accounts in, my tax accounts don’t lie. £, is what she must have totted up from how much they work out a year - £ a month [over] three years. I wasn’t claiming benefits or nothing.  What I need to do is I need to ring the CSA.    A DWP spokesman said they could not comment on inidual cases. The spokesman said: “We’re committed to recovering owed child maintenance and recently introduced tougher powers to take people’s assets into account – including property, savings and investments and self-declared income. If someone suspects their ex-partner of avoiding paying child maintenance, they should inform us straight away so we can investigate fully.” Direct Traffic Management Ltd said they could not comment due to aposdata protection legislationapos.

But Aldo stuck by her and when relatives turned out to be incompatible donors, he found out he was – hours after proposing. The operation was a success and the pair are getting married this year. Geraldine, of Leicester, said: “I’d never have asked my fiance to give me his kidney. I was stunned to find we were even a match. “Aldo has saved my le. I can’t wait to spend the rest of my le with him.”  Aldo, also a nurse, said: “Donating my kidney was such a normal thing to do, I didn’t really think about it. “The most ­important thing is she’ll feel better and have a better quality of le. It was the right thing to do.” The pair met in January  while working at a care home, but Aldo soon left the job. Their first date was days after she was diagnosed that May.

She said: “He’d come from work after a -and-a-half-hour sht. “He’d bring food, help me dress, speak to the doctors... He was my superhero.” Early last year Geraldine found out that her family members were not a match. She said: “I felt suicidal. Aldo kept saying: ‘Let me get tested’.”  They went to Portugal to celebrate her birthday and he proposed on an empty beach while on a private boat trip, on July , . That day he also found out he was a match. She said: “He woke me up in tears. I asked: ‘Whatwe break up ’ He said: ‘At least, I’ll have saved your le’.” They had the transplant on February  this year at University of Leicester Hospital and will marry in August.

The actor clambered onto the majestic animal using its ears and trunk for the ITV show My Travels And Other Animals.But his actions have sparked fury with campaigners calling for ITV to scrap the show and delete it from its catch up channels. Born Free chief Howard Jones said: “We can confirm that, with much regret, Martin Clunes is no longer a patron. Born Free has always been opposed to the exploitation of captive wild animals for entertainment and human interactions, including riding elephants.”    The broadcaster has said it was “deeply unfair” and “misrepresentative” to suggest the show endorsed cruelty, as Clunes “made it very clear he had serious concerns about elephants carrying people”. Audrey Gaffney, co-founder of the Ethical Bucket List, which wants to change the way people travel, has revealed the harrowing ways elephants are apostrainedapos to give people rides. She explained: For many tourists travelling to Asia, an elephant ride is on top of their ‘bucket list’. Itaposs easy to get caught up in the vibrant colourful religious festivals in India or the exotic tropical landscapes of the islands of Thailand and Vietnam. In this setting seeing elephants dressed, painted and paraded through the streets or carrying excited groups of tourists on their backs is considered their customary role.    As this view of their role is steeped in religion and tradition it is normally accepted by tourists as commonplace and many believe harmless. However the truth is that these scenes hide a very dark reality for the animals involved. Audrey explains that to be trained in this way, elephants must be captured when they are very young. She said: Capturing the young will normally involve the death of up to four adult elephants that protect the young. Also as a result of crude capture methods, many of the captive young do not survive.  As wild animals elephants don’t naturally parade around festivals or allow people to ride them, to get them to perform requires a cruel painful process for the animal. The animal needs to be conditioned into submission, this process is known as aposthe crushapos or Phajaan, as it literally requires crushing the young elephantaposs spirit. The process will always involve beatings and violence, the elephant will be kept in a box no bigger than themselves or tied between two trees. They are then subjected to systematic beatings, starvation and lack of water. This will continue until the animalaposs spirit is broken or they die.

One of the big things is we reached a point where we understood the play-offs were probably going to be a more realistic route and we have been focusing on that recently.“It means we are excited more than disappointed and that is important because we should be going into these games thinking about what a great opportunity they are for us.“We have some good experience and some very good young players and, with that mix, it’s an exciting time and we are really looking forward to it.”And Connolly is in no doubt that, of all the teams involved in the post-season process, Robbie Neilson’s Tangerines are the ones that have shown most improvement over the second half of the season.“We are a team on the up. We have shown that and, mentally, we’ve come on. There have been a few hoodoo games the lads had before Christmas, when they struggled against certain teams, that we’ve now won in the past couple of months and that’s a big positive.“And we have to be confident and look to enjoy these ties because, when you are like that going into games, that’s when you play well.”On a personal level, Connolly will be giving his all to get to the top flight. He rates the Championship highly but his reason for ing north of the border from Crawley Town was to get another taste of le in the Premiership.“Every player in Scotland wants to play in the Premiership and,you have the opportunity to get there, you have to take it with both hands.“As a football club, we have the opportunity to get back to the Premiership and, while it’s going to be tough, we are excited and happy to be in that position.“We’ve got a very, very good chance to get there and we are all up for it.“Obviously, it’s not going to be easy because the other teams involved want to be playing there next season as well but we feel we have the quality to get through these games successfully.”"},{"url":null,"title":"hugh-jackman-in-glasgow-how-to-get-tickets-without-using-ticketmaster","story":"AS is usually the norm when big acts announce gigs, music fans have been unable to

development","story":"Former Aberdeen captain Russell Anderson is delighted to see his Development School making a dference to the lives of children in the Granite City.Yesterday over  primary two pupils from the St Machar Academy catchment area descended on Riverbank Primary School for a festival of football and sporting activities organised by the Russell Anderson Development School .The foundation was launched by the former Dons skipper, pictured, in  with the aim to promote positive attitudes towards health and fitness as well as increasing the provision of football development within recognised socially deprived areas of the Granite City.RADS work with , pupils across eight primary schools.Speaking at yesterday’s festival of football, Anderson – who played for the Dons from  to  and  to  – was pleased to see the impact the development school has made.The -year-old, who is now Formartine United assistant manager, said: “We’ve grown again from last year and I suppose that shows we’re doing something right.“I think we’re starting to build a really good relationship with the schools.“We’ve been working with some longer than others and I think they see the benefits of what we’re trying to do.“Hopefully the children benefit from what we are trying to do.“I hope the children enjoy the morning because it’s something dferent from their normal Tuesday morning.“We’ve been working with all the children anyway so they probably know what to expect in terms of what the programme delivers.“But it’s a dferent venue and a change of scenery for them.“They were mingling with children from other schools and the whole experience will hopefully be something for them to really enjoy.“We know that they have done over the last few years and hopefully this is the same.”RADS have continued to grow since their launch seven years ago.And Anderson admits at the outset he was unsure of how it would operate and what could be achieved.The former Scotland international, who also played for Sunderland, Plymouth, Burnley and Derby, added: “Possibly the ambition was that it would develop as it has.“But being honest at the start it was a blank piece of paper and we didn’t really know what we were going to do with it or where it was going to go.“When you look at where we are now compared with that first after school session it’s night and day.“A lot of work has gone into it over that period.“But it’s great to see when it all comes together on a day like yesterday.“When you see the kids enjoy themselves you know that’s worthwhile.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"one way to keep tarbert flowing","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTarbert is about to get a new, improved sewer serving the village.Roads, however, will have to be dug up to replace existing underground pipes.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Many visitors also took a seat around the #have-a-go# table to learn more and make their own pompom caterpillar or plant, take up a bit of cross stitch or find out about the art of decoupage – a staple of the immensely popular activity of upcycling, while others took advantage of the opportunity to sit outside the hall enjoying delicious home-made cakes washed down with tea or coffee.Co-organiser Ruth Tott commented: #The idea of the craft day just grew and grew, with one thing leading to another. One of the many fun attractions, our popular ‘scarecrow’ knitter, came about by accident after an old rusty garden chair was donated then renovated with the aid of brightly-coloured spray paint, after which it was simply crying out for a body to sit on it.#Plans are already afoot for next year’s event – surely a must following such a success.Another one of the organisers, Val Whale, added: #We’re holding a post-mortem with the craft group members this week to discuss what worked, what didn’t work, and what we can do better next year.#Many from the community have already pledged their support, showing how crafting is so much more than just a hobby and can help forge friendships as well as passing on what can become a lelong skill.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

But Auchinleck Estate is carving its own niche in tourism. And its history is every bit as fascinating as nearby Dumfries House Estate. You could argue that renowned biographer James Boswell elevates Auchinleck to even greater signicance than its neighbour. The Boswells had been at Auchinleck for  years before the two rival Georgian ‘big hooses’ were built in the s. “The original Auchinleck House, now a ruin, dates from ,” says historian Billy Cooper. “James IV gave Thomas Boswell the land, but the pair of them were to die together at Flodden in . “There’s an even earlier castle on the estate, and we’re hoping to locate a medieval graveyard.” Billy, , from Ochiltree, along with others, has founded a Friends of Boswell group of volunteers. “It’s a gem of a place –unchanged for centuries, and I just love the history of it all,” he says. Retired policeman Billy has been a guide at Culzean Castle and Dumfries House –but Auchinleck Estate excites him even more. “There’s gothic bridges over gorges, there’s a grotto, and there’s lots more to discover. “When Dr Johnson travelled here in , he had hardly seen a tree since Carlisle, and was impressed with planting done at Auchinleck,” said Billy. Rory Boswell, who runs the farm on Auchinleck Estate, is delighted to have the friends’ group on board. He said: “Since childhood, I’ve loved this wild, rustic place. “We’re the Boswells, we live here, we farm here, we’re still here.” Rory, , recounts a story of two old men, in their s, who used to make tea at the spring, when he was just a lad. He said: “There’s clearly health benefits to people enjoying access to the estate.” The friends are helping to restore gardens and walks that can be enjoyed by all. Rory said: “I have a brother in the army, so I’m pleased that groups like Combat Stress are getting involved.” He is rearing magnicent Highland Cattle, and hopes that one day there will be a steak restaurant alongside the very popular Boswell’s Coach House. Volunteer Mari Welsh, from Auchinleck, says she gets a great feeling of health and well-being from being on the rugged estate. She said: “Boswell was a great writer, and we in the friends group believe we are writing new chapters in the story. “We’re gradually improving the paths and the garden, and we hope tomarshes to ponds.” Mari’s brother, Craig Ferguson, has sketched out ideas of what the estate could become, with enhancements. “There’s so much potential here,” he says. “It’s a truly beautul place on our doorstep.” The friends group are launching guided walks of Auchinleck Estate on Sunday, May . These will leave from the car park at Boswell’s Coach House at .am and .pm. No charge will be made, but donations will be welcome, for volunteer work and improvements.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterPrivacy noticeTheScottishDailyRecordFollow

options for revitalising the failing CCTV network.He said: ldquoEffective public CCTV can make a positive contribution to community safety which is primarily the responsibility of the police but one in which the council has an obvious part to play.ldquoHowever, the capability of the system now operating in Border towns has deteriorated.ldquoWhilst there are limited budgeted council funds to invest in the current CCTV system, and whilst there will be advantages in opening up opportunities for communities to participate in the definition of what is needed, any decisions need to be based on

information part of a consultation with area partnerships, community planning partners and the police, fire and rescue, and safer communities board, before bringing forward a final report for consideration by this council.ldquoFurther to this that officers bring a report to the next Council meeting with a consultation plan, including whether outside resources will need to be brought in, the cost of consultation and a timescale for that consultation and final report to be brought to council.There are eight systems, all of which are operated by Police Scotland, in Duns, Eyemouth,

continue until the CCTV cameras are ldquobeyond economic repair.Police Scotland have also confirmed that although they view the CCTV systems as a valuable resource, they will not be providing funding for their maintenance.Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer has thrown his weight behind the motion.He said: ldquoCCTV plays a vital role is helping prevent and solve crime and I find it completely incomprehensible that decisions that impact the safety, health and well-being of our communities can be taken without a full and complete assessment of the consequences.ldquoOnly this week

going to slow down and show respect by passing at a safe enough distance.ldquoWhen drivers start to think of bike riders as sons, daughters, parents, grandparents and not just as bikes then we will all be able to share the road safely.Police Scotlandrsquos recent survey found  percent of people asked were not aware that close passing was a practice resulting in three penalty points.Consisting of over  Scottish men and women the poll showed most were unaware of the consequences of failing to leave a carrsquos width of space when overtaking a cyclist.In the Scottish Borders cycling accidents occur fairly regularly on Borders roads - and there have been fatalities in the past decade.Cyclists in groups have taken to riding two a breast on the road in order to use up the same space as a vehicle forcing the motorists to slow down and wait until it is safe to overtake.This method has not been free of criticism however as motorists often find it dficult to overtake two cyclists safely rather than give one bike more room.A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: ldquoThe Scottish Borders welcomes tens of thousands of cyclists every year who are here to enjoy some of the best on and off-road cycling that Scotland has to offer.ldquoAs well as local cyclists and cycling groups, we fully support Cycling Scotland and Police Scotland in raising awareness of the risks to riders and the penalties for drivers who overtake too closely.\"Belles on Bikes is a Scottish initiative set up for women to cycle together socially.They have  independent groups across Scotland run by volunteers who are passionate about helping women enjoy cycling and feel safe.One member of the Scottish Borders branch is Brenda Mitchell, a senior partner at Cycle Law Scotland, which is based in Peebles.Brenda told us: ldquoClose passing is incredibly dangerous and there is a huge need for the campaign in every region of Scotland.ldquoOne incident springs to mind involving an elderly male who was overtaken by an HGV far too closely catching the cyclist with the backdraft resulting in him crashing and injuring his clavicle.ldquoWith those incidents you have to remember the highway code as a motorist must give as much room to a cyclist as they would a car.ldquoIt is a super initiative as it focusses on educating drivers as cycling in the Borders has become such a popular activity.ldquoHowever, I find the drivers in the Borders more courteous on average, as most leave the acceptable distance when overtaking.ldquoAs cycling is so big in the Borders, many drivers know how it feels to be on both sides of the wheel and take the necessary steps to make cyclists feel safe.ldquoRespecting one another when sharing road space is key as cyclists also have a duty to be courteous towards drivers.With the tenth year of the TweedLove Bike Festival next month, and Tour orsquo the Borders ing for a third year, cycling tourism in the Borders is continuing to grow.Thanks to Border Buses and the Borders Railway becoming accessible for bike users, people from all over Scotland can travel to the Borders for a dayrsquos cycling in a more energy efficient way.Brenda added: ldquoAs people are becoming more aware of global warming issues, they know it is a good idea to cycle shorter distances instead of driving.ldquoHowever, many people are put off getting on their bikes for fear of their safety.ldquoTherefore, I want to congratulate Police Scotland on raising awareness and educating drivers so that they are unlikely to reoffend.\""},{"url":null,"title":"cycle-planned-as-part-of-georges-legacy","story":"SIX months after a fatal accident cut the le short of a popular Melrose student, his family have formed a new

Finally, after what always seems a long wait, the land is alive and the evenings are long.The colours of this time are a big part of the joy. The blossom and explosion of wild flowers really lts my mood and spirit.A big part of this, for me, is the dandelion. Itrsquos a wild flower which decorates almost everywhere at the moment, creating a carpet of yellow which then transforms into white puffballs of flying lsquowishesrsquo.So many people just see this flower as an annoying weed to be mowed away as soon as it rears its head, but I love the way it keeps cheekily popping up in defiance of our attempts to keep nature at bay. Itrsquos one of our native wild flowers and causes no damage like some real invasive plants can, such as rhododendron.And they benefit our wildle so much. Bees and butterflies feed on them and some birds eat the seeds. But the benefits of the dandelion to humans has also long been recognised.A tea-like drink can be made from the roots and leaves or florets. There are dferent recipes, as the whole plant is edible. You can even make dandelion wine.The sap also contains healing properties which help with a range of ailments, especially skin complaints and issues related to digestion. In fact, herbalists will tell you of a range of health benefits attributed to the dandelion, which is packed with antitoxins and vitamins.And, of course, there are many folklore traditions associated with the flower.One I was reminded of this week when introducing the flower to a class of school children was the belief that you will wet the bedyou touch the petals! There is a small truth in this, as eating the leaves may have a diuretic effect.Making a wish and then blowing the parachute-like wisps which carry the seeds is the stuff of my childhood.Make the wish in secret and the wisps will carry it and help make it true. It is said they can also carry thoughts and love to someone you are missing or thinking about.Other uses include finding out how much you are loved, how many children you may have, or how many years you have left!The dandelion can even forecast the weather, as the puffball will close in on itselfit turns dreich. Another name for it is the lsquoshepherdrsquos clockrsquo, because its flower opens soon after sunrise and closes before the sun sets.And so this week I brought some dandelions into classrooms in a school where I am storytelling.Before I introduced the flowers, I gave them a riddle: ldquoA lion that has no roar, with teeth that do not bite, children who fly away, once yellow has turned to white. They eventually got the answer.The name dandelion, it is believed, comes from the French term lsquodent de lionrsquo meaning lionrsquos tooth, a reference to the teeth-shaped leaves.Then we blew the lsquowishesrsquo in the classroom. I was quite taken with the sense of wonder the children displayed . Many of them caught and kept the lsquowishesrsquo for later. It was so simple, yet so magic.ldquoHave you got more  I was asked.ldquoTherersquos plenty outside you can pick at home time, I told them.But as I left the school, I noticed the road verge I had picked the flowers had just been mowed. All the dandelions were gone, along with the other wild flowers, and it looked lsquonice and neatrsquo.Maybewe paused for a moment to wonder at how amazing this simple and common flower is, and the benefits it gives, we would have a dferent attitude towards it.Eating hand-picked and hand-washed dandelion leaves is one way my children will eat greens. If I mix them into a stir fry, they will be eaten too. These flowers are not just an irritating weed, they are one of naturersquos gts.As I left the school at the end of the day, a child came up to me.ldquoLook, I have a wish I caught, he said, as he carefully unfurled his hand. ldquoIrsquom going to use it to send my love to my granddad."},{"url":null,"title":"work-set-to-start-to-restore-dunbar-east-beach-to-its-former-glory","story":"The once-picturesque sandy beach has lost huge amounts of sand to the tides in recent years.Now, planning permission has been given for a scheme which aims to reinvigorate the beach, which used to be a magnet for tourists.Groynes, a breakwater and rock armour are included in the proposal, which was highlighted by ward councillor Norman Hampshire at a meeting of Dunbar Community Council.Mr Hampshire, the local authorityrsquos spokesman for environment, told the Courier: ldquoWe have been working on this project for some time, trying to get a method where we can attract sand back onto the beach again.ldquoThe consultants who have been looking at it have taken some time to come up with this option: a redesign of the groyne and two breakwaters to prevent [the damage caused] when we have a large sea coming in it damages the main wall and drags sand off the beach. These breakwaters are supposed to prevent that from happening.ldquoIf we can get sand onto the beach, it should stay.The plans, submitted and approved by East Lothian Council, include repairing or replacing an existing groyne on the southern end of the beach that has fallen into disrepair.A rock groyne will be created at the northern end of the beach, opposite the junction with The Vennel, with a concrete groyne towards the south, while a rock breakwater will also be included.The work is split into four sections, with the refurbishment of the existing groyne acting to retain the beach level in the area as it is currently.Secondly, the breakwater, in addition to providing direct protection to a limited section of the defence, will allow an assessment of the capacity for a natural beach to be developed.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Mr Hampshire said time had been taken to find the design most likely to boost the beach.But he added: ldquoThere are no guarantees ndash we are fighting against nature here.Mr Hampshire told community councillors he was hopeful work could start ldquoearly summer.Discussions have been ongoing for more than five years regarding what can be done to try to turn the clock back and see the beach looking as it did in the past.Previous suggestions have included bringing sand across from Crail and St Monans in Fe.Mr Hampshire said that had not been ruled out ndash and every option would be explored ndash but it would prove ldquoreally expensive.Pippa Swan, community council chairwoman, thanked Mr Hampshire for his efforts in bringing the scheme forward.She stressed the importance of the beach and said: ldquoI think East Beach is just part of the place that Dunbar is.ldquoIt has been a holiday destination for a long time and people remember it as a sandy place and a place of leisure.ldquoThis rocky quarry we have now is something that saddens a lot of people.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said they were not yet in a position to reveal the cost of the scheme.She added: ldquoWork identied as helping to tackle erosion concerns on the East Beach will go out to tender with a view to work starting later this year, hopefully before the autumn period."},{"url":null,"title":"knox-academy-pupils-and-staff-team-up-for-edinburgh-marathon","story":"A team of  will represent Knox Academy at the Edinburgh Marathon Festival in the half marathon.Eleven pupils and eight members of staff will all pull on special t-shirts highlighting that they are running for East Lothian Special Needs Playscheme .Alex Redford, a modern studies teacher at the school, said they were looking forward to taking to the start line on May .He said: ldquoS have really tried to embody the school values of Ambition, Respect and Community this year.ldquoThey have worked so very hard on ious fundraisers throughout the year and it has been great to see them really engage with the school values.Pupils Matthew Black, Dylan Brotherston, Isabelle Bowen, Elliot Cochrane, Harry Cunningham, Hana Elder, Adam Fairgrieve, Mateusz Juchniewicz, Max Leveque, Daniel Mackinnon and Lauren Taylor will be joined on the start line by Lana Borwick , Robert Flood , Susanne Fox , Steven Illingworth , Adam Miller , Thomas Salkeld , Suzie Stewartand Mr Redford.Pupil Dylan said: ldquoThere is a little bit of friendly rivalry between the pupils.ldquoObviously, we are all quite competitive with each other and we are quite close friends.

This was because I had never done it before. I canrsquot quite believe this myself that Irsquove left it to my late s to finally make the conquest.How many times I have said to myself, and my family, as we explored dferent parts of East Lothian, ldquowe must climb North Berwick Law someday as its distinctive shape loomed into view. Itrsquos a hill visible from so many places, just asking to be explored, but I always seemed to put it off. But finally I have done it.Itrsquos a huge pile of igneous rock, basically cooled and solidied lava, a remnant of ancient volcanic activity. Itrsquos a giant plug on a now-extinct volcanic vent. Folklore tradition has a very dferent origin for the hill, as I have already written about.When you stand at the base of the Law and peer up, you can see where the great glaciers of the Ice Age have scraped and polished the hillrsquos surface, making it quite rugged and craggy in places, and smoothed down in others. Itrsquos  feet high, not a mountain by any definition, yet still impressive. If it were in a hilly area we would notice the Law less, but it looms up from flatter landscape, right next to the sea, and so demands attention.No wonder it became a place of human settlement in the Iron Age period. How could you not use this hill as a location for a fort  Its steep, rocky braes are perfect for defence, itrsquos next to the sea with a ldquoview of the whole world, as my four-year-old put it ndash and was not entirely wrong!Cast your eye to the north and across the Firth was the land of the Picts. The open sea can be seen to the north east and almost the entire of East Lothian is laid out before you, to the Lammermuirs in the south and the Pentlands in the west.Here was the land of the Gododdin, the Celtic people who lived in our country when the Romans arrived, although they had a dferent name for them: the Votadini. They survived the Roman presence, perhaps entering into some alliance to preserve their tribe. The Romans were ruthless with those who did not co-operate and submit.But later, in the seventh century, long after the Romans had gone, the Angles arrived from the south. The Gododdin resisted the invasion. The great early poem Y Gododdin tells us of a great assemblage of warriors who feasted at Edinburgh before heading south to their deaths in battle.What wailing and sadness there must have been when the news of the loss of all those young, handpicked warriors arrived. The Goddodinsrsquo fate was soon sealed, the Angles took control of the land and the Lothians became part of the Northumbrian kingdom. The remnants of the disposed Gododdin migrated to Wales, it seems, taking with them their stories and legends of what became known as lsquothe old northrsquo.These were my thoughts as I found the remains on an old round house as we climbed to the summit of the Law. At first I wasnrsquot sure ndash it looked almost like a small standing stone circle ndash but on closer examination I realised the stones were the foundations of a Celtic round house. An archaeologist friend later confirmed this.There are at least  Iron Age round houses or similar structures so far discovered on the Law some are less obvious. Butyou carefully study the ground as you ascend, evidence of these ancient homes can be seen. There is also evidence of old walls or ramparts.So here a community of the Gododdin once lived. From their front doors they could see their sister forts of Dun Penderbut now named Traprain Law, and Din Eidyn, later to be called Edinburgh.So I entered the circle of stones as my kids played on a rock nearby. I was now in a space where once a family might have lived. It was not large, but then again, why would it be  It was a place to sleep and sit round the fire together. No need to make space for all the modern lsquonecessitiesrsquo of le. Their le would have been lived outdoors. But what stories were told in this intimate space, what lives were led, and when was the last night this was used as a home There is lots more to the history of North Berwick Law.

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship.

Fergusson and deputy presiding officers Trish Godman and Alasdair Morgan are pictured with the July , , babies who visited Parliament for its th birthday. It is hoped they willfor the th celebrations. “But it was a joyful day the crowds turned out in force and we had the weather to go with it. “I was able to enjoy it once the hard work was done.“I remember walking down the Royal Mile, once the crowds had dissipated. Even then, I realised it was a once in a letime day.”There are many memorable occasions Paul can recall but one meeting in particular stands out.“There was a breakfast meeting attended by Martin McGuinness and Ian Paisley,” he said. “Martin helped Ian to his feet and they walked across the garden lobby of the Parliament together.“As someone who followed Irish politics, I had to pinch myself. For that to have happened here in the Scottish Parliament – it’s a tremendous memory.“It was so symbolic and a reminder that even the strongest adversaries can come together.”One act of legislation is also lodged in Paul’s mind.“When the same sex marriage act was passed, there was a sense of jubilation in all parties and across Parliament,” he said.In his  years, Paul has been invited to breakfast at Bute House just once.But that breakfast will also live long in his memory.He added: “In , I was responsible for helping to run the referendum which saw the Parliament being re-established in Scotland.“It was a day of great anxiety but it had gone well, with only a few technical hitches – in a time when a fax machine was state of the art!“I finished work at am and got invited to Bute House for breakfast with Donald Dewar, Henry McLeish and Sam Galbraith.“One of my best memories is enjoying breakfast with them, while reflecting on what had been a great night for them politically and a great night for us too.“I’ve never been invited back for breakfast since – but you never know, it is the th anniversary this year!”The Parliament’s current presiding officer Ken Macintosh was one of the newbies in .Until being elected to represent Eastwood in , he was a BBC television producer, working on national news programmes.But encouraged by his we Claire, he sought election to the Parliament as a Labour Party candidate.Despite claiming not to be a career politcian, he was re-elected in ,  and . And in  he was elected as an MSP for West Scotland and became Presiding Officer.The eldest of their six children, Douglas, is  this month so  was a busy year for the Macintosh clan!He recalled: “It was a very exciting time in my le. “Claire and I had just got married a year before and our son was born five days before I was elected.“So it was exciting but slightly worrying as my we thought she’d married this sensible man, with a senior position in the BBC.“Then suddenly I was giving it all up for politics. “At the time, it was a little bit of a gamble from someone who is not a gambler!“But Claire encouraged me to stand. That was all the endorsement I needed.”Ken was more used to posing questions than being asked them but it was a relatively easy transition.He explained: “Whether it is reporting on current events or trying to shape them, it’s a reflection of the same set of interests.“I’d been a member of the Labour Party since I was a student but never, ever stood for an elected office.“But I was a big supporter of devolution and it was really that that made me put myself forward.“The whole idea of doing politics in a dferent way, having a erse group of voices, that was what grabbed me.“I used to be the person shouting questions at the Prime Minister which stood me in good stead. To become the person being shouted at was quite odd though!”Ken recalls the early days with great pride.“It’s dficult for people now to recall the air of excitement it was an era of real change,” he said.“Then there was a big backlash due to the cost of the building and politically some very dficult issues.“Section  was the one I remember very vividly. It was a confrontation of the old Scotland with the new.“The Scotland I was brought up in was not the tolerant, progressive country it is today...it was certainly not an easy country to be gay in.“Section  confronted that head on.”Another milestone for Ken was the smoking ban.“When I was a kid, people always talked about Scotland having the worst cancer record in Europe,” he said.“And here we were taking control of our own health.“We were criticised for being the nanny state but I still think of it as a statement of our self-confidence.“When I first started, the Parliament made videos and I was asked what my ambitions for Scotland were and who my heroes were. “My heroes were Kenny Dalglish and Elvis Presley. I’ve since met Kenny and he didn’t disappoint!“I also wanted Scotland to be more self-confident and the smoking ban was a sign of that.”Now,  years on, the Parliament has become the centre of public le.Ken added: “At the start, so many people were openly hostile and condescending about the Parliament. “It’s testament to the people of Scotland that they’ve since embraced it and made it their own.”Tracing babies who share Parliament’s birthdayA new exhibition will take centre stage in the Parliament for the th anniversary celebrations. It will feature many of the ordinary people who have had an impact on the Parliament during its -year history. Ken said: “We are always trying to find new ways of engaging with the public and, in many ways, that’s what the exhibition and the th anniversary is all about.”The community and engagement unit is also trying to track down the babies who were born on July , .The youngsters share their birthday with the Parliament and were a big part of the th anniversary. The hope is that they can all be reunited on Saturday, June , for the th birthday party.For more information on events, visit www.parliament.scot.

We have to look at this on the basis of the outcomes, not processes and will the Minister not accept that for the over s, the outcomes look pretty grim.”Responding on behalf of the Government, Margot James MP said: “I thank the Rt. Hon. Gentleman for his intervention and I am sure that the BBC will listen to the comments which he just made with which I have considerable sympathy. This was part of a fair deal for the BBC. At the time the BBC Director General, and I have already quoted him, that he did say also that it was a strong deal for the BBC and that it provided financial stability.”Adding further comment, Mr. Carmichael said: “It is easy to say you are sympathetic but still the Government is doing nothing to set it right. They have tried to duck responsibility by pushing it onto the BBC, but this is not about who is responsible, but what the impact is on the people who will be affected.“Over s are often on a low fixed pension, so to suddenly have an extra £ outgoing is a huge chunk of their income. Many older people are reliant on their TVs as a way of avoiding loneliness and stripping them of their TV Licence is likely to leave signicant numbers unable to watch their favourite programmes.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is the second year that Britt Harcus has helped guide this KTHI project. She took the opportunity to thank those who had helped make it possible.#The KTHI need a big thank you for their funding,# she said.#Without them, this project would simply not have happened. #Sandy Firth, who came to visit the bairns and has been a great source of knowledge and inspiration for the class. I think it#s important that wartime stories and memories are passed on and not forgotten.#Kim and Robert Foden also deserve a special mention for their help in this project as well as Dave Gray at Radio Orkney.

It is an information gathering and assessment exercise which helps stakeholders, the public and the planning authority understand the potential environmental impacts of major development proposals.The Orkney Community Wind Farm Project could generate signicant income and community benefit for Orkney, say the council.Plans for a development of up to around MW in Hoy were announced to the local community last year — with sites for a development of up to MW on the island of Faray and up to MW on shoreside farmland at Quanterness outside Kirkwall now also being investigated.The scoping report for Faray is available at here.

But there was no mention of a new business case for the government’s planned not-for-profit energy company.Ms Sturgeon said: “As the energy market continues to evolve, we need to ensure that it is more responsive to people’s needs and interests.“If we are to influence consumer behaviour in the future we need to build trust – and ensure that the system puts people first. That’s why the Scottish Government is publishing our Energy Consumer Action Plan. It sets out what we will do to ensure better outcomes for consumers, in our energy market.”Another pledge in the plan is to examine whether newly devolved responsibility for debt advice can help the government support those in fuel debt. The latest figures from Ofgem show that . per cent of Scottish electricity consumers and . per cent of gas consumers are in debt, with many having no arrangement to repay their debt.

doing so much damage.“And the way to send that clear, unequivocal message is to vote SNP and then we send it loudly and clearly.”EU nationals working at Glasgow University told the First Minister about their experience of Brexit so far, with senior lecturer Maria Economou, who moved from her native Greece to Scotland with her husband in , saying it was “very worrying” and that her family had sought legal advice regarding their status.Having applied for settled status, which incurred a £ fee for adults until this was scrapped by the UK Government, she said: “It’s not the money, although

We have the worst levels by a country mile.Figures assembled by the debt relief charity Step Change indicate that while the average Scottish mortgage debt is £,, in the constituency of Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch it is a whopping £,.Even within the Highlands as a whole that is a shocking sum # the Highland average of mortgage arrears is £,. That is almost twice the national average. But in Skye, we are told, our arrears are six times the national average, with almost a third of mortgage payers affected.We should introduce a note of caution. Step Change has extrapolated its conclusions from a small sample of the population. It is possible,not likely, that things are not quite that bad.Unless Step Change is completely off the chart, things are nonetheless bad enough. And our indebtedness extends beyond house payments. The Highlands and Islands have the highest levels of electricity bill arrears in Scotland, something which will be owed to our climate and our extortionate bills, and which has already been advertised by our uniquely high levels of fuel poverty.Overall, people in the Highlands and Islands are twice as much in debt as where in Scotland, and people in the north-west of Scotland are even more in hock to lenders and to utility companies.Those astonishingly high figures for mortgage debt # and therefore, of course, of potential foreclosures and homelessness # in this region cannot easily be explained away. It is the result of a combination of factors.House prices in Skye and the western Highlands began to rise, from a low base, in the s.The speed of growth took everybody by surprise. A simple crofthouse which in the early s might have sold for £, or less can now fetch ten times that amount.The selling price was dictated more by location than the quality of the property. At first the holiday home sector played the most active part in pushing up prices.Throw a st century tourist boom and all of its ancillary money spinners such as buy-to-let properties and Airbnb into the mix, add a resident population which has grown by  per cent since the s, and the result is a skewed and uncontrollable local housing market.It is a market into which local working people are obliged to enter. Everybody needs somewhere to live. Local housing associations have done a good job in offering affordable rented homes. Clearly, however, Skye and the north-west have never recovered from the Tory assault on local authority #council# housing in the s. In the absence of sufficient decent social housing, people have to buy.The result has been that young people, in particular, have been obliged to enter what is now one of the most expensive and volatile housing markets in the United Kingdom. Those same young people live in a region with some of the worst-paid and insecure jobs in the country.That is not a formula for a stable society. Low wages and high house prices, in a region where the general cost of living is also high, provides the perfect recipe for unsustainable levels of mortgage arrears, as well as unpaid electricity and other bills # and that is exactly what we have got.There are two obvious solutions. They will not be achieved overnight, but they should be pushed quickly up the agenda of all of our local businesses and elected representatives.It is clear that the tourism riches that have recently descended on Skye and the north-west are not evenly distributed. If we want people to stay and live and work here, they must be paid at least a living wage: a salary which will enable them to buy houses.And central and local government must invest much more in social housing. That will depend upon finance from the Scottish Government and the initiative of Highland Council. The £ million pledged this week by the former towards local authority housing is a good start. But there are  councils in Scotland. The money cannot be ided equally. Priority must be given to regions such as this which suffer most gravely from unaffordable housing. Otherwise it will be a drop in the Minch."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/barra-airport-1.jpg","title":"new flight bank to give barra community more","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineCreating a bank of  flights between Barra and Glasgow which can be used by the community at busy times of the year has been welcomed by the chairman of Castlebay Community Council.Michael Galbraith said the announcement, made last in late April by Transport Secretary Michael Matheson, was all about giving locals #more control# over the number of flights rather than having them dictated by Loganair.#If there is a wedding or an event like Barrathon then we could well need the extra flights and we can pass that request on to Loganair,# he added. #First of all it will go through the chairs of Castlebay and Northbay community councils and we will disseminate that request to the other members.

He good-humouredly reflects on his lack of accomplishment in that department as a skill he “kind of needed” to carve out a career in drama. Luckily, he has found both fulfilment and success not only in his day job in the finance industry, but also through his work at the local credit union.Christopher has been a lelong member of Newington Credit Union, which was founded in  by his grandfather, Sean Caughey. Since coming on board as a Director in December , Christopher has striven to make a dference in the local community like his grandfather before him.“My granddad founded the credit union so that the local community would have somewhere they could save money, where everyone could pool together their resources so thatpeople needed a loan then there would be that central community hub that they could use and that’s something we’re doing to this very day,” he said.“I feel the credit union is really important. When I was in England I spoke to people about the credit union model and they were amazed because they don’t have the same focus on credit unions.In the last few years we’ve seen the controversy theresurrounding payday loan companies with massive interest rates, but that might not have happenedthere were credit unions. People who would otherwise have gone to a payday lender can come to the credit union and get a rate where they won’t be exploited, which is very important. I wanted to be able to help the credit union by using my expertise in accountancy to help its development.“I’ve been involved with the monthly meetings where we look at how the credit union is progressing. It’s really to make sure that we are continuing to serve our purpose. I have started to get involved in the investment committee to look at what we are doing with our money. I’m also involved in trying to get more people to join the credit union. For me, it’s very important to get more people – especially young people – involved in the credit union.”During his short time as a Newington Credit Union Director, Christopher has overseen an upsurge in members following a highly successful recruitment drive in March – something he says he is “very proud of”. He is also spearheading the credit union’s efforts to bring in a erse range of volunteers to help develop the organisation.“I want to get more Directors on board,” he said. “I’m one of the younger directors on the board, so I want to get more people my age involved. It’s good to have people from a range of backgrounds and it’s a good way to get involved with the local community. I really wanted to improve the North Belfast area, it’s something that I’m quite passionate about, so getting on board has really helped me do that. A lot of people think thatthey don’t have a financial or business background that they can’t get involved, but that’s not the case.“I came from a drama background and became a director, so the only real qualication is that you want to help develop the Credit Union and the local community.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"church leaders meet stormont politicians","story":"LEADERS of the Catholic, Presbyterian, Anglican and Methodist churches in Ireland have held talks with Stormont parties in the latest attempt to break the political deadlock.British and Irish Ministers including Secretary of State Karen Bradley also attended the meeting on Tuesday.The delegation of church leaders told the Stormont parties it was time to demonstrate courageous political leadership.Archbishop Richard Clarke said: #One of the messages we tried to send today is that in a vacuum, other forces will move into that vacuum and take control of it.#And for that reason, there is this absolutely huge need to ensure that somehow, normal political le starts again.#Archbishop Eamon Martin added, “If we don’t sit around the table and talk, then what  ”Following the meeting, Sinn Féin leader in the north Michelle O’Neill said: “All of society has a stake in this process so we very much welcome the start of a broad engagement with wider society beginning with the church leaders that were at Stormont today and we thank them for their contribution.“We want to meet with a wide range of civic society, all the churches, the trade unions, business organisations, womens groups, language groups, the community and voluntary sector and everyone out there because this process and these institutions belong to us all.“These talks have the potential to restore the power-sharing institutions and that is the best way to ensure that the next generation benefits from the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process.“We all know what the outstanding issues are.

Just as people come to the Clonard Novena, my family would have gone to the St Majella Novena every year over the generations, it’s a church that I know very well and love.”Fr Kehoe spoke of how there is great goodness in people “wherever you go” and how much he will miss the people he has got to know since first arriving at  Clonard Gardens in .“Clonard is very much inserted in this community, their pride and love for it is something I haven’t experienced anywhere .“People have the same struggles and dficulties. I will really miss Clonard, miss the people I got to know here. When the changes were published they were a bit of a shock.“Clonard is a church and faith community like no other. The people of Clonard are amazing, they are the most generous people I’ve ever met, they would literally go out of their way to help you in anyway they could.“I spent seven years in Cork learning to say things without actually saying them, when I came to Clonard there were no back doors. It was lovely to work with that, you knew where you stood with people.”While the sterling work of Fr Kehoe at Clonard is well appreciated by the local people, he is keen to point out that it takes a considerable team effort for Clonard to work.“I’m not sure people really understand just how big it is. There are over  people involved in Clonard, from our ministries, readers, Eucharist Ministers. Clonard has become a very signicant place for music and our director Cathal Murphy has really pushed that with our choirs and opening up Clonard as a venue for concerts.“Clonard’s name is out there, when you have such a beautul and sacred place at your disposal there are people coming to Clonard for music that may have never been before.”With preparations gathering pace for next month’s eagerly-awaited Novena, Fr Kehoe says he will take with him forever the “phenomenon” that the annual June festival of prayer has become.“You have -, people a day coming into the area. People are coming with huge burdens, you can see by the end that they are leaving feeling healed, supported and feeling that God is very close to them in their lives.

The bus contains slogans \"debunking\" the claims of Brexiteers before the referendum. Responding to Mr Eastwoods debate offer, DUP director of elections Gavin Robinson said there will be plenty of time for discussion.\"This is a publicity stunt and will be treated as such,\" Mr Robinson said. \"Diane Dodds will be in several TV studios debating all the candidates including Colum over the next  days. \"Colum has had two very awkward problems with his bus slogan. Firstly, its our money coming back which we send to Brussels, and secondly, as a nationalist, his argument being based on money utterly undermines his campaign for a united Ireland. \"Whilst Colum wants to attack Diane, we will focus on giving the people the choice. \"We will be urging people to use this election to send a message that they want democracy to be respected and the will of the people implemented. \"Colum wants to thwart the democratic wishes of the people. We want to respect democracy.\"Yesterday Education Secretary Damian Hinds said the European elections will be seen as an opportunity for the ultimate protest vote.He told the BBC the elections would be dficult for the Conservatives and that \"for some people this is the second referendum\".Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer, meanwhile, toldthat he doubts a cross-party deal lacking a confirmatory referendum could pass Parliament. However, Mr Kennedy called for people to work together to deliver a sensible Brexit to end uncertainty and deliver stability.\"The last thing that our country needs is a second referendum which would be incredibly polarising and damaging to peoples faith in our democratic system,\" he said.Northern Irelands  European candidates also include Alliance leader Naomi Long and TUV leader Jim Allister."},{"url":null,"title":"i am a strong contender in race for third eu seat alliances long","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Balmoral ShowNorth West NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The fate of the third seat, held by the retiring Ulster Unionist Jim Nicholson, is less certain.Speaking at the launch of the Alliance manesto at the CIYMS sports grounds in east Belfast yesterday, Mrs Long said her party is best placed to take that seat.The party manesto includes pledges to secure a peoples vote, keep borders open, protect the economy and support the work of the EU.Mrs Long said: \"The recent council election results, in addition with a number of polls and surveys, show Alliance is in prime position to not only substantially increase our number of first preference votes but also gain the required transfers from others to take the third seat and show the EU, and indeed the world, Northern Ireland wants to Remain.\"Brexit is not an orange or green issue and I am not an orange or green politician.\"In , people right across our community came together to vote Remain. I believe we can achieve better together and show that same spirit again on May .\"Mrs Long said she believes Northern Irelands third seat is going to come down to transfers, and urged voters totwo Remain candidates.\"In the recent polls that have been produced, we are literally within the margin of error, neck-and-neck with the Ulster Unionists and the SDLP,\" she said.\"The Ulster Unionists are the current incumbent, and its very clearwe are neck-and-neck with the current incumbent, we are in contention for that seat.\"Unlike the Ulster Unionists who are moving backwards, and the SDLP who have been drting backwards, we have forward momentum, so the opportunity is there for us to attract crucial transfers because that is what will decide the last seat, not just the first preference votes but how many transfers we can draw from across the board,\" she said.\"Thats why I am encouraging people who vote Alliance to vote for other pro-remain candidates after they have voted Alliance number one, and I would hope that other pro-Remain candidates will want to do the same.\"Its important we have two voices in Europe who are pro-Remain, who are making a strong statement to government about how Northern Ireland feels about the EU,\" the Alliance leader said.\"But I believe it is also important that we have a voice there that is not simply a unionist or nationalist voice, that doesnt further polarise this issue but that can represent the broad swathe of public opinion and civic society. And I believe I am best placed to do that.\"Alliance’s key manesto prioritiesReinforcing progressive values. Alliance said it believes in “strength through ersity, respecting people, enabling opportunities, protecting rights and inclusion”.Supporting work of the EU. The manesto states Northern Ireland’s participation in the EU brings huge advantages.Protecting our economy. It says the Customs Union and Single Market “provide massive economic opportunities to our manufacturing, agri-food and service sectors”.Keeping open borders. Alliance believes any form of Brexit risks new isions and barriers, adding: “We must keep the open borders throughout these islands, and preserve everyone’s freedom to trade and live their lives freely.” Securing a people’s vote. Alliance wants a fresh referendum, with Remain on the ballot.

KPMG have been paid . million and . million euro respectively, the Department of Communications confirmed in written correspondence seen by the Press Association.The Government has come under sustained criticism in the weeks since announcing the plan, which it says is value for money despite the project costing around five billion euro, and the fact the state will have no ownership of the project.Minister for Communications Richard Bruton confirmed that in February , his department appointed KPMG to provide advisory services in relation to the plan.The  and  reports form part of “the overall advice and support provided by KPMG to the Department”, he wrote.Total payments to KPMG for its services since its appointment in  to date amount to . million euro, including VAT.Also in February , the same department appointed PwC to provide “strategy development, economic analysis and State Aid advice”.Total payments to PwC for its services since its appointment in  to date amount to . million euro, including VAT.Sinn Fein’s Jonathan O’Brien claims the expenditure raises questions around the influence these consultancy firms have over the Government.“It won’t be lost on anyone that it was KPMG that audited the banks before the financial crash, or that these firms often audit companies that are involved in scandals and are then paid by Government to investigate those scandals,” the Cork TD said.“Regarding the National Broadband Plan, it was KPMG and PwC that recommended the privatisation model that is now due to cost the taxpayer three billion euro for infrastructure the State won’t even own, with serious issues around affordability and the capacity for delivery.“Since then, we have found out that they have been paid a combined  million euro in pursuit of this flawed plan.“PwC and KPMG are driving the wrong policies with the Government nodding without question.“We have been advocating for a State-led model using the semi-state enterprise ESB, with the infrastructure remaining in public ownership.“The Government has called on Sinn Fein to provide detailed costings of our own plan.“We in the opposition are limited in our resources, butwe had  million euro and the civil service behind us, I’m sure we would do a better job.“We are calling on Government to use the resources they are privileged to have to undertake a detailed analysis of a public model using ESB while there is time left.”Likewise, Fianna Fail has called for an Oireachtas investigation to be conducted into the bidding process behind the National Broadband Plan.The party’s communications spokesman, Timmy Dooley, proposed that the Communications Committee initiate an investigation into the multimillion-euro project amid sustained criticism of the plan from opposition parties.Documentation released by the Government last week showed that Secretary General Robert Watt and his officials had strongly recommended against the Government appointing the preferred bidder, Granahan McCourt, on grounds of affordability, risk and value for money.The top civil servant in the Department of Public Expenditure warned that the plan poses great financial risk and called for the procurement process to be cancelled.It was the only remaining bidder for the contract to deliver high-speed broadband to more than , homes and businesses.The roll out of the scheme, which will bring fibre broadband to . million people across the country, will begin at the end of the year.It is expected to take seven years to complete.The Department of Communications has been

I had great help from the Laird family in the earlier days until my own family got up and were fit to help.Felixrsquos antidote to hard work was finding time to relax and enjoy himself.ldquoI loved watching horse racing, football and snooker on the TV and often attended Downpatrick races in the earlier days, he said.The secret to his long le  ldquoI was blessed with the company of a loving family, friends and neighbours and I love to see the younger generations coming to visit, he said.Felix says he always advised his family and friends to be content with what they had and not to take le too seriously.ldquoI dealt with things as they happened, thatrsquos how I dealt with le, he continued. ldquoI feel very lucky to have reached this age as a lot of my friends and family have passed before me. I always leave a weeof tea in the bottom of my cup so maybe this has helped me live so long!Felix was born in Ballykinlar just weeks before the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, which officially ended the First World War, on June , .He was the fourth child of Felix and Ellen Burns and learnt the value of hard work from his parents. His father was a butcher, while his mother ran a small sweet shop and cafe and used to bake bread for the soldiers, particularly the GIs who were stationed at Ballykinlar army barracks during the Second World War.Felix was in his early twenties during the war. His youngest daughter, Anne, says the bombing of Belfast is something that stuck with him all his le.ldquoThe Blitz in Belfast is something that Daddy always talks about. He says he can remember that he and a friend climbed up to a top of a nearby hill to watch the bomber planes. The noise and drone of the bombers flying over was something that still stays in his mind.The family had moved to Rossglass when he was  and daughter Eileen recalls how his father courted her mother, Isobel , when she was just .ldquoDaddy tells us how he had to cycle into Downpatrick to go to the pictures with Mummy so it was a very dferent time to now, she said.The couple married in  and went on to have nine sons and four daughters mdash the late Oliver, Peter, Sean, Kate, Paddy, Eileen, Dominic, Eamonn, Kevin, Malachy, Martin, Mary and Anne.He worked the -acre farm at Ballylig Road until his later years but his children say that he still enjoys giving his son, Peter, who now runs the farm, his expert advice to keep him right.Felix grew potatoes for many years and most of the people from the village picked for him at some time or other, including Killoughrsquos own Canon Sean Rogan, former parish priest of Downpatrick, who visited him on his birthday.Eileen says that while their father was strict with them, he was always very kind and fun-loving.ldquoDaddy is cheerful, happy but believes in hard work. Hersquos very resilient and now he really enjoys seeing a good day on the farm and being brought out to the porch where he can hear the birds. He has always loved farming and is very passionate about nature, she said.Mrs Burns died of cancer in  and Felix has had more than several close calls with his health since then.Eileen said: ldquoHersquos had four heart attacks, hip replacements and skin cancer, but he has been blessed with good health and we put that down to his hard work and plain eating. He wouldnrsquot have any kind of takeaway about him.For the last  years, he has received daily care from two healthcare assistants, Cindy and Amera, who the family say are devoted to their father and they are forever grateful for what they do for him.While two of his children live away from home mdash Eileen in London and Eamon in Kilkenny, Felix kept his travels to Britain and Ireland.ldquoDaddy came over to see me in London when he was  and was on the Tube for the first time in his le. He couldnrsquot believe how erse London was and the buzz about it. He loved it, added Eileen.Felix is known for his friendliness and was never one to pass a neighbour on a lane or the road without stopping for a chat.He and his two childhood friends of more than  years, Henry Starkey and Tam Montgomery, were stalwarts at the Minerstown Tavern every Saturday night mdash so much so that there is a framed painting of the three of them hanging today in the bar.Felix and his family had asked friends to give donations in lieu of gts to Cancer Fund for Childrenrsquos Daisy Lodge Centre in Newcastle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Claragh Bridge rally raises £3%2C000 for charity  ","story":"CLARAGH Bridge Vintage Club held their annual rally in aid of Motor Neurone Disease Associationunder blue skies and fine sunshine on Friday evening.Over  tractors and  vintage classic cars and Land Rovers revved up their engines and took to the grassy catwalk, in the field behind Oasis Community Centre.The event was organised by club chairman Liam Quinn, from Drumaroad, in memory of local farmer Hugh McClean, from Ballykinlar, who died from the illness in September last year, just six years after his diagnosis.

At the moment the money will have to come from local rates, although Down councillors are anxiously looking for Government grant aid.This week they were warned that thatfinal repair work is not carried out this summer a large section of the wall could be washed into the sea.Council workmen are currently completing a pound, lsquoholding operationrsquo on the wall and  tons of boulders were brought to the site this week.However, a consultant engineer appointed by Down Council, warned that the wall was continuing to slide in the sea and that fresh cracks were appearing at the base.He said temporary measures had been essential, but warned thatpermanent work was not carried out he could not guarantee the wall would still be standing next summer.Mr Seamus Byrne, council clerk, explained that repair work was not normally covered by grant aid, but he had written to the Department of Environment and was awaiting a reply.Newcastle councillor Norman Bicker reminded councillors that another section of the wall, beside the damaged section, belonged to the Department of Environment and this was also beginning to crack.He felt that since the council had attended to short term measures on the council-owned section, the Department should be taking steps to repair the damage to its section.STRANGFORD mdash Dympna Marron, from Myra Road, Strangford, finished third overall in theNurse of the Year finals. Staff Nurse Dympna, who works at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children, set out for London last week to face up to the challenges of  others in similar careers, but with many more years of experience.Dympna did nothome with the crown, but she was placed third mdash a wonderful achievement considering she is so young. In fact, she is the youngest nurse to compete for the coveted title, which was televised nationally.ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed the experience, said Dympna, who took home a television set, a cheque for pound and a bottle of champagne. ldquoAll the nurses taking part in the final were delightful. The nurse who won the title deserved to do so.In October Dympna will set out for a holiday in Hong Kong, her reward for winning the Northern Ireland section of the competition and will take her mother with her for company.PORTAFERRY mdash Declan Mackell, a  year-old yachtsman who intends sailing round the world, made the first important step on his expedition when he launched his boat in Portaferry last week.Although his history-making trip doesnrsquot start until the end of the month, Declan had to get his boat from dry dock into the water to continue his preparations mdash and to record the occasion he had television cameras standing by at quayside.It wasnrsquot Declanrsquos idea to have the television crew there, but Gloria Hunnord and her Good Evening Ulster team were keen to have the scene on tape for their teatime show.Gloria not only interviewed the yachtsman, but launched his boat in style by smashing a champagne bottle off the bows in traditional style.Declan still has a lot to do before starting his trip on May , but now that the boat has been launched preparations can continue more quickly.CROSSGAR mdash The only two-day horse trials in Ireland took place at Rademon, Crossgar, under the direction of Mr Ernest McMillen and proved again to be a great success.Much work had been done to make the roads and track sections more effective, but a number of competitors found short cuts over sizeable stone walls and across a river at a fairly dficult spot. Not hall, however, managed this unscathed.The cross country course was greatly altered from last year and included a dficult fence built around the famous Crawford Monument which commands the skyline.A large number of competitors travelled from the South of Ireland and one from Scotland.DUNDRUM mdash The third annual general meeting of the Dundrum Seaforde Combat Cancer Group was held recently in Dundrum Field Centre. Mrs N F Mitchell, in her role as chairman, thanked everyone who made the past year so successful.The Rev J K Laird, on behalf of his we who has been treasurer for four years but who has been ill recently, reported that the group had sent pound, to headquarters in the past year. The guest speaker, Mrs N Gordon, of Annalong Combat Cancer Group, said she was very impressed by the work of the committee and wished them every success in the future.BALLYGOWAN mdash A Ballygowan quarry has been voted the cleanest in Europe by a host of continental visitors. The unusual accolade has been awarded to the quarry belonging to Miskelly Bros where, it is said, it is hard to find a stone out of place.ldquoWith tyres for lorries and loaders costing up to pound each, it makes good sense to keep the place as clean as possible, says Mr Fergus McKeown, managing director.CRICKET mdash The new cricket season began on Saturday in the worst possible fashion for Downpatrick when they scored one of their lowest ever totals in an eight wicket home defeat against double champions Waringstown.It was a disastrous day for the locals, who scored only  runs. They failed to make the good start needed and slowly went downhill to a heavy defeat, which leaves them wondering what lies ahead.A late stand from Tom Hanna and Robert Strain pushed the score above the half century, but in general it was a poor batting performance..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Horace reflects on life in BBC radio show  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH historian Horace Reid was one of the guests on BBC Radio Ulsterrsquos Time of Our Lives programme on Sunday.Horace and fellow guest Frank Rodgers, an expert in Irish stained glass windows, were interviewed by presenter Colum Arbuckle.After studying at Queenrsquos University Horace began a -year nursing career at the Royal Victoria Hospital in , specialising first in the fracture clinic, and then in cardiac theatre.At Queenrsquos his tutor, Hugh Purcell, had given him this advice: ldquoIf you want to be an expert in any subject, get a shoebox. Horace soon began researching the effects of the Troubles on the RVH, and started collecting photos, videos and press clippings. The shoebox collection grew and eventually occupied two filing cabinets.He had intended to write a book on the subject, but sudden illness put an end to that intention. He subsequently made his Troubles archive available to other authors, such as the late Kate OrsquoHanlon, senior sister in RVH Casualty, Margaret Wilson and Moore Sinnerton.In June  he sustained a sudden onset of severe ME, which immediately ended his hospital career. He spent most of the next five years flat on his back in bed, with frequent migraines, insomnia, continual acute flu-like symptoms, muscle pain and weakness, weird new allergies, and a brain gone AWOL.On air on Sunday he compared ME to having a defective battery on a mobile phone. Instead of the battery operating for  hours a day, it reluctantly provides power for only two hours. And once flat, it takes a full day to recharge. Horace never thought it was a fatal condition. But it has the same ill effects as a killer disease mdash energy loss on such a scale suddenly deprives you of job, career, income, and social and family le.ME was first defined in  by a famous Ulster doctor, Sir Donald Acheson. In the  years since, the NHS has made very little progress in identying a cause, or developing a cure. So ME patients find it very dficult to access competent medical care. But they have no dficulty in encountering hostility, prejudice, and stigma.Horace received exemplary care from a small number of NHS doctors. But he experienced hostility, suspicion and a damaging lack of knowledge with some others. His eventual route to partial rehabilitation was provided, not by the NHS, but by the arts and media sectors in Belfast and Down District.Part of his initial five-year nightmare was that he couldnrsquot read much, or watch TV. By the time he got to the bottom of a page, he had forgotten what he had read at the top. Eventually he discovered thathe underlined relevant sentences in a book, he could then fix information in his memory.Triggered by the cover illustration on Jonathon Bardonrsquos first edition A History of Ulster, in  he had begun researching the  Rebellion and the associated fighting in his home town of Ballynahinch. He continued this exploration after illness hit in . By  mdash the Rebellion bicentenary mdash he had acquired a wide knowledge of th century politics, personalities, warfare and weapons.A number of NHS personnel seemed to doubt Horacersquos sanity and or integrity mdash an attitude they automatically extended to all ME patients. But other prominent iniduals, in equally august institutions, took an entirely dferent view. Horace had amassed a knowledge of the  period, and in  they all wanted to access it mdash Brian Turner from the Down Museum, Dr Desmond Bailie of the Presbyterian Historical Society, Moore Sinnerton at the BBC and Jane Leonard at the Ulster Museum.Post-ME Horace had signicant dficulty with reading and writing at any . So everyone was very patient with the small amounts and slow pace of his product. But eventually he produced a well-reviewed major article on the Battle of Ballynahinch, . And he gave a lively bicentennial lecture on Betsy Gray to a capacity audience at the Ulster Museum. A new career was launched, though on a much, much smaller scale than before the onset of illness.Horace has now developed a lecturing technique which overcomes his dficulty with the written word. His PowerPoints are really image-rich slide-shows, and he talks to what he sees in the pictures. Audiences remark that ldquohe can talk for an hour without notes, unaware that he continually faces the screen, and uses the images as visual prompts. They quite like the near-cinema experience.Recently Pamela Cooper, of the Lecale Historical Society, has further improved on his technique. She made a tran of his Five Montalto Dynasties lecture, and then turned it into a major printed article mdash his first in  years.Horace continues to have signicant ME disability, with the typical energy deficit, so for him local history is a vital form of occupational therapy. One of his reasons for going on radio was to thank all those down the decades who have given him an outlet for his hobby.These include the late Dr. Brum Henderson, of the Ballynahinch Murals Group Vincent Fullam, of Ballynahinch Regeneration Joanne Patterson, BBC, Your Place and Mine Martyn Todd, of Discover Saintfield: Dr Winston Shaw and the Presbyterian Historical Society Gordon Wilson and the late David Anderson at Montalto Estates Dr Eacuteamon Phoenix the Editors of the Mourne Observer and Down Recorder, on many occasions Dr. Terry Cross at Killaney Lodge Karen Patterson, of the Rowallane Slieve Croob Partnership and many Probus branches and local historical societies.Arthur Davidson, Derek Rowlinson, and Peter Rowan have always kept him supplied with rare books., as did Deirdre Armstrong when the SEELB Library Board Irish Special Collection was based in Ballynahinch. Recently, published authors have consulted him about the  period, such as Conor OrsquoClery, Ken Dawson and Guy Beiner.For Horace, outdoor recreation is almost a thing of the past. But MLA Jim Wells allows him on board his birdwatching boat trips on the north coast. By this means it is possible to enjoy unique access to glorious scenery at Carrick-a-Rede, Torr Head, Fair Head and Rathlin, all without getting out of your seat, or walking a yard.Guests on Sundayrsquos BBC programme were allowed to play one piece of music: Horace picked a paraphrase from the Scottish Psalter. During the worst period of his illness he was often unable to read, but he could always enjoy music. He steadily worked his way through the HMV Classical CD catalogue. And he also reverted to the music of his childhood ndash hymns he remembered from the Ballynahinch Methodists.Dr. William Drennan, founder of the United Irishmen, once worshipped at First Presbyterian Church in Ballynahinch in . That was before the introduction of hymn-singing and church organs. Horacersquos own Scottish ancestors probably arrived around , and he imagined they would have used paraphrases in their services.This article is an amalgam of what Horace actually said on radio ndash and what he would have said given another half hour on microphone!

Tickets are pound each and will be available at agricultural shows, including Balmoral Show which begins today.Kerry Angus, of the NI Kerry Hill Sheep Society, thanked all the local businesses who donated prizes for the raffle and said Mr Smythrsquos family and the society were overwhelmed by their generosity.Kerry said: ldquoPatrick was born in Leitrim and went to Legananny Primary School before going to St Malachyrsquos High School in Castlewellan, where he formed friendships that would last a letime.ldquoPatrick joined the emerging Leitrim Fontenoys Marching Band and toured the country with his best mate Martin OrsquoHare as a drummer in the early rsquos and it was around this time that he met his we, Bridie.ldquoThey finally married in May  and for the first year Patrick put his talents to work in building their family home on the site of the old Leitrim Post Office formerly owned by his grandfather.ldquoBy  they had three daughters Niamh, Aoe and Kyla.

He was threatening to spoil the party after polling a particularly impressive  first preference votes.While not considered a threat by pundits, McMurray came just  votes short mdash after transfers mdash of causing a major shock.In the end, what was proving an uncomfortable evening and early morning for Sinn Fein sitting councillor Willie Clarke, who described the election campaign as the most intensive he had ever been involved in, and newcomer Leeanne McEvoy, ended in relieved smiles.As the duo waited for their election to be confirmed, Doran, who had been awake from .am, was nervously placing the floor, admitting to reporters he felt a ldquonervous wreck as what at times seemed a laborious election count continued.The smile on his face was unmissable when it was formally confirmed that his partners had been elected but, sadly, for the Sinn Fein duo, there was only a handful of party supporters in the election count centre to congratulate them as everyone  had gone home.Nonetheless, Doran, McEvoy and Clarke celebrated together, clearly recognising the signicance of the result for Republicans in an area once regarded as a unionist stronghold.The SDLPrsquos Laura Devlin, who was popping in and out of the count to keep an eye on her new baby Polly who is two months old, comfortably retained her seat with , votes but the election marked the end for her party colleague, Brian Quinn, who was eliminated after polling just  first preference votes.Given that he was so far behind, it was inevitable that Quinn, who was a member of the former Newry and Mourne Council, would lose his seat, although early on in the count it was not clear to whom. When the SDLP stalwart was formally eliminated from the contest he was consoled by his loyal party colleagues.As for DUP man Hanna, his canvass was hampered by the fact that  weeks ago he underwent hip replacement surgery, restricting his mobility. However, the voters came out in numbers helping him top the poll which he admitted he hadnrsquot expected.Elsewhere, there were resounding wins for the UUPrsquos Harold McKee mdash who is ing to the council chamber for a second time after losing his South Down Assembly seat in  when the number was reduced from six to five mdash and Independent Unionist Henry Reilly.The highly respected McKee is no stranger to elections and admitted that the most recent was his easiest to date. Given the absence of the Assembly he believes it is time more powers were handed to local councils to let them get on with the job of looking after their respective districts.McKee insists that local government is about delivering for people, highlighting the importance of all councillors working together for the benefit of their respective areas.Reilly, who fought his first election  years ago and along with McKee was elected on the second count, surprisingly admitted that he was worried going into this one as he did not have a party machine behind him. He described his election as ldquomost satisfying.While his vote dipped by over  from , Reilly explained that when he topped the poll five years ago as a member of UKIP, the party was spending tens of thousands of pounds on its EU election campaign and he was its Northern Ireland candidate.Afraid that his council vote could have collapsed by as much as , Reilly focused his election campaign solely on Kilkeel and Annalong which he described as his ldquoheartland also expressing concern that he was not allow to declare himself as an Independent Unionist on the ballot paper and that Alliance was running a strong candidate.As for McMurray, he insisted that he had no regrets switching to The Mournes as it ldquofelt the right thing to do and was pleased with his performance first time out in an area which was new to him.He used a football analogy to describe coming just  votes short of causing a major upset, adding: ldquoItrsquos like playing well away from home and losing -. A great game and great performance but you donrsquot get the three points.

It is a problem they need to solve with SDLP and Sinn Fein sources suggesting better engagement with these particular voters is needed.The SDLPrsquos share of the vote in the Downpatrick DEA has decreased from almost % five years ago to .% with Sinn Feinrsquos share decreasing slightly from .% in  to .%.By contrast, Independent candidate Cadogan Enright increased his vote by , comfortably passing the , mark for the first time.Pundits were suggesting that Enright could end up locked in a battle for the fth seat with the SDLPrsquos Trainor and there were audible gasps in the Newry count centre when it was officially confirmed that the Independent candidate had finished second behind Sharvin on first preference votes, immediately placing increasing pressure on those chasing the remaining three seats.Enrightrsquos increased vote, which did not come as a surprise to the man himself, is viewed as a reward for his hard work with community groups in Downpatrick and those dotted across Lecale where he is extremely active in village communities.And, just like in , many of these groups officially endorsed his candidacy and played a key role in an election canvass which saw a small army of workers trudge across the district on his behalf knocking doors and putting election material through letterboxes.Regarded as a politician who gets things done, Enright is a thorn in the side of the big two parties in Downpatrick who took time to digest his performance at last weekrsquos poll.Enright insists that analysis of the past four council elections in the Downpatrick DEA confirms that both the SDLP and Sinn Fein are losing favour with the people of Down and Lecale and that over the same period the unionist vote has remained steady at around seven percent.Aontuacutersquos Macartan Digney surprised many when he polled  votes and there are those who suggest that the well known candidate who is a member of the Downpatrick Community Collective mdash an umbrella body for local community groups and residentsrsquo associations ndash may have taken votes off Enright whose first preference performance may have been even better.As for the SDLP, the party heaved a huge sigh of relief that its three runners, including the provincersquos longest serving councillor, Dermot Curran, made it home.All the party candidates had a fight on their hands with veteran Curran openly admitting that he was worried going into the election, describing it as his toughest to date. Sinn Fein clearly had the SDLP worried.Republicans fought an intense campaign as it always do and there was obvious disappointment that only Hanlon, contesting her first election, secured a seat, with Madden unable to join her.Hanlon, who works for South Down MLA Emma Rogan, ticks an important box for Sinn Fein as she lives and works in Downpatrick and is acutely aware of the key issues which she will be able to address at council level.Not having a councillor on the ground in the county town was an issue the party wanted to address at this election, but the hope of having two candidates evaporated as the Downpatrick count progressed and Madden struggled to secure the transfers he needed to join his party colleagues in the chamber.Alliance, which did not field a candidate in , was delighted with the performance of student Tiernan Laird who polled  votes,  ahead of the UUPrsquos Alexander Burgess, who was the partyrsquos third choice to contest one of the five seats up for grabs in Downpatrick.The DUPrsquos James Savage increased the party vote by five, polling  first preferences, while the Green Partyrsquos Jamie Kennedy polled  votes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein now biggest party  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos chairman and vice-chairman were the high profile casualties of last weekrsquos local election.Following a marathon two-day count at Newry Leisure Centre, current SDLP chairman Mark Murnin lost out to his running mate Hugh Gallagher in Slieve Croob while his Sinn Fein deputy, Oksana McMahon, lost her seat in Crotlieve in an election of shocks and surprises.Overall, Sinn Fein emerged as the biggest party with  seats mdash up two from  mdash but it was a bad election for the SDLP which lost three of its most experienced councillors, Kate Loughran , Brian Quinnand Michael Carr .

But it wasnrsquot to be with only Hanlon getting over the line as Madden struggled to secure the transfers he needed to join her.A statement of intent by Republicans to secure three seats in The Mournes for the first time paid off with Sean Doran, Willie Clarke and Leeanne McEvoy elected, with the election of latter two confirmed shortly before am on Saturday.Sinn Fein were also bidding to secure three seats in Slieve Croob, but sitting councillor John Rice lost his seat, with Roisin Howell and Cathy Mason elected. Republicans were also disappointed at the loss of Ukrainian-born McMahon in Crotlieve amid suggestions by their political rivals that they had overstretched in this area.Despite McMahonrsquos loss, Gerry OrsquoHare and Mickey Ruane were elected in this DEA, while in Slieve Gullion it was almost a clean sweep with the party taking five of the seven available seats.The SDLP were mightily relieved to retain their three seats in Downpatrick with Gareth Sharvin topping the poll and joined by his colleagues Dermot Curran and John Trainor, the latter getting over the line thanks to UUP transfersBut the loss of council chairman Murnin to his party colleague, Hugh Gallagher, in Slieve Croob was a major blow for the party.The effervescent Terry Andrews secured his seat in Rowallane, but he missed out on topping the poll this time around and Laura Devlin was unable to take her running mate Brian Quinn over the line with her in The Mournes, much to the disappointment of the party. Quinnrsquos seat was one of a number Sinn Fein had targeted and successfully wrestled from the grasp of nationalists.Declan McAteer retained his seat in Crotlieve with former South Down MLA Karen McKevitt securing a seat. Pete Byrne recorded the third highest vote in Slieve Gullion but Loughran missed out despite polling , first preference votes.Alliance retained the two seats it held in Rowallane and Slieve Croob and came agonisingly close to pulling off a major shock in The Mournes where Andy McMurray, who had switched from Slieve Croob, came  votes short of denying Sinn Fein its hat-trick success.McMurray wasnrsquot given much of a chance as the party only polled  votes in , but he pulled in almost  first preferences as the Alliance surge across the Province had ripple effect across the district.Pundits had not predicted Brown topping the poll with some even suggesting that he could have been involved in a dogfight for the fth seat after the decision by Independent Martyn Todd to enter the fray. How wrong they were with him securing , first preference votes.Gregory Bain, who was defending the party seat in Slieve Croob, was ahead of Murnin by  first preference votes and this effectively kept the council chairman behind the eight ball for the remainder of the count.

Fintan Eastwood added his second score of the game after great work from Daacuteire Rooney in midfield.St Michaelrsquos came back at Holywood and some great work left Morgan free to slot the ball over the bar, but a terric block by St Paulrsquos defender Jonny Parsons prevented the score.St Paulrsquos gathered possession and transitioned the ball up to Niall Johnson, who again left his marker for dead and bore down on the St Michaelrsquos goal before passing to Seaacuten Tucker.However, he was fouled to stop him scoring a goal, but Eastwood tapped over the resulting free from m. Eastwood added his fourth point of a fantastic game for him after great work by Conleth Rooney to set him up.Tucker added a m free before the first goal of the game. Daacuteire Rooney won the resulting kick out and ran m at speed into heart of the St Michaelrsquos defence before passing the ball to Tucker.He danced past two defenders before slotting the ball past Gavin Marsden in the St Michaelrsquos net. Further points from Eastwood, Niall Johnson and a Tucker free left the score at half-time a lopsided - to -.St Michaelrsquos again came out strongly in the second half and dominated play for the first five minutes with John Kearney scoring from play and McIlduff adding another free.St Paulrsquos finally came out for the second half when Daacuteire Rooney ran at the St Michaelrsquos defence before slotting over a terric point from m. Not to be outdone, the industrious Ben Gray took himself on a similar run and had the same result as he slotted over a point.St Paulrsquos were forced into an early substitution in the second half with Daniel Eastwood, ing from Australia, replacing Rooney, who pulled up with a hamstring injury.Danielrsquos brother, Fintan, added to his score collection with another point before Rooney scored the best point of the game. The Lisburn Distillery soccer star won the ball in midfield before taking off on a m lung-bursting sprint with the ball before a neat one-two with Daniel Eastwood provided him the space to slot the ball over from m, much to the delight of the St Paulrsquos supporters.Daniel Eastwood then took centre stage proving what a great asset he is going to be for St Paulrsquos going forward as he scored the next three points all from play.Last seasonrsquos player of the year Daacuteire McGrattan came off the bench for Daacuteire Rooney showing the depth St Paulrsquos now have in the  and he quickly made his mark.After a St Michaelrsquos player was rightly yellow carded for a rash sliding tackle, St Paulrsquos took the free kick quickly and a marauding McGrattan took the ball at high speed and fought off the challenges before smashing it into the top corner of the St Michaelrsquos net. McIlduff continued to punish St Paulrsquos indiscretions by scoring five frees in the second half, but St Paulrsquos were too strong and Fintan Eastwood added to his man of the match performance with his seventh point of the game.Seaacuten Tucker rounded off the scoring with the last score of the game. A convincing win for the Holywood men, but in truth there were multiple chances for goals that were not taken and in the stronger tests to come, the St Paulrsquos lads are going to have to be much more clinical in taking those goal chances.St Paulrsquos: Craig McKenna, Owen Loughran, Conor McPeake, Johnny Parsons, Ruairi Collins, Paddy Falls, Ben Gray , Daacuteire Rooney , Gerard Walls, Fintan Eastwood , Seaacuten Tucker , Martin Cox, Oliver Monaghan, Conleth Rooney, Niall Johnston .

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I had hoped to work constructively with them and take their concerns on board.ldquoThose who were elected as Conservatives but have chosen to betray the faith that was shown in them by their constituents should have the courage to resign and face by-elections. They should defend their decisions at the ballot box.ldquoAn establishment stitch up between these councillors and Labour is not in the interest of residents of the Vale of Glamorgan. They have explicitly argued that they know best and that the public should be ignored.ldquoI will be proposing a minority Conservative administration at the Vale Councilrsquos AGM with a plan that delivers on the priorities of local people. I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

years in the business  ","story":"Edward Wilson CBE, Chairman of Ulster Carpets, has retired after over half a century at the leading luxury carpet manufacturer. Known for his diplomacy, patience and people skills, Edward – who is the son of company founder George Walter Wilson – steps down after  years, having played a pivotal role in making Ulster Carpets one of the province’s leading exporters and the largest single site producer of axminster and wilton carpet in the world. While he grew up around the business, Edward followed in the footsteps of his older brothers, Walter and John, and officially joined Ulster Carpets in . In the intervening years, he held many positions, including in sales and planning, before becoming Managing Director and then, eventually, Chairman. Recognised as an astute leader, he was well known for taking a daily tour of the business where he spoke to staff at every level and kept up-to-date on the latest orders and technological developments. Many of the current management team were personally mentored by Edward, including Group Managing Director  Deputy Chairman, Nick Coburn. Edward commented: “One of my greatest pleasures in le has been going into the factory and talking to our staff. As I have been reminded so many times, one of the biggest selling points of Ulster Carpets is our wonderful workforce – people who are passionate about what they do. “When my father started Ulster Carpets in , I’m sure he never thought that the company would still be here over  years later, employing people not just in Northern Ireland but across the world. For that success, I must pay tribute to our wonderful staff and that is something I take great pride in.” Despite this retirement, the Wilson family will remain at the helm of Ulster Carpets, with Edward’s nephews, Nick Coburn and John Wilson, as Group Managing Director and Chairman respectively. Paying tribute to Edward’s passion and devotion to Ulster Carpets, Nick Coburn said: “When I joined the company  years ago, it was Edward who mentored and guided me through every facet of our business. Since I became MD in , this bond and incredible support from Edward has been vital to ensuring the company has continued to prosper and develop. “As we look to the future, I would also like to highlight the outstanding work and dedication Edward has done to prepare the company - and the next generation of the Wilson family - for a secure and successful future.” John Wilson, who takes over as Chairman, added: “Edward is held in the highest esteem by the company, the industry and, of course, the whole Wilson family. Edward’s commitment to seeing the company evolve and constantly adapt to the inevitable challenges that comes with  years of business is one of the reasons why Ulster Carpets is such a great company and has been so successful. “His decision to step down from his role as Chairman is another challenge for the business but he leaves the company in a strong place.” Following his last meetings with shareholders and board members, Edward’s final act was an official event at the company’s Castleisland factory where staff had an opportunity to say a final farewell.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/border_1.jpg","title":"trusted trader status could help ni firms with brexit","story":"Posted on Monday May  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland exporters could avoid some of the damaging impact and friction of a hard Brexit by adopting the Government’s ‘trusted trader’ status, Ulster Business can reveal.According to Safeguard AEO, a firm which assists businesses in getting the green light for the so-called Authorised Economic Operatortrading quality mark, the global arrangement could help firms avoid heavy friction with trade, following Brexit.The status is a quality marker, which the Government says allows businesses to fast-track shipments through customs, and is something which could be crucialthe UK leaves the EU without a deal.And while such an arrangement has not yet been firmed up by the Government, Richard Thompson of Safeguard AEO believes it’s something which is seriously being considered.According to figures reported by the BBC,  applications for AEO were received between June  and January this year, with fewer than half the applications being approved.“It is dependent on the arrangement that is put in place between Dublin and say Belfast,” Mr Thompson says.“If you are moving stuff from the north to the south, then that accreditation will be recognised in the south, and those goods could just move .”The AEO is a global scheme, which was first introduced by the World Customs Organisation .The firm provides software and support to both small and large firms, taking them through a green, amber and red light system for the ious stages of the complex AEO system, ensuring each area meets the correct standards before the application is submitted.“Businesses should be thinking very seriously about getting this accreditation. Either, they will need it when we leave, or they will need itwe stay,” Mr Thompson said.The status applies primarily to physical goods being transported across customs areas, including manufacturers, agri-business and general retail.Martin Dubbey, managing director of Safeguard AEO, said: “The big concern is not just the Northern Ireland border with the Republic. You also have  HGVs coming out every day down to the port, and then across.“I think there has to be some sort of fudge .”Meanwhile, Karen Wheeler, who heads the UK Border Delivery Group, has told a group of businesses here that there is no magic technological solution for preventing a hard border in Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/gym_1.jpg","title":"new exercise business for city centre hotel","story":"Posted on Tuesday May  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest hotel will soon be punching well above its weight as a new exercise business sets up shop, Ulster Business can reveal.Fitness franchise Round has been growing in the UK at a steady pace, and will open its doors later this month at the Grand Central Hotel in Belfast city centre.Rather than running on a set schedule, a new Round session starts every three minutes, allowing a new workout every day, including a range of weight resistance, cardio and core-strength training.The company is one of the first brands in the UK to utilise wearable heart-rate technology, and class participants wear heart rate monitors, which are hooked up to a big screen in the gym.It’s understood Round Belfast will be opening in May .

Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"could a new dawn boost ni business development","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business While Brexit is still upon us, John Simpson says the business sectors finances have proved stronger than predicted and lending could be boosted on the outside as the veil of uncertainty lts The darkest hour comes just before the dawn: an apt reference to the prospects when Brexit is finally taken out of the daily diet of news, concern about business disruption, and foreboding about dficult trading prospects. Brexit is proving to be a slow departure. This year the economy has proved more resilient than many feared. Employment has remained at high levels, jobs for skilled employees are available, and with less certainty personal incomes have been maintained.Political uncertainty and efficient business management are an uneasy mix. In the recent winter and springbusinesses have had to live with an intense series of destabilising influences. For over  years, businesses in Ireland and the UK have grown accustomed to near frictionless EU market conditions. customs duties had disappeared on all internal EU trading. For businesses on this island, the memory of cross-border customs duties had all been but forgotten.   Looking at the lending performances of some of our own banks, the numbers seem to be adding up. In its full year accounts for , Danske Bank posted pre-tax profit of £.m, while new lending rose % and overall business lending increased by %.Across Donegall Square, Ulster Bank saw its income rising from £m to £m during , while profit after impairments stood at £m. There was a % rise in new corporate lending, while small business rose by %.Meanwhile, across the UK as a whole, Barclays has announced a £bn lending fund as part of a series of initiatives to help small and medium-sized businessesto succeed and flourish through Brexit and beyond.Only older colleaguescan remember the perils of railway journeys interrupted by a one hour stop at Goraghwood station, close to Newry, while all passengers were asked by customs officersthey had ‘anything to declare’. More affluent older travellers would more likely recall the cross-border queuing requirement for the predecessor of the ‘green card’ for cars. Today, the challenge is of how to deliver the political agreement that the border on this island should be either frictionless or non-existent as the UK plans to leave the EU. In the new era there will be redefined relations between NI and the Republic, within the framework of UK-EU relations. The important part lies in negotiations on working arrangements that have not yet officially started.For the remaining part of  and going into , the business scene might be described as getting ‘ready for le after Brexit’.In the last three years the business community which forms the core of the private sector in Northern Ireland has been trading successfully.  The evidence from local reviews of the larger profit making businesses has been encouraging. Year-on-year turnover has been increasing faster than inflation and, even more critically, profitability has been maintained and often improved.Work to identy how well locally owned and controlled businesses have performed has been reassuring. To be included in the review of the Top  more profitable Northern Ireland business, which will be published in more detail, the cut-off point has risen to just on £m annual pre-tax profits. In a further reassuring feature and in contrast to the preceding year, during the year  the number of business casualties fell to a very small number.While the overall performance of businesses in the private sector has been better than is sometimes appreciated, there is a mixture of features in the complex matrix of business performance. The evidence is often from personal subjective sources but the elements do point to a consistent pattern. Businesses have been trading, in general, with improved profits but with turnover rather less buoyant. Employment has been increasing, now more slowly, but pay rateshave not fully recovered from the fall in real earnings in the past decade. Interestingly at a regional and national level, changes in wage rates have not shown the boost of an inflationary increase that might have been expected when unemployment levels have fallen to near record lows.Bargaining in the labour market has been restrained, probably influenced by the siren voices of emerging problems as the Brexit withdrawal agreement has dominated the political and economic policy agenda. This points to the emergence of a contrast between the trend in overall business profitability, which has improved, alongside the trend for inidual personal incomes to lag behind the real levels of the past decade. To a modest degree, business profitability may have improved relative to changes in the costs of the payroll.While the scale of the dference should be treated with caution, as business evolves during the rest of , business finance may be better placed to activate improving investment plans.The post-Brexit business scene should be pointing to reduced uncertainty, even with some predictable new business obstacles, and a helpful change in government economic policy to incentivise faster economic expansion. That prospect, alongside a business sector that has a stronger capacity to invest and grow, makes the months ahead more encouraging than many experts expect.In summary, the business sector is understandably anxious to see aof greater business stability and, for a mixture of reasons, may now be more likely to implement more ambitious investment programmes. Add to this combination the possibility that official Government economic policy will be more flexibleand there is a hope that, out of the recent grey clouds of possible recession, there will be incentives leading to a more buoyant economy here.Just one moment of caution: the brightness of a new dawn in  may be dimmedthe political processes constrain the application of improved economic policies through a refreshed local administration. Business has been performing well, despite the huge levels of uncertainty. However, the political environment could drown out an improving economy. That challenge has not changed.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/graham_11.jpg","title":"word from the wise graham lapsley","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Graham Lapsley, head of private banking, Danske Bank How did you start out in business   Banking has always been in my blood as my father joined Belfast Banking Co Ltdin . As a boy I remember being in Northern Bank branches ‘helping out’ when my father was completing regular evenings doing overtime. This was an environment that I was familiar with, although I didn’t ever think I would make banking a career. In  I found myself in Limavady branch and thoroughly enjoyed branch banking at a time when there were no computers, no autobanks and lots of staff. I’ve benefited from lots of dferent roles at the Bank in my career, each bringing its own challenges. I left my role as head of personal credit last year to take up my current position as head of private banking. What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far On a personal level changing job roles always brought new challenges. Change is a constant which I accept and while I’ve worked in Danske Bank for  years I have had senior roles in branch banking, wealth management, business banking, risk management and now private banking.   As an area manager in branch banking, I found the leadership of the transition from Australian ownership to Danish ownership in  a huge challenge. This change was as exciting as it was challenging as we benefited from huge investment and the Dane’s leading edge technology. I didn’t go directly from school to university, but I’ve been lucky enough to have had employer support to complete a business studies degree and a masters’ degree in executive leadership.
