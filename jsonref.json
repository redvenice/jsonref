CIA Director John Brennan testifying before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearingJohn Brennan CIABrennan served with the Directorate of Intelligence (DI) before working for the State Department as a Political Officer at the US Embassy in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and went on to direct terrorism analysis at the Director of Central Intelligence’s Counterterrorism Center in the 1990s.According to Britannica, he then acted as the CIA’s daily intelligence briefer under former President Bill Clinton before serving as the agency’s chief of station in Saudi Arabia, as Chief of Staff to CIA Director George Tenet and the CIA’s Deputy Executive Director.Before retiring from the CIA in 2005, he led efforts for the formation of an organisation that would become the National Counterterrorism Centre and was an interim director. Brennan then took on a role as President and CEO of the Analysis Corporation and Chairman of the Board at the Intelligence and National Security Alliance, but this was short-lived.Following this, while former President Barack Obama found that he shared similar philosophies when it came to the CIA, Brennan’s involvement in enhanced interrogation techniques working under President George W. Bush, he was not appointed as head of the agency.          President Barack Obama and former Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel, listen to John BrennanInstead, Brennan was made Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism and Cyberattacks for around four years and in this role, helped to share US policy in response to a number of different events.He also oversaw the CIA’s use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, that were used to target terrorists in Pakistan and Yemen. However, this and his involvement in methods such as waterboarding during the Bush era were called into question with Obama nominated him to lead the CIA in 2013.Brennan said that he was against waterboarding and despite this, his appointment was approved by the Senate 63-34. As reported by Reuters, during his tenure, Brennan created ten new mission centres so that the CIA could focus on cyberthreats.In 2017, he also briefed Trump, along with James Comey, Mike Rogers and James Clapper, on the findings in regards to Russian election interference and the allegations contained in the Steele dossier, as reported by CBS News.Before he left office, Brennan was open about how he felt about the current US President and said: ‘I don\u0027t think he has a full appreciation of Russian capabilities, Russia\u0027s intentions and actions that they are undertaking in many parts of the world. Brennan stated that it was outrageous that Trump was equating the intelligence community with Nazi Germany”.’John Brennan is married to Kathy Pokluda Brennan, also of North Bergen and is the father of a son and twin daughters.John Brennan on TrumpJohn Brennan hit back at Trump after he ordered that his security clearance should be revoked and wrote that the President’s campaign had colluded with Moscow to win in the 2016 election. Trump said that this decision was made because of Brennan’s ‘erratic conduct’ and ‘outrageous allegations’, according to the BBC. Trump cited that the Department of Justice’s inquiry into Russia’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 US election was the reason why Brennan’s clearance was revoked.However, in the NYT piece that Brennan wrote, he said that his clearance was a politically motivated ‘attempt to scare into silence’ other critics of the President. He continued: ‘Mr Trump’s claims of no collusion are, in a word, hogwash.’Bachelor in Paradise 2018 spoilers: How much is Venmo John worth and who does he end up with?How much will Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding to Jack Brooksbank cost and who is paying for it?Fortnite challenges: Season 5 week 6 Where the Stone Heads are lookingWhy Princess Diana\u0027s engagement ring caused upset with the Royals Notting Hill Carnival 2018: Everything you need to knowAriana Grande Sweetener album: All you need to know Madonna music: Like A Virgin singer\u0027s best songs revealed on her 60th birthdayPornhub gives Indian users a week\u0026#8217s free membership on Independence DayFortnite update 1.72: Epic Games launch new PS4 and Android patch for v5.21 releaseAsian Games 2018: All you need to knowDele Alli celebration: How to do it and what does it mean?Guava Island: Are Rihanna and Childish Gambino starring in a film together?Who is Aishwarya Rai Bachchan?

It says they are being held by Hamas in Gaza.\u0027That\u0027s the only way,\u0027 Israeli Regional Cooperation Minister Tzachi Hanegbi, a member of Netanyahu´s security cabinet, said on Thursday when asked if a broad arrangement depended on the return of the soldiers\u0027 bodies.\u0027Nothing will be done to enable (Gaza\u0027s) significant rehabilitation and the improvement of infrastructure and ports and other such fantasies, unless they release the bodies and the two Israeli captives,\u0027 he told Israel radio.The Egyptian security source said the long-term truce would also envisage Israel freeing hundreds of detained Palestinians in a prisoner swap.However, the Palestinian official denied any talks were taking place on a swap, saying Hamas opposed mixing the issues.Egypt has brokered a Palestinian reconciliation agreement that provides for Hamas to cede control of Gaza to Abbas\u0027s Palestinian Authority. A dispute over power-sharing has hindered implementation of the deal, but the Egyptian source said Cairo was still seeking progress on the issue.

Around 2.9million in the UK are currently using the devices, with around 470,000 using them to stop smoking.Last month, anti-tobacco campaigners called on the Government to act to prevent a new kind of e-cigarette from taking off among children, as it has done already in America. The Juul vape pens offer flavours such as mango and glacier mint.In March this year, NICE said the long-term health impact of e-cigarettes ‘was still developing’ and there was ‘little evidence’ of their effectiveness or safety as medicinal products. A series of reports have highlighted how e-cigarettes still have many negative health effects. These include increasing the risk of the lung condition chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung damage and infection. Nicotine – which is contained in e-cigarettes – is itself an addictive substance that increases heart rate and blood pressure.The World Health Organisation is among bodies to call for stiff regulation of e-cigarettes and bans on their indoor use.However, Public Health England claimed recently that e-cigarettes are ‘95 per cent safer’ than conventional smoking.That claim is repeated in today’s report which said: ‘Regulations should be relaxed relating to e-cigarettes licensing, prescribing and advertising of their health benefits.’Chairman Norman Lamb added: ‘If used correctly, e-cigarettes could be a key weapon in the NHS stop-smoking arsenal.’The committee said that while ‘uncertainties’ remained about the long-term health impact of the devices, they presented ‘an opportunity to significantly accelerate already declining smoking rates’.          Scientists are warning that e-cigarette vapour as well as tobacco can cause lung damageThe MPs also called for ‘wider debate’ on vaping in public spaces. While vaping is not illegal inside pubs or restaurants, many major pub and restaurant chains such as Wetherspoons have imposed bans indoors as it is difficult from a distance to tell whether someone is smoking or vaping.The MPs urged that a tobacco product called ‘snus’ – which is taken in the mouth – is made legal in the UK, despite the fact it has previously been linked to oral cancer.Cancer Research UK said any changes to current e-cigarette regulations should be aimed at helping smokers to quit while preventing young people from starting to use e-cigarettes.The science and technology committee said it has considered evidence from more than 90 organisations including a range of academics, NHS professionals, NICE, and Government departments to inform its recommendations. John Dunne, for the UK Vaping Industry Association said the report was a ‘ringing endorsement of vaping’s public health potential’.  "},{"url":null,"title":"MAC sport","story":"    \u0027Our sport badly needs some publicity.

Former Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee is pictured above, in this May 2, 2004 file photo, greeting the audience at a ceremony at the Presidential Palace in New DelhiThe ex-PM was a lifelong poet who revered nature but who oversaw India\u0027s growth into a swaggering regional economic power. He was also the prime minister who ordered nuclear tests in 1998, stoking fears of atomic war between India and Pakistan. Then, a few years later, it was Vajpayee who made the first moves toward peace.Vajpayee\u0027s supporters saw him as a skilled politician who managed to avoid fanaticism a man who refused to see the world in black and white.But his critics considered him the leader of a fanatic movement - a movement partially rooted in European fascism – that sought power by stoking public fears of India\u0027s large Muslim minority.The one thing both sides could agree on was his honesty. Vajpayee was that rare person in Indian politics: untainted by corruption scandals.  Vajpayee\u0027s body was to be taken to his New Delhi home and then to the BJP\u0027s office on Friday for people to pay their last respects, ahead of his cremation this afternoon          This handout photograph released by India\u0027s Press Information Bureau on August 16 shows Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (right) laying a wreath next to the body of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vaajpayee in New DelhiOne of seven children of a schoolteacher in central India, Vajpayee joined India\u0027s Hindu revivalist political movement in his late 20s. Elected to Parliament in 1957, he became the best-known figure in its moderate wing, and helped the Bharatiya Janata Party become one of India\u0027s few national political parties.One of India\u0027s longest-serving lawmakers, Vajpayee was elected nine times to the powerful Lok Sabha, or lower house of Parliament. He also served two terms in the Rajya Sabha, or upper house.  A woman and a child watch as a man waits with a wreath to offer his respects to former Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee outside Bharatiya Janata party in New Delhi, IndiaVajpayee led the party to its first national electoral victory in 1996, but lasted just 13 days as prime minister before he resigned in the face of a no-confidence motion. He returned to power in 1998 for 13 months after forging an alliance of 22 parties, mostly regional power brokers with disparate local appeal, and again served as India\u0027s prime minister from 1999 to 2004.It was in India\u0027s relations with Pakistan where Vajpayee\u0027s influence may last the longest.While India\u0027s nuclear weapons program is believed to date to the 1980s, New Delhi had long insisted its atomic program was purely for peaceful purposes.           Vajpayee, a former journalist and poet turned politician, is credited with helping lay the foundations for the meteoric rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the political powerhouse that rules India today  In 2015, the government honored Vajpayee with the Bharat Ratna, India\u0027s highest civilian award, while his December 25 birthday was declared \u0027Good Governance Day\u0027 in a tribute to his leadership           Vajpayee, 93, died on Thursday in a New Delhi hospital where he was being treated for a kidney infection and chest congestionThat changed within a month of Vajpayee returning to the prime minister\u0027s post in 1998, when he approved a series of nuclear weapons tests that shocked the world and pushed Islamabad to launch its own tests.But the next year, when Islamabad sent fighters across the cease-fire line that ides the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir between the nations, Vajpayee resisted military pressure to launch a broad counter-attack of Indian forces.After 11 weeks and more than 1,000 deaths, Pakistan ordered the fighters to withdraw. India earned international praise for its caution.His peace efforts began with a groundbreaking bus ride to Lahore, Pakistan, in February 1999, where he met with then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. The diplomatic journey inaugurated the first regular bus service between the two nations.  In this April 25, 1996 file photo, the then Hindu nationalist party candidate for Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee greeted supporters and was showered with rose petals at a campaign rally in New Delhi, IndiaThen, just before leaving office in 2004, he launched a peace process that, while often rocky, remains the basis of ongoing negotiations.Vajpayee avoided bedrock nationalist issues, like plans to build a Hindu temple at the site of a demolished north Indian mosque. But critics excoriated him for failing to quickly quell anti-Muslim riots that shook the state of Gujarat in 2002. More than 1,100 people, almost all of them Muslim, were killed in the riots, which began after a train fire killed 60 Hindu pilgrims. Muslims were accused of setting the fire, though the true cause was never known.  The body of former Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, wrapped in the Indian national flag, is taken in full state honor to the Bharatiya Janata party office for people to pay their last tributes in New Delhi          The All India Institute of Medical Sciences, where Vajpayee had been hospitalised for more than two months with a kidney infection and chest congestion, announced his death. Vajpayee, a leader of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, had suffered a stroke in 2009Vajpayee\u0027s public response to the riots reflected his many contradictions.In the days after the pogrom, Vajpayee said he could not understand how Hindus could burn women and children alive, sadly asking a group of Muslim survivors: \u0027Have we lost our way so much that we cease to be humans?\u0027Just a year later, though, he told a mostly Hindu audience, \u0027Wherever there are Muslims in large numbers, they do not want to live in peace.\u0027While known for his poetry and gifted with a politician\u0027s common touch - as a parliamentarian he would take his dogs for walks in public – he was not known for public introspection. Few people could claim to understand what drove him. He never married, but lived with his adopted daughter, her husband and their daughter.  Former Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, a Hindu nationalist who set off a nuclear arms race with rival Pakistan but later reached across the border to begin a groundbreaking peace process, died Thursday after a long illnessVajpayee quickly dropped from sight after the BJP lost power to the long-dominant Congress party in 2004 elections. As his health failed, Vajpayee stayed out of the limelight even when the BJP returned to power a decade later and Narendra Modi became prime minister.Modi\u0027s government presented Vajpayee as an icon, seeking inspiration from his political career and cashing in on his stature and popularity as a statesman acceptable across political ides.\u0027It was Vajpayee\u0027s exemplary leadership that set the foundations for a strong, prosperous and inclusive India in the 21st century. \u0027His futuristic policies across various sectors touched the lives of each and every citizen of India,\u0027 Modi tweeted Thursday.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo extended his condolences in a statement praising Vajpayee\u0027s contributions to India and to the development of bilateral relations.

Elon Musk\u0027s tweet saying he was considering taking Tesla private has sparked controversyThe company could face sanctions if regulators find it misled investors about production delays.  Musk also came under fire during the rescue of 12 children from a cave in Thailand where officials dismissed his plan to save them with a miniature submarine created by his rocket company SpaceX.  The billionaire was forced to apologise to a British er who helped to rescue the boys after Musk labelled him \u0027pedo guy\u0027. He also came under fire when the Federal Election Commission released annual filings showing Musk as one of the top 50 donors to a political action committee dedicated to helping Republicans maintain control of the House.While Musk has described himself as \u0027half Democrat, half Republican\u0027 in the past, critics said it was hypocritical of a green energy CEO to donate nearly $40,000 to the GOP.  A month earlier, in May this year, it emerged that Musk had launched an extraordinary outburst during a quarterly earnings conference call.The billionaire branded one industry analyst a \u0027boring bonehead\u0027 during the bizarre session, saying another\u0027s \u0027questions are so dry they are killing me\u0027.  Elon Musk Confronts a Fateful Tesla Tweet and an ¿Excruciating¿ Year - The New York Times"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/17/07/4F2763C200000578-0-image-a-16_1534488130074.jpg","title":"British Airways flight declares mid air emergency way Ibiza","story":"    The flight took off from London Gatwick, then erting back there over the English ChannelThe plane was met by fire engines after landing back at Gatwick, it was claimed. The aircraft reached a maximum altitude of 18,000ft and a speed of 376 knots (432mph).Passenger Corin Baird tweeted: \u0027Thanks British Airways, held for an hour on the plane before take off, turn around and head back to LGW after 45 minutes for tech issues.Plane with 157 passengers on board slides off the runway and...Share this article\u0027And now held on a bus for 20 minutes before we can even get off to go into the terminal as no staff to greet us.

Sometimes the vagina is then cut open for sex or childbirth.Women sometimes bleed to death or can be left with horrifying health effects, such as infections, chronic pain, cysts, infertility and problems giving birth. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), FGM is carried out for social and religious reasons and is an \u0027extreme form of discrimination against women\u0027.FGM is estimated to lead to an extra one or two baby deaths per 100 deliveries worldwide.Women with FGM also have increased risk of stillbirth, infants that need resuscitation and low birth weight babies.Girl, 3, \u0027needed emergency surgery after botched FGM in London\u0027 | London Evening Standard"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/17/12/0001C09300000258-6070797-image-m-51_1534506290668.jpg","title":"Why Princess Dianas engagement ring caused upset Royals","story":"    Prince Charles and Diana Spencer at Buckingham Palace after announcing their engagementSince then, The Queen has worn the very same brooch at a number of public events. It was also reported that Diana picked out the jewel herself, while others claim that she chose it because it was the biggest and reminded her of her mother’s engagement ring.Princess Diana loved her engagement ring so much that she continued to wear it after her orce from Prince Charles in 1996 and it was made into a bracelet. She then started wearing an emerald-cut aquamarine ring in its place, the same one that Meghan Markle wore with her second wedding dress.          Princess Diana loved her engagement ring and continued to wear it after her orcePrincess Diana’s jewellery collectionGrant Mobley, a gemologist and Director at Pluczenik and one of the world’s leading diamantaires, said: ‘A beautiful ring that Princess Diana was seen wearing on her ring finger after her orce from Prince Charles was an emerald cut, aquamarine and diamond ring.He continued: ‘The Princess was very fond of a pearl and diamond bracelet featuring a large emerald cut aquamarine that she was given in her early years as a princess and, after her orce, she commissioned this matching ring to be made.‘Diana’s taste in jewellery was impeccable and the fact that she commissioned this ring to be made is a clear testament to her taste.           Meghan Markle seen here wearing Princess Diana\u0027s aquamarine ring to her wedding reception\u0027She always chose diamond jewellery that was meaningful to her - she was very intentional with her jewellery choices and made sure they were the best representation of those meaningful moments,’ he said, as reported in The Express.The aquamarine ring is thought to be around £75,000 because of the size, colour and quality of the centre diamond and a diamond from one of her rings was also used to make Meghan Markle’s engagement ring.Meghan Markle’s engagement ringDespite including a stone from Botswana and two diamonds from Princess Diana’s personal collection, Meghan Markle’s engagement ring was compared to one available from Argos for just £33.

An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed Kamel had met with Netanyahu in Israel this week, but gave no details.Corbyn says he was \u0027standing up for democracy\u0027 by making...Share this articleA Palestinian source in Ramallah said Kamel has left without seeing Abbas, who had been preoccupied with a Palestinian leadership conference. But the source said Abbas had informed Egypt that Fatah representatives would join the Cairo talks later this week or next week.Apart from the opening of its Kerem Shalom commercial crossing into Gaza, Israel also expanded the enclave\u0027s fishing zone, in waters under Israeli naval blockade, from three to nine nautical miles off the southern coast and to six nautical miles in the north, according to the head of Gaza\u0027s fishermen\u0027s union.The Egyptian security source said the extended truce would also include opening a sea lane from Gaza to Cyprus under Israeli supervision.A Palestinian official in Gaza familiar with the talks said Palestinian factions were demanding a \u0027total lifting of the blockade on Gaza, opening all crossings with Israel and Egypt and a water corridor\u0027.Israel says its blockade is a self-defence measure against Hamas, a group that has called for its destruction.Israel\u0027s security cabinet, a forum of senior ministers headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, discussed the Gaza situation on Wednesday and an Israeli \u0027diplomatic official\u0027 said Hamas would have to prove its commitment to the truce.          Hamas representaive in Lebanon Oussama Hamdan (R) listens to Abbas Zaki, representative of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO)in LebanonAs well as wanting calm along the border, Israel has said Hamas must return the remains of two soldiers killed in the 2014 Gaza war and release two civilians whose fate is unknown. It says they are being held by Hamas in Gaza.\u0027That\u0027s the only way,\u0027 Israeli Regional Cooperation Minister Tzachi Hanegbi, a member of Netanyahu´s security cabinet, said on Thursday when asked if a broad arrangement depended on the return of the soldiers\u0027 bodies.\u0027Nothing will be done to enable (Gaza\u0027s) significant rehabilitation and the improvement of infrastructure and ports and other such fantasies, unless they release the bodies and the two Israeli captives,\u0027 he told Israel radio.The Egyptian security source said the long-term truce would also envisage Israel freeing hundreds of detained Palestinians in a prisoner swap.However, the Palestinian official denied any talks were taking place on a swap, saying Hamas opposed mixing the issues.Egypt has brokered a Palestinian reconciliation agreement that provides for Hamas to cede control of Gaza to Abbas\u0027s Palestinian Authority. A dispute over power-sharing has hindered implementation of the deal, but the Egyptian source said Cairo was still seeking progress on the issue.

Around 2.9million in the UK are currently using the devices, with around 470,000 using them to stop smoking.Last month, anti-tobacco campaigners called on the Government to act to prevent a new kind of e-cigarette from taking off among children, as it has done already in America. The Juul vape pens offer flavours such as mango and glacier mint.In March this year, NICE said the long-term health impact of e-cigarettes ‘was still developing’ and there was ‘little evidence’ of their effectiveness or safety as medicinal products. A series of reports have highlighted how e-cigarettes still have many negative health effects. These include increasing the risk of the lung condition chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung damage and infection. Nicotine – which is contained in e-cigarettes – is itself an addictive substance that increases heart rate and blood pressure.The World Health Organisation is among bodies to call for stiff regulation of e-cigarettes and bans on their indoor use.However, Public Health England claimed recently that e-cigarettes are ‘95 per cent safer’ than conventional smoking.That claim is repeated in today’s report which said: ‘Regulations should be relaxed relating to e-cigarettes licensing, prescribing and advertising of their health benefits.’Chairman Norman Lamb added: ‘If used correctly, e-cigarettes could be a key weapon in the NHS stop-smoking arsenal.’The committee said that while ‘uncertainties’ remained about the long-term health impact of the devices, they presented ‘an opportunity to significantly accelerate already declining smoking rates’.          Scientists are warning that e-cigarette vapour as well as tobacco can cause lung damageThe MPs also called for ‘wider debate’ on vaping in public spaces. While vaping is not illegal inside pubs or restaurants, many major pub and restaurant chains such as Wetherspoons have imposed bans indoors as it is difficult from a distance to tell whether someone is smoking or vaping.The MPs urged that a tobacco product called ‘snus’ – which is taken in the mouth – is made legal in the UK, despite the fact it has previously been linked to oral cancer.Cancer Research UK said any changes to current e-cigarette regulations should be aimed at helping smokers to quit while preventing young people from starting to use e-cigarettes.The science and technology committee said it has considered evidence from more than 90 organisations including a range of academics, NHS professionals, NICE, and Government departments to inform its recommendations. John Dunne, for the UK Vaping Industry Association said the report was a ‘ringing endorsement of vaping’s public health potential’.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/17/11/4F277F6400000578-6069939-A_torn_off_engine_pod_from_the_Xiamen_Air_plane_is_seen_besides_-a-7_1534502142338.jpg","title":"Chinese plane 157 passengers board slides runway Manila","story":"    Officials believe the plane \u0027misapproached\u0027 the runway on its first attempt to land, then lost contact with the control tower          A torn-off engine pod from the Xiamen Air plane is seen besides the runway after the accident The incident occurred in heavy rain and passengers and crew used an emergency chute to leave the aircraft.Local television network ABS-CBN later aired photos of a group it said were passengers from the flight wrapped in blankets as they lined up inside the passenger terminal.Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported the plane circled the airport for an hour before attempting to land.The aircraft is still resting on its belly near the end of the airport\u0027s main runway where it came to a stop after the accident, which occurred late on Thursday evening.

The vehicle, already overloaded with passengers, was caught in gridlocked traffic and sat static for nearly an hour. There was a heatwave, with a temperature of about 38C (100F) outside inside the bus it was 42C (108F). “At a specific moment, I just snapped,” remembered Ayari. “I got out in the middle of traffic to finally breathe.” Since then, he has been inclined to panic attacks if in confined, crowded spaces during hot weather.A month earlier, approximately 2,000 km (1300 miles) away in Bristol, UK, Adam Corner was on a bus with his partner and their new baby, heading across the city to visit friends. The bus was held up in traffic – not for long, but long enough. “It became a kind of inferno,” said Dr Corner, research director at Climate Outreach their baby, barely a month old, started screaming in a way Corner had never heard before. “We had a little insight into this immediate, visceral risk – you see it through the eyes of your newborn child.” He pulled the bus’s emergency cord and they jumped off into traffic.This tale of two bus journeys tells a story of rising temperatures and the pressure they are putting on cities and the people who live in them. Asked by  Cities to share their experiences for a week-long series on urban heat, readers from countries as disparate as Hawaii, the Netherlands, Australia, Denmark, Japan, France, Malaysia, Romania, South Korea and Canada expressed concern about the impacts already being felt.“When I moved here many years ago, we used to joke: ‘This summer happened on a Wednesday in Paris’,” wrote Mariann Gyorke. “That’s not the case anymore.” In an effort to preserve the cooler temperatures inside her family’s top-floor apartment, she had been cooking only cold dishes and shielding the windows with makeshift shutters made of cardboard.Around the world, people altered their behaviour and adapted their schedules to cope with the heatwave. In order to sleep, Michele Howie of Sydney soaked her nightwear in water and lay on a towel in front of two fans. Anna Mastersson in Mariehamn, of Finland’s Åland Islands, said her relative had been forced to buy a new car with air conditioning and a roof window: “In this weather and having to drive two small kids, she had no choice.” In her neighbourhood, dogs were being taken out later at night, for shorter walks. In Montreal, Frederic Hore had noticed people lingering in pedestrian passageways of the metro station to catch the pulse of cool air created by passing trains.Outside, green spaces dried up, with follow-on effects for agriculture and often the economy. Inge Kersten wrote of Nijmegen, this year’s European Green Capital, “Leaves are falling in our lovely green city”. On her family’s organic farm near Aarhus, Denmark, Jessica Tamminga had watched fields turn from green to brown: “The trees are turning yellow like it’s fall”. But for the impact on her business, she said, the heat was “rather pleasant – except for the disconcerting feeling that this California summer doesn’t belong in Scandinavia.”Britons, in particular, seemed more ready to take the warmer temperatures at face value. “We’re all enjoying a real summer at last,” wrote Regan Armitage. “Everyone seems uncharacteristically happy in Leeds.” Frank Holt in Brighton described the summer as “luxuriating, joyful, a little alcoholic, a summer you don’t need to go away for”. “It’s wonderful not moaning about the weather,” he wrote, adding that the ’s call-out had seem “designed to gain negative replies”.Holt expanded to  Cities by phone that, though he was concerned by climbing temperatures, he felt the onus was on scientists and the media to persuade politicians to act, he said in the meantime, the warmer weather “did have some enjoyable aspects”. “I think things sometimes should be enjoyed for what they are. This summer has been very good for Brighton.”And not all life was suffering in the heat. Jellyfish numbers had increased in the tropical seas around Jeju Island, wrote In-Gyum Kim from Seogwipo, its second-largest city. Helena in Columbia, South Carolina, said that judgin gby how often she was bitten, ticks and mosquitoes seemed to be thriving, as were “our famous Palmetto bugs” – cockroaches. In Kuala Lumpur, a bumper crop of the prized durian fruit saw prices come down to RM5 (£1) per kilo – but that had its own, unusual effect.The fruit is understood to raise the body’s temperature, said Vanessa Ting, a student in the Malaysian capital. “I ate three pieces and spent the rest of the day sweaty and uncomfortable, despite taking six showers.” At the pharmacy where she works part time, more customers had been reporting fevers, sore throats and coughs, attributed variously to the weather and durian. And she’d observed more retirees opting to meet at the McDonald’s where she regularly studied, rather than in more traditional coffee shops without air conditioning.  Cody Winchester had noticed more air conditioners being installed on more buildings in Honolulu. “People used to just open their windows and the fresh tropical breeze would pass through and cool the home. Now it’s unbearable to live in town without AC.” But many could not afford it, he added, as Hawaii has the most expensive electricity in the entire US.Many found their homes simply not built to cope with extreme temperatures. Adina wrote of Timisoara, Romania, that given its reliance on concrete and tarmac “the city becomes a frying pan in the heat”. Clive Warner, in Monterrey in northern Mexico, was opting to move 25km south to Santiago, Nuevo Leon, a greener area that is, on average, 5C cooler. “Having cardiac problems, I can’t tolerate it any longer,” he said of the 34-37C (93-99F) maximum shade temperature in Monterrey. “If it gets much hotter I don’t see how the place will be survivable in summer.”The electricity already sometimes fails in 39C (102F) heat, he added. “If that happens, I get in the car and drive to a shopping mall.”Air conditioning brought relief, but to a point that seemed drastically, even dangerously, at odds with ecology, said Tim Kelly in Naha, Japan. “Stores leave their front doors wide open, people enter and exit rooms without closing the door behind them – all the while blasting their air conditioning.” People even napped in their parked cars with the engines running.Not only was this dependance on air conditioning damaging to the environment, but moving regularly between radically different climes causes temperature shock, said Kelly. “Their bodies lose the ability to cope with the natural environment.” Johanna MacGregor said summer colds were common in Tokyo because shops, restaurants and the subway were often too cool, “while places like schools or community halls often have no aircon whatsoever – it’s one or the other.”It was in stark contrast to the picture painted by Patrycja Lickiewicz of Castalla in Alicante, Spain, as a society “in tacit compliance with nature”. There it is the norm to restrict activities to before 8.30am and after 8pm and to drink water, dress appropriately, and stick to the shade at all other hours. “No matter the temperatures people always behave the same way,” said Lickiewicz. “We do not complain, we just follow the same simple routines. When common sense prevails we keep ourselves and the environment in check.”But adapting is not simply a case of being sun-smart, Lickiewicz conceded, when at least the oldest buildings in Castalla are built of stone, with internal air flow directed through courtyards and shutters – which manages heat without the need for air conditioning.If cities are to cope with more extreme heat more frequently, there needs to be structural change across the board: building codes to ensure future housing stock is not only warm, but cool infrastructure that can cope and regulation to enforce safe behaviours. Harry May, in Fukuoka, Japan, wanted to see work shut down when the mercury climbs past 34C (“Think on that, the UK”) Monica Garcia-Galvan was in favour of introducing a water tax in Montreal to encourage people not to let taps run for minutes at a time (“if English people saw how Canadians wash dishes, they would faint”). Adina, in Timisoara, Romania, said authorities needed to enforce health and safety laws relating to working in unsafe temperatures: “We have them but no one respects them.” Alice Browning of Friedrichshafen, southern Germany, spoke for many with her desperate plea for more trees: “We really don’t want to be cooped up inside all day.”In many cities steps have already been taken. In Nantes, Patrick Brown said, boulevards cleared for cars were being redesigned to include plenty of green space, and art installations with water features had given people places in which to cool off in summer. The De Bastei centre operated a scheme in Nijmegen and elsewhere in the Netherlands where residents could swap tiles or stones from their garden for plants.Others saw opportunities to be grasped by tackling the rising temperatures. David Fraire said nothing could be done to ease the issue of heat in Chandler, Arizona. “This is Phoenix, valley of the sun – it comes with the territory.” But it could be better harnessed: “We should be using this heat to our advantage and convert all our power to solar source.” Frank Holt suggested that Britain could build its new, post-Brexit identity through investment in renewables.But even in amongst optimism there was a feeling of powerlessness, even fatalism. Washington DC residents would cope with the heat as they had done for decades, said Cara – but related issues, for example surrounding health problems and food insecurity, were a bigger unknown. “We’re already putting in more green, solar, or light-coloured roofs. We’re committed to keeping and increasing the tree canopy, too, to help lower temperatures.”But without greater commitment to addressing the root causes from regional authorities – for example, by shutting down the coal-fired power plants along the Potomac – Cara continued: “there is very little we can do”. Charlie in Redding, California, urged that the US “stop with the knuckle dragging” and return to the Paris climate accord and “thinking people” at once – if it was not already too late. The day he wrote, it was nearly 43C (109F): “Think that life as we have known it forever is on a collision course with a destiny that’s not beneficial for mankind!”Dr Adam Corner of Climate Outreach said adapting to climate change meant seeing its influence in every facet of life – not just the environment, and not just in high-profile periods of extreme weather. “It’s a really complex set of questions, but those tangible things are more relatable to people than ‘global temperatures are going to change by 2C’,” he said. “There are so many ways that climate change is with us now. It’s very much not a problem for the next generation – we need to be thinking about how we get to grips with it.”The effects and implications of rising temperatures need to be considered by doctors, urban planners, architects those working in business, transport, agriculture and food security. Yet even news stories about climate change were illustrated with photographs of polar bears and melting ice caps, or renderings of future cities. “It’s the human story of our generation, but you wouldn’t know it, from the way we visualise and present it. Where are the people in this?”In Nabeul, said Ayari, they were mostly indoors, sheltering in the air conditioning. Traffic had become unbearable and it was too hot even to go to the beach. His twin sister has a respiratory condition exacerbated by the heat and had been advised to stay indoors: “The doctors say it’s like an allergy to the weather,” said Ayari. “People are actually getting scared of going out and being confronted by the sun. You have empty streets in the daytime and huge crowds at night.“This heatwave we are witnessing is making me more and more concerned about our future in the city ... We have to talk more about the seriousness of this issue.” Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36fbbd4131b441f3f268a06bcd744559ff7eea3b/0_0_3865_2576/master/3865.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=34ece003c63855353ea81637b191f499 960w","title":"hot summer archaeologists forgotten gems","story":"We buckle in, the engine roars to life, and we begin creeping across the airfield wings wobble alarmingly with acceleration, then that stomach-dropping lurch pulls us away from the ground. Rising skywards, nervousness distils to anticipation for the priceless views of the great Clun-Clee ridgeway in south-west Shropshire. It’s 2003, deep in AE Housman country and my first experience of aerial archaeology. My undergraduate dissertation was exploring the meagre record for the last prehistoric hunter-gatherers of the region, and I wanted to see the lie of the land. Flying over swelling hills I’d pored over in cartographic form and trudged across on foot was exhilarating, even though we didn’t discover any new sites that year.If we’d gone up this summer, it might have been a different story. Right across the country, hundreds of archaeological sites are literally transpiring from the soil, as grass and crops become desiccated after months without rain. Deeper soils hold on to moisture longer, so plants growing over buried features such as ditches, walls or even old flowerbeds will dry out at different rates. Archaeologists have quietly spent decades developing a whole gamut of “remote-sensing” methods that allow us to visualise the skin-thin layer of sediments covering Britain’s bedrock. Its wrinkles and lumps contain our deep history written across fields, meadows and hills.We can detect the subtle changes in topography that mark eroded remnants of ancient landscapes with hi-tech methods, ranging from thermal mapping to laser scanning, against which even thick conifer forest is no match. Yet despite all this, sometimes nothing at all is visible under normal conditions. It’s only during severe droughts that sub-surface features reveal themselves as contrasting “parchmarks” in vegetation, offering a sort of full-wavelength time travel. Instead of tuning into one chronological frequency, many millennia materialise en masse a choral motet of history whose notes are ordinarily shrouded beneath the soil.Farmers and wildlife have been suffering hardship during the hot and dry summer, but archaeologists are dealing with a bumper crop of ancient markings revealing in astonishing detail just how much lies under our feet. Parchmarks can show normally hidden surroundings at existing sites, from once-fashionable garden designs to long-levelled outbuildings. But they are also famous for “unknown unknowns”: features that have never been seen until someone flies over a particular field during a dry spell. Sometimes their form gives them away: Roman forts tend to be square with rounded corners, while some iron age settlements have distinctive banjo-shaped outlines. Confirmation needs ground-truthing, which might come far in the future, but the ability to map sites not only gives us more historical information, it also records our heritage for protection.And it’s not just constructions that are manifesting themselves. The aridity of wilting leaves is inverted as once-vanished landforms revive: ghosts of hedgerows mark where butterflies flitted and nestlings hid, showing how our fields used to be on a smaller, more wildlife-friendly scale just a few decades ago. Across the floodplains, vanished ribbons of streams are arrayed across the land, taunting today’s corseted, managed rivers, and reminding us that elemental forces can rise again.The heatwave seven years ago led to more than a thousand new sites being found. This summer – the most prolonged drought since the 1970s – promises to be even more fruitful, and aerial discoveries right now are stratospheric, thanks to pilots in cockpits, as well as at the controls of drones: the newest kit in the toolbox for archaeologists.These ancient apparitions across the country are exciting yet strangely unsettling, dragging us out of our temporal bubble like some gigantic augmented reality overlay. Spectral pleasure gardens where silken skirts dragged (and servants snatched a rest) loom in front of great houses, only their windows remembering the view. Out in the fields, harvesters gathering crops travel over abraded burial mounds, encircling millennia-old bones and ashes. And those extinct watercourses rippling up through dry pasture were the veins of a once wild land – the routeways Britain’s hunter-gatherers knew. The parchmarks emerging remind us that most human life, love and toil in this land has been forgotten: not castles or stone circles, but age on age of the small things, hidden places, lost pathways. Archaeology connects us – if only for a long, hot season – with an entire world beyond memory.• Becky Wragg Sykes is an archaeologist based in north Wales, co-founder of TrowelBlazers, and author of Kindred: Neanderthal Life, Love, Death and Art, to be published by Bloomsbury Sigma in 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce1f8bf7a853b9faf69678b9ab4bdcbc92d8500e/0_36_3384_2031/master/3384.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d064ac96229c6557a6bd15226af9db1c","title":"instagram influencers advertising youtube vloggers kardashians","story":"When is an ad not an ad? When it works so well you don’t actually know that it is one? As in so many areas of life, regulators are scrambling to catch up with a digital world. The Competition and Markets Authority is investigating whether certain social media stars are properly declaring whether they are being paid to endorse products or services. This is mostly done by that mysterious elite level of sub-Kardashian mutants otherwise know as Instagram influencers who flaunt their curves, teeth whiteners, fitness programmes and posh herbs that give you “energy”.I, of course, am not influenced by any of these things. I am beyond all that, a superior being untouched by advertising, though only yesterday I clicked on a Facebook ad for something called a “Neck Wand” because I was bemused by what it would be. Mostly at my age the algorithms seem to think I would like to wear clothes that resemble floral burqas and shoes that medieval monks would refuse. Instagram is not my thing either. Since I lost my password I only follow two people: a friend who likes gardening and Sleaford Mods, so all I see is flowers and swearing, which is nice.Yet of course I know Insta is where it is at, and watching my teen and her mates it’s been clear for years that the vloggers of YouTube are the big stars. They sell themselves as a brand, reveal their hauls and make millions in doing so. If they dye their hair pink they don’t even need to mention the product.These old notions of branding and product placement have morphed into something that is everyday and ubiquitous. Social media is a world of advertisements for ourselves, for each other – it is just not called that. Asking celebrities to declare what they are paid to promote seems fair. Regulators, then, are looking for transparency – or that old-fashioned notion, accountability.But I fear it’s too late, as the ways social media has changed advertising have already happened. Old-fashioned adverting is in decline. The days of the memorable TV ad are gone, they are often very low-quality and basic. As TV channels proliferate, you can see they can hardly fill the ad spaces.Morally, yes, celebs and the banal influencers should be upfront about what they are doing, but that’s a bit like asking them to be honest about their no-makeup looks when they have heads full of Botox and self-promotion and profit margins. They are the product. We are the consumers. Yet social media means we are both the market and the content providers. It’s confusing out there. No wonder we are all selling ourselves short.The adage about advertising being the famous four Ps – product, place, price and promotion – has changed, according to Brian Fetherstonhaugh of the branding agency OglivyOne: it’s now the four Es: “experience, everyplace, exchange and evangelism”. The regulation of everyplace is, as we have seen with Facebook, proving difficult. The regulation of evangelism even more so. The duck pout, the long straight hair, the abs, the wellness loons, the appetite suppressants once promoted by Kim Kardashian – this is religious stuff. Do you believe you need to look like someone off Love Island? Well, here you go …As ever, what needs to happen here is not just regulation but education. Much derided media studies classes that taught us how to deconstruct adverts need now to be taught from very young, so that kids recognise when they are being sold to.Right now, the most effective advertising is advertising that denies that it is advertising. This is on a par with fake news. But too many of us buy it anyway."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8952af7309acc6edfa0414f42ff4c44367c2c261/0_234_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c408adf499e7c9c4dfe7862c8455a6cd","title":"stone stacking instagram environment adventure tourism","story":"They stand by the sea at Lindisfarne. You’ll find them in the glens of Skye, in Slovenian gorges, on the peaks of Chamonix, Barbadian beaches, American national parks and Australian creeks. Stacks of stones, miniature monuments made by enraptured visitors and photographed for posterity are tiny tributes to human industry, our desire to make a mark, and our deep love of special places. But what appears a completely benign form of play in the natural world has become a plague.Of course, stone-stacking is an ancient and sometimes religious impulse. A cairn in Scotland is a memorial to someone lost, but also a pile of stones that marks a way through wild country: invaluable when the cloud comes down. Cairns keep us safe.More recently, stone-stacking has become an art form and a competitive sport. Artists say the absorbing process of handling and balancing cool stones is meditative and good for our mental health. Children love it.But what Hourston’s critics don’t seem to grasp is the almost industrial scale of this new age of stone-stacking. Adventure tourism and social media have created a perfect storm of stones. Cruise ships decant hundreds of visitors on to once remote islands such as Orkney, the Faroes or Iceland, each passenger burning with a creative desire to memorialise their sightseeing on Instagram. “Where do you draw the line?” wonders Hourston. “Orkney, Shetland, Iceland, Svalbard, or the Antarctic peninsula? We should start drawing the line now.”Our personal monuments turn empty landscapes into peopled places. When we reach a remote summit or deserted beach, we know people have stepped there before, but for a moment we can enjoy a place where humans do not predominate.No longer. A forest of stacked stones destroys all sense of the wild. Stacks are an intrusion, enforcing our presence on others long after our departure. It’s an offence against the first and most important rule of wild adventuring: leave no trace.Stone-stacking in the wrong place can potentially mislead us on a misty moor. It can also harm wildlife. Birds such as oystercatchers make their nests on stony shores. These superbly camouflaged scrapes are almost impossible to see, and stone-stackers can destroy a nest in the breeding season without even knowing it. On other sites the moving of stones exposes soil and exacerbates erosion, destroying the cool undersides of stones that are sanctuaries for millions of invertebrates.Hourston was particularly struck by the multitude of stacked stones on Skaill beach, immediately below the neolithic village of Skara Brae. It’s not fanciful to fear that ancient ruins may be disturbed. Historic England last year warned that stone-stacking was putting at risk historic monuments such as neolithic Stowe’s Pound in Cornwall. We can be prosecuted for stone-stacking – destroying an ancient monument – in the wrong place.Is there ever a right place? I’d say yes. A stack of stones below the high-tide line on a well-visited beach is as harmless and ephemeral as a sandcastle. Just as there are graffiti walls, we could designate certain beaches or moors as permitted places for stone-stacking. Stone-stacking contests are obviously fun too.Those who find stone-stacking self-absorbed and narcissistic may have a point. But stone-stacking in the wrong place is mostly just thoughtless.Some will rail against more rules, or more self-restraint but we need both, particularly when there are more than 7 billion of us. Sheer quantities of people turn inconsequential behaviour into acts with consequences. If we want to enjoy what’s left of our wild world, we have to be more aware than ever of our impact upon this Earth.• Patrick Barkham writes for the  on natural history"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/495be7cc8998840d67fe69cc892f561277a83d84/59_253_3323_1993/master/3323.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fce4ca0e14ccf35ea1a1423a64bf47d","title":"a level results raise policy questions but first lets recognise achievement","story":"Despite the upheaval of the redesigned qualifications, many trends persistWe all know coverage of exam results day is fairly formulaic. Pictures of teenagers jumping up in the air clutching pieces of paper, stories about twins with a string of A*s who are now off to Cambridge, and a parade of people trying to explain all the changes that have happened that year and how it is now all different to before.Students receiving their A-level results on Thursday will be the first to do so in the latest wave of redesigned qualifications in England. The changes, which began during Michael Gove’s tenure at the Department for Education, mean a move away from modular qualifications and coursework towards linear assessment at the end of two years of study – largely through examinations.This year, subjects such as geography, modern foreign languages and music join the likes of English, the sciences, and art and design in being assessed in this way. The new qualifications are designed to better meet the needs of universities and employers.Despite the changes, many of the trends that we have seen in recent years persist. Girls continue to outperform boys in most subjects, the notable exceptions being mathematics and chemistry. There are large disparities in entry rates, around four-fifths of entries to physics are from boys, in English literature just one-fifth are.For many students, results day will be less about reflecting on what they have achieved and more about determining what happens next – whether they go to university, which university they will attend, and which course they will take. But for a growing number of students that uncertainty was removed long before they opened their results.This inevitably raised concerns that without the incentive of meeting a university offer, some students may not strive for the highest grades possible. That may well have happened in some cases, but at a national level the proportion of entrants achieving an A* or A is largely unchanged, although there has been a slight dip in the very highest grade. It does however, raise questions about how our universities admissions system should operate.But overall these are concerns for policymakers.

It’s a joy to come across Veja who have the whole package,” said Lisa Aitken, the retail fashion director at Net-a-Porter, which began stocking the label in January. The online retailer also stocks Budapest-based Nanushka, which was established by the London College of Fashion graduate Sandra Sandor in 2005 and introduced a £460 machine-washable quilted vegan leather jacket (£460) in its pre-autumnwinter 2018 collection.According to Rachael Stott, the senior creative researcher at The Future Laboratory, who notes “a global boom in plant-based lifestyles”, Gen Z is “a key driving force” in the demand for vegan alternatives. “They are conscious shoppers who want to know where and how their products are made and are actively using social media to cultivate a new dialogue around sustainability issues. As a result, they are voting with their wallets and are buying goods aligned with their ethics.”Several companies have made headway with vegan alternatives. Stott cites Pinatex, which has created a mass-market synthetic leather made from pineapple leaf fibres - a byproduct of the pineapple harvest - and Modern Meadows, which has developed bio-fabricated leather made from a genetically-engineered strain of yeast that produces animal collagen. She also notes that the material MycoWorks, which is grown from mycelium, the vegetative mushrooms tissue, “is not only sustainable, it can also be grown to almost any size and shape with a customised texture”.The trend should, however, be pursued with caution, she says. “Fashion brands should be commended for taking steps towards a cruelty-free supply chain, but the elimination of all animal products, regardless of whether they are ethically sourced, sends out a confusing message … It can give rise to low-value synthetic alternatives such as plastic-based PVC or ‘pleather’, which harbours its own environmental and ethical issues. “The manufacturing processes used to create these involve toxic chemicals and cause pollution in surrounding rivers and landfill sites. Currently there is no safe way to produce or dispose of PVC products, therefore consumers can be misled into thinking ‘vegan’ is entirely environmentally friendly.”Until now, Stella McCartney, who has never used animal products in any of her collections, has been the most famous advocate of vegan materials in the fashion industry. Her bestselling vegan-leather Falabella bag, which currently retails for £720, has remained on the top 10 must-have fashion lists since its inception in 2010. Other luxury brands, such as Barcelona-based M2Malletier, have also come up with alternatives to traditional materials. Its first vegan leather collection, which has just launched with prices starting at £475, aims to offer a “cruelty-free choice for the conscious shopper, as well as aiming to use sustainable leather-free manufacturing to curb deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions from farming cattle”, according to a spokesperson for the brand.

The bean stringer came out for a few weeks a year. Stringing beans would always be Dad’s job, because he loved them (still does). That bean stringer has now migrated to my kitchen and recently I’ve been stringing beans for dinner most nights. The two stand-out things I’ve made are a Keralan runner bean curry, and some buttery, soft runner beans cooked under a layer of olive oil, which a Turkish friend, Rosie, used to make us.This a quite a dry curry based very loosely on a thoran, but mine has a bit more sauce than a traditional thoran to suit British tastes. If you have the time and the inclination, you could use a fresh coconut and grate it, in place of the desiccated coconut – the resulting flavour will be worth it.1 onion, peeled and roughly chopped2 green chillies1 small thumb ginger, peeled and roughly chopped2 garlic cloves, peeledCoconut or vegetable oil1 tsp turmeric2 tsp cumin seeds3 tsp coriander seeds, bashed in a mortar1 x 400ml tin coconut milk50g unsweetened desiccated coconut, soaked in cold water for a minimum of 20 minutes 400g potatoes, chopped into bite-size pieces400g runner beans, destringed and sliced at an angle into 2cm lengths1 tbsp black mustard seeds1 handful curry leaves (optional)1 lemonTo serve1 green chilli, chopped1 small bunch coriander, choppedCooked brown or white rice4 roti or chapatisSalted dairy-free yoghurtPickles and chutneyFirst put the onion, chilli, ginger and garlic in a blender with two tablespoons of water and blitz to a paste. If you don’t have a blender, just finely chop everything.Heat a tablespoon of oil in a deep pan, add the onion mixture and cook for 10 minutes on a medium heat, until you have a thick, fragrant paste, adding a little more water if it’s beginning to stick before it’s cooked.Next, add the turmeric, cumin and coriander and cook for two minutes until they give off a toasted aroma, then add the coconut milk, desiccated coconut and potatoes. Fill the coconut milk tin with water and add this too, along with a good pinch of salt. Simmer for 15-20 minutes, until the potatoes are cooked.Next add the runner beans and cook for a further six minutes, until the runners are cooked and have taken on the flavour of the sauce.Heat a tablespoon of oil in a small frying pan on a medium heat, add the mustard seeds, curry leaves, if using, and a good grind of black pepper, and cook until the curry leaves are crisp and the mustard seeds pop. Take off the heat and drain on kitchen paper.Back to the curry: once the beans are cooked, taste, add salt and lemon juice to taste (I usually go for a whole lemon but you may prefer less), then finish with the chopped green chilli and coriander. Serve with rice and rotis, salted yoghurt, pickles and chutneys.I serve these for lunch or dinner with feta, crusty bread and some salad. You can buy stringless runner beans otherwise peel them along the sides with a veg peeler ... or use a bean stringer.150ml extra-virgin olive oil1 medium onion, peeled and finely chopped1 garlic clove, peeled and finely chopped200g ripe tomatoes, roughly chopped400g runner beans, destringed and sliced at an angle into 2cm lengths2 tsp dried oreganoJuice of 1 unwaxed lemonHeat the oil in a deep, heavy-based pan over a medium heat, add the onion and cook for about five minutes, until softened but not browned. Add the garlic and cook for another minute or two, then add the tomatoes, green beans, oregano and a good pinch of salt. You are braising the beans, so you want them to be covered in the oil and tomato mixture if they are not, add a little water.Turn the heat down to low and cook the beans for 45 minutes to an hour. Check every now and then to make sure that the beans aren’t dry, adding more water if needed.The beans are done when they are soft and no longer squeaky, but not falling apart. Squeeze in the juice of half the lemon and grind in some black pepper. Taste, adding more salt, pepper and lemon as needed. Serve at room temperature."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f75f448106ea85c438f39e86cf1c6c507fa65caf/0_264_4176_2506/master/4176.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7076f6edd18b8a1f7b7f04e8812d974c","title":"cava a fizz to rival prosecco or champagne","story":"It’s got a bad rep as being inferior, but its recent upped quality makes it a great alternative to other sparkling winesIt’s easy to be cynical about the move to create a super-premium style of cava. For years, it has been losing market share to prosecco, and people perceive it as cheap, so the logical answer is to up the quality and charge more for it. But you could also argue that cava is underrated – that it has a unique style, grapes and terroir, and that the best vineyards can produce quite special wines now labelled paraje calificado.The odd thing is that, having launched to great fanfare at the end of last year, these are practically impossible to find in the UK, other than in a handful of pricey London restaurants (Hedonism stocks Alta Alella’s Mirgin Opus 2013 if you put in a special order, while Tanners will have Freixenet’s seriously impressive Can Sala in the autumn, but that will be almost a year after the denomination was announced). True, there isn’t very much of it, and maybe cava producers are focusing on more lucrative markets than the UK, but it’s also possible that this is a case of snobbery: retailers just don’t think there’s a market for high-quality Spanish sparkling wine.This is a shame, because cava has something quite distinctive to offer. As opposed to most fizz that’s made in cool parts of the world, such as England and Champagne, cava is made in the hot, dry Penedès wine region south-west of Barcelona, where grapes ripen early (the harvest should be well under way by the time you’re reading this). This typically means they don’t have to add a “dosage” (the sweet liquor that rounds out leaner, sharper base wines), which makes for drier wines that are more versatile with food. You don’t normally get that degree of richness in champagne unless you age the wine on its lees for several years. And the growing conditions make it easier for producers to go organic.Basic cava, too, is increasingly decent and, now that prosecco prices have inched up, favourably priced as well. The slightly coarse, yeasty flavour of less expensive cavas has been replaced by an attractive creaminess that contrasts favourably with many cheap proseccos, which can taste unpleasantly thin and metallic. Also, the best examples have an impressive ability to age (I recently tasted a 2012 vintage of Cordoníu’s Jaume that was quite spectacular – the best deal on that I could find is a three-bottle case at €81.60 with free shipping, or £72.73 at time of writing), so you do feel that cava gets a bit of a bum rap. Try it again if you haven’t for a while.Well priced, with an appealing whiff of ice-cream soda. A good party alternative to prosecco. An elegant cava typical of the region’s new ultra-brut style. Cool label, too ...Rich, opulent, creamy cava with a luscious touch of oak. Try it with scallops.Another serious vintage cava: better than many champagnes at the price."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9a7254e161bf306da538fd6f79950fde988abd2/0_38_2704_1623/master/2704.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=231e69d4892d631c42746beae451d780","title":"jose mourinho manchester united paul pogba happy","story":"• Manchester United manager says Pogba is ‘working well’ • ‘I cannot demand more from him, I cannot ask more from him’José Mourinho has claimed to be enjoying his strongest ever working relationship with Paul Pogba and the Manchester United manager praised the France midfielder for his application since returning from the World Cup – pointing in particular to last Friday’s display against Leicester City.Pogba continues to be an issue for Mourinho following the 25-year-old’s comments after that 2-1 win over the Foxes when he claimed he would be fined for “saying certain things”. Compounded by Barcelona’s rejected bid for him and Mourinho’s assertion that Pogba must treat each match for United with the same intensity as those he played for his country at Russia 2018 the pair have been reported to have a difficult relationship.Martial’s fine relates to the forward’s inactivity for over a week following the birth of his child in July. He is not expected to start against Brighton but Mourinho believes Pogba can turn in another impressive performance at Brighton, even if Valencia will resume the captaincy on his return from injury.“I am very confident but if he doesn’t that’s football,” said the 55-year-old. “If he doesn’t that’s football. If his objective is to play for the team, for the fans, if this is the objective – he has the right of a bad match, everybody has a bad day and has little ups and downs in the performance level.Mourinho also stated that Matteo Darmian is not expected to leave the club, with Italy’s transfer window closing on Friday.He said: “I don’t think he will go, and he cannot have any bad feeling towards us because we opened the door for him in case his desire was to go. But it looks like it’s not going to end in a transfer and for me is good news that Matteo is staying. He’s always an option for us, a reliable player, we know that his performance level is that one, we know he always does a job for the team. He’s loved in the group for his human nature, too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5b9e3106768e2af0a71e0b8de505da611bd1062/0_158_5233_3140/master/5233.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=179c84344e60705316a2474896cae906","title":"juventus cristiano ronaldo heralds uptick serie a mood","story":"This was supposed to be a grim summer for Italian football supporters. For the first time in six decades a World Cup was taking place without their national team. As the tournament in Russia got under way, the departing sports minister, Luca Lotti, portrayed the moment as calcio’s “Year Zero”.The fans themselves, though, did not seem so troubled by the prospect of a World Cup without the Azzurri. Mediaset recorded a cumulative TV audience of 297 million across the 64 games – 49 million more than the previous rights holders, Rai and Sky, had achieved between them in 2014.Two-thirds of Italian televisions were tuned into the final on 15 July. That distraction provided Cristiano Ronaldo with the perfect window in which to arrive unmolested at Turin’s Caselle airport and complete a €100m transfer from Real Madrid to Juventus.Year Zero? From the moment the Portuguese forward touched down in his private jet, this has started to feel more like YeaR7 for Serie A. Media coverage has portrayed Ronaldo not as a footballer but an alien, that aeroplane in fact a UFO bringing him to dazzle Italian audiences with his otherworldly talent. Such hyperbole was to be expected. Serie A had not witnessed a transfer coup of this magnitude since the arrival of the Brazilian Ronaldo at Internazionale from Barcelona in 2002.A five-time Ballon d’Or winner? No player from the Italian top flight has even been voted into the top three for that award in more than a decade. Ronaldo has already made a transformative impact off the pitch. Juve had the most social media interactions of any football club in the world in July. On YouTube alone they recorded 36.25 million views – almost double what they had totalled in the previous six months combined.For a club whose long-term ambitions rest on improving commercial revenue streams in line with those of the world’s very richest clubs – Juventus lagged some €270m behind Manchester United and Real Madrid in 2016-17 – this is already a significant development. But will his impact on the pitch be as significant?It is not hard to see how Ronaldo may help them to do so. The European Cup’s all-time leading goalscorer has hit double figures in that competition for seven seasons running. His goals also eliminated Juventus last term and he thwarted them in the 2017 final as well. But does his arrival threaten to widen the gap between Juventus and their domestic rivals? The Bianconeri have won the past seven Serie A titles, not to mention all four editions of the Coppa Italia since Allegri took charge. How is anyone supposed to get close?They may not but it is not a foregone conclusion that Juventus will pick up more points with Ronaldo. No matter how many goals he scores, there simply is not much room to improve on the 95 they piled up last season. Besides, will he even play every game or could he be rested to conserve energy for big European nights, as happened in recent seasons with Madrid?For those who hope to see Juventus’s domestic hegemony challenged, the real question ought to be whether any rivals are capable of producing similar consistency. Napoli got close last season, amassing a club-record 91 points, but a step back seems probable following the departure of Maurizio Sarri to Chelsea.To land Carlo Ancelotti as his replacement was impressive, yet even a man who has won domestic titles in Italy, England, Germany and France – not to mention three Champions Leagues – will have a hard time sustaining momentum. This team will need to learn a whole new way of playing, having also lost Jorginho as their midfield conductor.Instead it is Inter who have been billed as this season’s “anti-Juve” after compelling business in the transfer window. After taking time to instil an identity in his team last season Luciano Spalletti has now been reunited with Radja Nainggolan – a player who thrived under his charge at Roma. Stefan de Vrij and Sime Vrsaljko will bring experience to a defence which had already made great strides while Lautaro Martínez has thrilled at the other end in pre-season.A mooted deal to sign Luka Modric looks unlikely to come to fruition but the fact that Inter dared to dream of such a move – and the player’s apparent interest – feels indicative of change. Whether because of Ronaldo’s arrival or merely as an extension of the trend that brought him to Turin, there is a sense of bullishness among Italy’s leading clubs that has not always been present.Roma, fresh from a Champions League semi-final, missed out on Malcom but still added a wealth of intriguing young talent – from Ante Coric through to Justin Kluivert. Eusebio Di Francesco appears to be gearing his team up to play in a more attacking way, with Javier Pastore and Bryan Cristante hardly suggesting caution on either side of midfield in a 4-3-3.Even Milan, after a turbulent 12 months, look to be emerging stronger. Ronaldo’s arrival directly benefited the Rossoneri, paving the way for them to acquire Gonzalo Higuaín and Mattia Caldara from Juventus. Leonardo Bonucci went the other way but after a disappointing year at San Siro few were sad to see him go. Caldara and Alessio Romagnoli have the potential to mature into Italy’s starting centre-back partnership for years to come.Even more significant might be the returns of Leonardo and Paolo Maldini to the club in directors’ roles, after Elliott Management took control of the club. The pair’s combined experience can only be a benefit but there is a symbolic value too for a team who have seemed cut adrift from their more successful past.Lazio ought to challenge for a top-four spot once again, having thus far retained the core of the squad that missed out only on the final day last season. Keeping hold of Sergej Milinkovic-Savic would be a far more important piece of transfer business than anything else they could achieve.There is plenty more intrigue beyond the frontrunners. Can Parma, having successfully appealed against a five-point deduction for the problematic WhatsApp messages their forward Emanuele Calaiò sent to opponents late last season, stay afloat on their return to the top flight? What of Empoli, also newly promoted, who scored 88 goals in Serie B? Will a young Fiorentina team continue to thrive under Stefano Pioli? Might Torino push for Europe after quietly dropping close to €50m in this summer window, adding much-needed reinforcements in defence?Two games of the opening weekend have been postponed after the Genoa bridge tragedy but the season will still kick off on Saturday, when Juventus travel to Chievo. Serie A begins with Ronaldo, in other words. It could not have been any other way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0e0271d57ae9456dc90b056a259c91cc7e8ec94/0_301_5352_3211/master/5352.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=485c7a6439221cb639cf647d021d7a0e","title":"super cup reaction and celtics champions league exit football weekly extra","story":"Max Rushden and co on Atlético’s win over Madrid, European woe for Celtic and Bristol Rovers’ dubious half-time entertainmentRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Diego Laxalt in and Carlos Bacca out at Milan:No holding back. The former referees’ chief, Keith Hackett, has questioned his successor Mike Riley and pondered whether the Premier League may need to look abroad for official enforcements. Hackett was speaking in the wake of the departure of Bobby Madley and questioned Riley’s role. PGMOL is responsible for overseeing all Premier League matches, with Riley operating as its managing director. The body announced the departure of Madley on Thursday evening, despite the 32-year-old recently being promoted to the list of Fifa officials. Hackett said: “It’s on him (Riley). And I’ve got to ask why did (Mark) Clattenburg leave? Why did (Howard) Webb leave? Why did Mark Halsey leave? All early.” The PGMOL on Thursday said Madley had “decided to relocate due to a change in his personal circumstances”.Pep Guardiola is considering dropping Sergio Agüero ... he scored both of City’s goals in the 2-0 Community Shield victory over Chelsea at Wembley. This took the club record scorer to 201 strikes – yet after failing to register in last weekend’s 2-0 win at Arsenal Guardiola is minded to replace him with Gabriel Jesus.Brendan Rodgers hopped on the phone to woo Daniel Arzani to Celtic Park, the on-loan Manchester City midfielder has revealed. “I had a phone call from the gaffer Brendan Rodgers and he swayed my decision and convinced me to come here,” the 19-year-old Australia international said. “It wasn’t so much about the football, he was talking about the club, the tradition and the fan base. I got along with him, he is a really nice guy.”Done deal klaxon! England youth international Stephy Mavididi has left Arsenal to join Juventus, the Premier League club have announced. Mavididi, who did not make a single first-team appearance after coming through the ranks, will now look to make the grade with the Italian champions. The 20-year-old, who has previously spent time on loan at Charlton Athletic and Preston North End, will initially join Juve’s B team.Time for Torreira. Arsenal’s summer motto: Lucas Torreira does not obviously come from that lineage. One of the smallest players in the Premier League – he is the same size as the much-loved little marvel Santi Cazorla – he is more in the mould of intelligent screening midfielders Chelsea have specialised in, initially with Claude Makelele and currently with N’Golo Kanté. Torreira has a similar mix of instinctive knowhow to quickly get into the right places to intercept danger, with an accuracy of pass as the cherry on topMore from Guardiola, who insists the Amazon documentary on his Manchester City side will not reveal any of his secrets. “Tactics is football players not the ideas of a manager,” he says. “I think the people is going to see how a football team lives behind the scenes. Every game is completely different to another.”Done deal klaxon! There are a couple of new faces in the Championship Cuco Martina has joined Stoke City on loan from Everton and Jem Karacan, once of Reading, has joined Millwall, managed by former team-mate, Neil Harris, on a short-term deal. In Italy, Nigeria defender William Troost-Ekong has joined Udinese. Pep Guardiola has suggested Manchester City would be reluctant to swap venues for their two Premier League fixtures against Tottenham this season. There is uncertainty over where City’s scheduled away clash with Spurs on 28 October will take place because the club’s new stadium may not be open and Wembley is booked for an NFL game. “This can happen because they build an amazing stadium for Tottenham Hotspur, sometimes there are delays,” Guardiola said. “We are going to adapt if we can adapt but of course we are going to think of ourselves as well.”Some early Liverpool team news ... Jürgen Klopp could call Joël Matip and Fabinho into his lineup for Monday’s trip to Crystal Palace. Matip has not played for the club since March but is back in training after hip trouble and may feature on the bench, with Virgil van Dijk and Joe Gomez in place. Fabinho is also pressing for his debut after failing to make the season opener against West Ham. Dejan Lovren and Cagliari-bound Ragnar Klavan are out. How many of Newcastle’s five new signings will get the nod in south Wales? Salomón Rondón and Yoshinori Muto came off the bench in the defeat to Tottenham on the opening day, while fellow new recruits Fabian Schar, Ki Sung-yueng and Federico Fernández are all yet to feature. “When I say that I am happy with our players who came in, it is because some of them know the Premier League and can give us something from day one,” Rafael Benítez said. “The squad for me is stronger (than last season), we had some gaps we needed to fill - the team is better but we will see, we don’t have too many new faces in the starting XI. What we have is more experience, players who know the Premier League. Still we have some gaps that we know we will need to be lucky with injuries.”Feast your eyes on all things Chelsea v Arsenal:The Spanish club were unimpressed with Inter’s advances ...Gladly. Huddersfield Town are happy to frustrate Manchester City if it means they do not return from the Etihad Stadium empty-handed. “If it means we collect points by parking the bus, let’s do it,” says manager David Wagner. Watford are not getting carried away after an impressive opening-day win. Javi Gracia knows the task at hand, with Burnley next up on Sunday. “We know it’s only the beginning, to look forward we need to create something to not only look at the end of the road but improve day-by-day,” he says. “We need to keep this level to try to get more points in the future. I’m happy with the players we have in this moment.”Neil Warnock’s not sold on Newcastle United supporters giving owner Mike Ashley a hard time. “I think that’s a little bit of hot air, really. If you look at their investment in their players, I think they’ve improved the squad compared to last year. I think Mike Ashley’s an easy target, really. ‘Let’s all blame him’.”I’m going to hand over to Ben Fisher now. Have a fabulous weekend! You can email him here or tweet him here. Bye!It’s Roy Hodgson, speaking about Wilfried Zaha. Here’s some more from his press conference, where he was asked for a reaction to Zaha’s new contract:I think it’s very, very good that a player of his ability has committed his long-term future to the club. We think very highly of him both as a person and a player, and he’s got even a talismanic quality, being from this part of the world and starting his career at Crystal Palace. All of those things need to be factored in and we’re delighted that he’s decided now that this is where he wants to be. Because when you sign a contract of that length and magnitude, that’s where you intend to be for the coming years. Talking of Premier League managers gushing about their players, one of them has said this today:He’s very, very good all players have got qualities of course, and there aren’t many players who can literally do every single thing. But he scores top marks in so many aspects of the game, and when it comes to dribbling and manipulating the ball and going past opponents, I put him up there with the very best.Jamie Jackson has written about Jose Mourinho’s Pogba-based gushing:Mauricio Sarri has admitted Alvaro Morata is still suffering from a crisis of confidence, even if the Spain forward is likely to start tomorrow’s London derby against Arsenal. Morata, who was Chelsea’s record signing when he joined from Real Madrid for around £58m last summer, has scored only once in the top flight since Boxing Day. He began last weekend’s 3-0 victory at Huddersfield with Olivier Giroud not yet deemed match fit following his late return after the World Cup.Morata, prolific in his first few months at Stamford Bridge, had suffered back problems over the second half of last season, but is now fully fit and, apparently, simply in need of a goal to restore his form. “I’m not worried about Morata,” said Sarri. “He is a very great player. I think that, in this moment, he needs only to gain confidence. But he is a great player.Chelsea will be without the injured Cesc Fabregas against Arsenal, while Mateo Kovacic - signed on loan from Real Madrid - will only be able to feature from the bench. “He’s a very technical player but, in this moment, he has to work,” added Sarri. “I think he’s not ready now for 90 minutes, but maybe he could be used for the last 30 minutes. I expect a lot from him because, for me, he’s a very great player.” Tony Pulis appears to have taken Cuco Martina’s decision to join Stoke instead of his Middlesbrough side badly, and is now demanding players, and sharpish:We’ve started well but we still need to strengthen. We have got expectation of being the top of the table. To do that you can’t afford to lose the players we have lost and not replace them. Over 46 games in this league the depth and quality have to be there or otherwise I’m convinced we will fall away. That’s not just me shouting we need players in. The lads in the dressing room know we need players in. They’re not stupid.Internazionale’s pursuit of Luka Modric looks set to end not just in disappointment, but in potential punishment: the Press Association are reporting that Real Madrid have reported Inter to Fifa over their pursuit of the Croatian midfielder. A Fifa spokesperson confirmed that they had received a complaint from the Spanish club regarding the Serie A side’s attempt to sign the player. Given that the Italian transfer window closes this evening, it appears certain that Inter will not succeed in their mission to lure Modric away from the Bernabeu. An update now from Everton: New arrivals Kurt Zouma and Bernard could make their Everton debuts against Southampton tomorrow, manager Marco Silva has confirmed, but Yerry Mina is unavailable due to a slight foot injury. With Phil Jagielka starting a three-match suspension for his dismissal at Wolverhampton Wanderers last weekend the on-loan Chelsea defender is the more likely of the two to feature against Mark Hughes’ side at Goodison Park. It will be Zouma or Mason Holgate who partners Michael Keane in defence. Andre Gomes, another of the deadline day recruits, is currently sidelined with a hamstring injury picked up on Barcelona’s pre-season tour of the USA. Cuco Martina has joined Stoke City on a season-long loan - “We have three right-backs with Coleman and Kenny as well so we had to make a decision,” Silva explained – and Mohamed Besic and Yannick Bolasie are also expected to depart before the end of the month.A final chunk of Mourinho on Pogba. He’s asked if he is confident that Pogba will continue to play as well as he did against Leicester on the opening day:I am very confident, but if he doesn’t, that’s football. If his objective is to perform for the team and for the fans, he has the right to have a bad match. Everybody has a bad day. Everybody has little ups and downs in their performance level. Is he the captain? No, the captain is Antonio Valencia. He has the conditions to be a captain in the future. But with no Antonio in the team he was the captain, and for the next match he will be captain again, but one day when Antonio comes back, he will be captain.More from Mourinho on Pogba:Write what you want about him. Write what you want about me. Please don’t say lies. Please don’t put him in the situation where people can think that he’s not a polite, educated guy, which he is. He’s very polite. He’s very educated. He’s never had a fight with me, never had a hard change of words. Everything is respected. I have no problems at all.Jose Mourinho has been speaking about Paul Pogba: The truth is we are together for two years and a couple of weeks, and I’ve never been so happy with him as I am now. That’s the truth. I cannot demand more from him, I cannot ask more from him. He came here on Monday, he trained three days. I asked for his support, for his contribution in an important match for us when the team had difficulties. He did it better and for more time than we could expect. When he says he did it for the fans and for the team, it’s exactly what I want. Exactly what I demand from my players is what he is giving me. He is working well, he is playing well. I repeat, I couldn’t be happier than what I am. News of the former Crystal Palace defender Fan Zhiyi, who is in hot water in his native China:Milan say those deals “completed its incoming transfers for this summer transfer campaign”, so the rumours about a big-money loan deal for Sergej Milinkovic-Savic appear to be untrue. Meanwhile Carlos Bacca and Gianluca Lapadula have left Milan to join Villarreal and Genoa respectively, both on a permanent basis.Maurizio Sarri has dismissed talk of Eden Hazard moving to Madrid in this window. “I have spoken with him very often in the last 10 days,” Sarri said. “He has never said anything to me about this. I am sure Eden will be with us for this season.” Pep Guardiola has been speaking about Kevin de Bruyne:Whether he’s coming back in November or December, the team will be there. The team is not happy. We were not happy two seasons ago with Gundogan. We’re going to handle it, support him. My advice to him is to rest, to take the holidays he didn’t get in these two or three weeks, then he will come back to train inidually.Earlier today, Cuco Martina was being linked with a move to either Middlesbrough or Stoke. Looks like he’s made up his mind:Paolo Baldini has penned a preview of the Serie A season, which gets under way this weekend:This was supposed to be a grim summer for Italian football supporters. For the first time in six decades a World Cup was taking place without their national team present. As the tournament in Russia got under way, the outgoing sports minister, Luca Lotti, portrayed the moment as calcio’s “Year Zero”.The fans themselves, though, did not seem so troubled by the prospect of a World Cup without the Azzurri. Mediaset recorded a cumulative TV audience of 297 million across this summer’s 64 games – 49 million more than the previous rights holders, Rai and Sky, had achieved between them in 2014.Two-thirds of Italian televisions were tuned into the final on 15 July. That distraction provided Cristiano Ronaldo with the perfect window in which to arrive unmolested at Turin’s Caselle airport and complete a €100m transfer from Real Madrid to Juventus.Year Zero? From the moment the Portuguese forward touched down in his private jet, this has started to feel more like YeaR7 for Serie A.

But this isn’t one. It’s a crucial point about human happiness that might make us all more cheerful if we grasped it.To begin with the basics: most of us, most of the time, act as if it’s external circumstances that make us happy. That’s plainly true in the case of the deluded materialist who thinks earning millions will bring lasting joy. But it’s no less true of the discerning soul who seeks happiness in family, or nature, or improving the world: they’re all still external circumstances. Buddhism, a more radical creed than it’s often given credit for, rejects that, arguing that happiness comes not from what you’re experiencing, but from how deeply or mindfully you’re absorbed in that experience. It’s definitely easier to get absorbed in a “nice” experience like a sunset than, say, battling with a supermarket self-checkout machine. But ultimately it’s the quality of your experiencing that counts. That’s why, in the states of extreme concentration known as “jhanas”, Buddhist meditators can reach heights of rapture by focusing on something as boring as the breath.Having misunderstood the source of positive emotions, we naturally then bungle how we respond to them: we try to get more of the external thing we believe is causing our happiness, or fear we’re going to lose it – both of which are recipes for misery. As the meditation teacher Allen Weiss wrote in the Buddhist magazine Lion’s Roar: “What we don’t do, but should do, is to put our attention directly on the subjective feeling of the emotion that has arisen.” Focus on the feeling, not the sunset. It’s a curious truth that when you gently pay attention to negative emotions, they tend to dissipate – but positive ones expand.And just to be clear: this isn’t positive thinking, which entails convincing yourself your external circumstances are, or soon will be, better than they are, or “deciding” you’re going to feel happy. Instead, it means paying attention to positive emotions that already exist. And in virtually any life, however beleaguered, they do exist. Maybe it’s the tiny whisper of pleasure at stepping into the shower, sipping a cup of tea, or feeling the breeze on your skin. See if you can focus on the emotion – the pleasure, not the shower or the tea – for at least 20 seconds, Weiss advises. You should find it grows.I anticipate the usual objection: if everyone grew permanently blissed-out about showers and tea, would nothing get done? Would people stop fighting injustice? The answer, to paraphrase the author Robert Wright, is: maybe! But look around. We’re a long way from needing to worry about that yet.You can hear hundreds of talks on meditation by Ayya Khema and other teachers – from the easy-to-grasp to the ultra-technical – at the Dharmaseed.org website and app."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83cd75d9aeda1b04e731d53ee53f56e53705ba7b/0_768_1997_1198/master/1997.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63b37914ffd6b1ea0f6dea56a174ec81","title":"well done ticketmaster for closing resale sites but it aint over yet","story":"GetMeIn and Seatwave are on their way out but Viagogo and StubHub will snap up toutsTicketmaster’s decision to shut down its ticket resale sites – GetMeIn and Seatwave – has been greeted with widespread approval.This, the company says, will help reduce the number of touts charging huge mark-ups for tickets they have harvested in bulk, including from Ticketmaster’s own systems.However, there is reason to be sceptical – both about Ticketmaster’s apparent altruism and the impact that closing secondary ticketing sites will have on the cost of live music.For a start, GetMeIn and Seatwave will be no great loss to Ticketmaster. According to the latest accounts filed with Companies House, GetMeIn made a post-tax profit of only £1.4m in 2016, while Seatwave lost £3m.The chief cause of such lacklustre financial performance is the parallel success of controversial rivals StubHub and Viagogo, which will snap up any touts who were still using Ticketmaster’s secondary outlets.There is also a question hanging over the scale of Ticketmaster’s commitment to reasonable prices.Its premium Platinum service uses “dynamic pricing”, adjusting prices according to demand, much like airline seats or Uber rides, but in a far less competitive market.A leading market share in ticketing – coupled with parent company Live Nation’s global sway as a promoter and venue operator – gives Ticketmaster significant pricing power.In the case of Platinum, the company reserves some of the best seats in the house and, when the event “sells out”, drip-feeds them into the market at inflated prices.Paul McCartney’s upcoming UK tour appeared to have sold out within minutes. Seats at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow, which had been on sale at £65, were later released via Platinum for more than £500.Ticketmaster says Platinum “takes touts out of the equation” because it makes top-quality seats available for a premium, but still for less than touts were charging.However, research by the  found that in many cases, secondary sites are offering nearly identical tickets to those available via Platinum but for less money.The company refuses to say whether Platinum customers have exclusive access to the best seats, or could end up sitting next to somebody who paid the normal price.The Labour MP Sharon Hodgson said Ticketmaster had “serious questions to answer about their business model”.She said: “To find Ticketmaster blatantly overpricing tickets that they deliberately hold back in order to do so shows just how broken this whole market is.”To be fair to Ticketmaster, the use of Platinum requires consent from the artist, who pockets the difference and must weigh up the risk of alienating their fans.Stuart Galbraith, the founder of Ed Sheeran’s promoter Kilimanjaro Live, said: “I’m not a fan of Platinum because I don’t think there’s any added value for the customer but it’s down to the inidual artist’s choice.”He said fans of artists who have experimented with dynamic pricing have seen the price of some tickets increase substantially. “For Taylor Swift and Jay-Z or Beyonce, you got prices that were £350 or £380.“For some artists, and Ed is an example, it was one price throughout at £75 or £80.”The choice may be in the hands of artists but Ticketmaster executives have been quick to blame artists who try to keep prices low for encouraging touting.Yet the company is a leading voice in an industry that has been too slow to develop technological solutions such as the digital ticketing systems offered by firms such as Dice, which offer ways to combat touting without capitulating to upward price pressure.Even if Ticketmaster’s withdrawal from secondary ticketing has no immediate positive effect on fans, it may at least sharpen the minds of lawmakers, regulators and businesses that still work with Viagogo and StubHub.Adam Webb, a spokesman for the music industry campaign group FanFair Alliance, said: “While it’s true that large-scale touts will continue to use StubHub and Viagogo, those two sites are currently under significant pressures. “In October this year, StubHub lost their partnerships at the O2 and the Wembley Arena. That’s a massive blow to their credibility. “Also, by January 2019 they must become fully compliant with UK consumer law and disclose details of any iniduals listing more than 100 tickets per year.  “Viagogo is under even heavier fire. It’s a toxic brand and facing enforcement actions worldwide, including from the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority and National Trading Standards. Those actions cannot come soon enough. “There will also be increasing demands on Google to stop taking their advertising. If that happened it would arguably be the most significant change of all. “Without their misleading dominance of paid search, Viagogo would likely be dead in the water.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/089c7260109ceb1b59a57f2458754ef6dfe00327/0_364_2765_1659/master/2765.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a9d425629d65979f0ab8bdf1a2c44b3","title":"the queen of soul aretha franklin a life in pictures","story":"The queen of soul for six decades, Aretha Franklin, has died aged 76.

Rinkēvičs said it was a “very considerable risk” but stressed he remained optimistic an agreement with Britain could be reached.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Jensen was asked about Rinkēvičs’s remarks. He said: “I also believe that 50-50 is a very good assessment because time is running out and we need to move really fast if we’ve got to strike a deal that is positive both for the UK and EU.”He said that everyone who wanted there to be a good deal “needs to put in some effort in the months to come, otherwise I’m afraid that time will run out”. He went on to describe Theresa May’s Chequers plan – which includes a pledge that the UK would apply domestic tariffs on goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs on goods heading into the EU – as a “realistic proposal for good negotiations”.“We need to go into a lot of details but I think it’s a very positive step forward and a necessary step,” he said.The discussion comes after the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, warned that a no-deal Brexit would be “a mistake that we would regret for generations”. Eurosceptics in his party accused him of weakening May’s hand by making such comments.Ministers have spent weeks emphasising that May is “not kidding” when she says she will walk away rather than accept a bad deal, but Hunt sent the opposite message, suggesting that Britain would make concessions.Jensen refused to say whether Hunt would be easier to work with than his predecessor, Boris Johnson, but said: “I do believe that we had a good cooperation with Boris and I’m sure that we will have good cooperation with Jeremy.”In an interview with ITV News, Hunt said the UK would find a way to “prosper and thrive” but a no-deal Brexit would be a “geo-strategic mistake”.He said: “We want a deal with the EU that means we really can have a deep and special partnership, a friendship, going forward, not just in terms of our economic relations but in terms of everything else that happens on the world stage, and it would be a mistake that we would regret for generations if we were to have a messy, ugly orce and that is what we all want to avoid.”Hunt’s comments drew criticism from Brexiter MPs. Conor Burns, a Tory MP, told the : “The thing that we want to avoid for ‘generations to come’ is being locked into a permanent orbit around the EU where we end up with a deal but don’t have a seat around the table.”The foreign secretary said later on Twitter his warning was intended for the EU, saying it would be “a big mistake for Europe because of inevitable impact on long term partnership with UK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbb996adcf3f9fabb5d118cbe6a679767a26baa4/848_171_2652_1591/master/2652.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d490860a643233aca8b8465fe53ea32d","title":"jeremy corbyn foreign causes a blessing or a curse","story":"The Labour leader’s campaigns have provided inspiration for supporters and ammunition for his detractors. Ewen MacAskill takes a close look at the recordAndrew Murray, Jeremy Corbyn’s longtime friend and adviser, ticks off a list of foreign causes that the Labour leader has pursued over almost half a century: Chile, South Africa, Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, among others.For Murray, it is an honourable record, and one that has been distorted or lost amid the abuse and vilification Corbyn has faced since he stood for the Labour leadership in 2015.The Labour leader has been accused of racism and antisemitism of being too close to the men of violence. During last year’s general election campaign, the Daily Mail, under the headline “Apologists for terror”, said Corbyn “personally has spent a political lifetime courting mass murderers in the Middle East, Ireland and elsewhere in the world”.Returning to the theme this week, newspaper articles have implied – in a story subsequently debunked – that Corbyn had paid homage in 2014 to Black September, the Palestinian group responsible for the 1972 massacre of Israeli athletes.Since Corbyn became leader, there have been tensions within his office as well as within the parliamentary Labour party about whether his record on foreign affairs is a negative or a plus.One school of thought is that he should just shut up about it to avoid attracting the kind of controversy he has faced over the last few weeks, and that, anyway, general elections are won or lost on domestic, not foreign, policy. The alternative view is that Corbyn has a good story to tell and his foreign policy positions are more popular than the political classes believe.Corbyn has ended up somewhere in the middle, not hiding his record but not shouting about it either, making only a handful of speeches devoted specifically to foreign policy. He delivered one apologising for Labour’s role in the Iraq war, he did another in London during last year’s general election campaign, another in response to the Manchester bombing and one in Geneva in December last year.He is planning another in the next few months.For many rightwing commentators, the left lost the ideological battle when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. The left, however, counters with a list of foreign policy issues on which it has been proved right, going back to the Vietnam war, and Corbyn’s supporters see him as the personification of this.For them, he has been a consistent opponent of misguided western military intervention, a supporter of countries and people fighting for self-determination, an advocate of peace through dialogue, totally opposed to violence, and not in thrall to armed struggle.David Clark, who was a special adviser on foreign affairs to the late Robin Cook, arguably the most leftwing foreign secretary the UK has had, agrees Corbyn has been proved right on many issues. But this is heavily qualified, with Clark dismissing Corbyn’s “simplistic anti-imperialist stance” and what he sees as a reflex response of opposing every western military intervention.“If you oppose every intervention, you are going to be right from time to time,” Clark said. “Much like a clock that is stuck telling the right time twice a day, Corbyn has been right on some of the issues.”Murray does not see it like that. “Jeremy has called every major policy issue in the last 40 years – from apartheid to Iraq and Libya – right, when the establishment has been mostly or unitedly wrong,” Murray said.Corbyn’s interest in foreign affairs can be traced back to a trip that straddled 1969 and 1970, taking in Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Chile.These were heady days on a continent full of drama: military coups, liberation theology and the US secretly conspiring with the right to undermine leftwing governments and movements. In 1969, Corbyn took part in a student demonstration in São Paulo against Brazil’s military dictatorship.It was Chile, however, that had the greatest impact. He was in the country in 1970 when Salvador Allende, who was on the left, became president. He was overthrown three years later in a brutal military coup led by General Augusto Pinochet. Corbyn had found a cause.By contrast, Margaret Thatcher, on becoming prime minister in 1979, restored diplomatic relations with Pinochet’s Chile, which had been broken off by the previous Labour government. When Pinochet was arrested in the UK in 1998 in response to an extradition request over human rights violations, Thatcher treated him like an honoured guest, visiting him at his temporary home in Surrey.In his Geneva speech, Corbyn praised Allende and derided Pinochet for turning Chile “into a laboratory for free market fundamentalism”.Corbyn’s interest in Latin America has never waned. During internal policy discussions, he has often blindsided others by unexpectedly raising issues such as the recent election of the leftwing populist Andrés Manuel López Obrador as Mexican president.While there is a general consensus that Corbyn has been right about Chile, views are polarised over his unwavering support for the late Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, a persistent opponent of the US, and his reluctance to criticise his successor Nicolás Maduro.Corbyn was an early opponent of apartheid, serving on the national executive of the Anti-Apartheid Movement. One of the best-known pictures of him shows him being arrested in 1984 for protesting outside South Africa House in London.He was later exonerated and awarded compensation, which he donated to the Anti-Apartheid Movement and to Nelson Mandela’s African National Congress.While the late Mandela is now generally venerated, that was not the case in the 1970s and 80s, with Thatcher describing the ANC as a “typical terrorist organisation”.Corbyn recalled this in a tweet earlier this year opposing Theresa May’s invitation for Donald Trump to visit the UK. “Margaret Thatcher was on the wrong side of history when she supported apartheid,” he wrote.Thatcher’s position has undergone attempts at revision. Robin Renwick, the British ambassador to South Africa from 1987-91, said Thatcher had opposed apartheid and, behind the scenes, had pressed the South African government to release Mandela.One of the keys to understanding Corbyn is the Stop the War coalition, founded less than two weeks after the 911 attack. Labour MPs who joined included Tony Benn, George Galloway and Corbyn, who went on to chair it for four years. Murray was also a member.Stop the War helped organise the London march on the eve of the 2003 Iraq war, one of the biggest protests in British history, and opposed intervention in Afghanistan, Libya and Syria. Corbyn spoke at an estimated 1,000 events around the country, a dress rehearsal for his Labour leadership campaign.Setting out his opposition to the US-led invasion of Afghanistan, Corbyn put the blame for the rise of the Taliban on America: “The Taliban were formed with US weapons. Al-Qaida was founded by US trainers. What goes around comes around.”His interest in Iraq predated the invasion. In the 1980s, when the US and UK governments were backing Saddam Hussein in the war against Iran, supplying him with arms, Corbyn was opposed. As an MP, he was among the first to condemn Saddam’s chemical attack on Iraqi Kurds at Halabja in 1988.He opposed UK military involvement in Kosovo in 1999, Libya in 2011 and Syria in 2015, and described UK participation in airstrikes in Syria this year as legally questionable.Clark says not all military interventions are necessarily wrong, citing the Nato airstrike on Serbia to protect Albanian Kosovans and the subsequent invasion of Kosovo, which Corbyn opposed.Clark also argues that the Libyan intervention was well-intentioned, to stop a massacre, and the failure was in the subsequent lack of nation-building.Corbyn denies he is a pacifist and has said he does not rule out supporting UN military intervention, though the only example he will cite is UN intervention in East Timor in 1999.Corbyn’s support for the Palestinians has caused him more problems than any other foreign policy issue. A long-time member of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, he has been accused of being too close to Hamas, the elected government in Gaza, and to Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the anti-Israeli paramilitary organisation based in Lebanon.His involvement in the Palestinian cause is at the root of accusations against him of antisemitism, which have dominated Labour politics for the last two months. According to one of those close to him, Corbyn has been more upset by this than all the previous vilification campaigns he has faced, believing it is it much more intense and personal.Some of those around him will say privately they feel he has been the victim of a smear campaign. But even some of these find him culpable for allowing the row to drag on, citing the rewriting of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition.Newspapers this week carried stories about Corbyn’s presence at a Palestinian cemetery in Tunis in 2014.One story read: “A memorial wreath in hand, Jeremy Corbyn stands feet from the graves of terror leaders linked to the Munich Massacre … Buried in the cemetery in Tunisia are members of Black September, the terror group which massacred 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics.”A number of problems emerged with the story, not least that none of the members of Black September who carried out the massacre are buried in Tunis. Another is that the wreath-laying ceremony was to commemorate members of the Palestine Liberation Organisation who were killed in a 1985 Israeli air raid on Tunis, a raid condemned by Thatcher at the time.There have been other such stories linking Corbyn to armed groups in the Middle East and elsewhere, including Ireland.The writer Ronan Bennett, who worked as a research assistant for Corbyn at Westminster in the 1980s, said he had never heard Corbyn support the idea of armed struggle.“As a leader, Jeremy is not without flaws, and his ideas may not always be fully worked out, but he is principled. He said to me the whole point of engagement is to persuade people to put away the guns,” he said.Bennett, whose presence at Westminster caused a stir at the time, with him having been a prisoner at Long Kesh in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, said: “He really has only one speech, one theme: that we should all get together and be nice to one another. Jeremy is a kind of vegan, pacifist idealist, one with a clear understanding of politics and history, and a commitment to the underdog.”One of the charges against Corbyn is that he is hypocritical in presenting himself as an independent arbiter while in fact being an activist. That he is pro-Palestinian rather than neutral. His supporters see no contradiction, arguing it is possible to take a side and still promote dialogue.Corbyn came under attack from both Conservative and Labour MPs in March after refusing to blame Russia for the Salisbury nerve agent attack.He might have got away with such an expression of scepticism a week later. Instead, it created another row, another distraction, including accusations he is soft on Russia.Corbyn has never been one of those on the left who was close to the Soviet Union.George Galloway, a friend of Corbyn for 40 years who was also a parliamentary colleague and campaigned alongside him at Stop the War, said: “He was never, unlike myself, pro-Soviet. He is not an orthodox Trotskyist communist. He is more woolly Californian. He has more in common with Michael Foot than Karl Marx. He is a pacifist who will speak to anyone.”While not an adherent to the Soviet Union, Corbyn is opposed to Nato, which puts him out of line with party policy. He described the US-led coalition as “a danger to world peace”.He reflects a view common on the left that, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the US and Nato had a chance to embrace Russia but instead expanded eastwards, taking in former members of the Soviet bloc.Clark, who has established a reputation as a Russia specialist, sees Corbyn’s instinctive hostility towards US dominance as problematic. “His simplistic anti-imperialist position leads him to be insufficiently critical of regimes such as Russia. People around him see Putin as a counter-balance to western imperialism.”Clark said the problem with such an approach was that Putin’s transgressions tended to be overlooked. “The Ukraine crisis is a point in question. Corbyn’s reaction was to blame the aggression on Nato rather than the aggressor. That is the conclusion you come to if you share Corbyn’s anti-western world view.”It is debatable whether Ireland should be on a foreign list, given Northern Ireland is part of the UK. But Corbyn has been a longtime supporter of a united Ireland.He courted controversy in October 1984 when he invited two former republican prisoners – Linda Quigley and Gerry MacLochlainn, the latter jailed on explosive charges – to the Commons just two weeks after the bombing of the Tory conference in Brighton.In May last year, Northern Ireland again dogged Corbyn. In what can be seen as a prelude to the Tunis cemetery controversy, the Labour leader was asked during a televised election debate about attending a meeting of the republican Wolfe Tone Society in 1987 at which there was a minute’s silence for eight IRA members killed by the SAS.He said: “The contribution I made to that meeting was to call for peace and dialogue.”Danny Morrison, Sinn Féin’s former head of communications and a former member of the Northern Ireland assembly, recalls Corbyn visiting them in west Belfast in 1984.“At no time did he express support or solidarity for the armed struggle,” Morrison said. “The point is, Jeremy Corbyn never ever supported physical force in Ireland. You can have this position and still sympathise with those who died like Bobby Sands. It is scandalous and ridiculous to suggest there is a link between Corbyn and the IRA.”Such meetings were controversial but Corbyn can claim vindication by revelations the British government was engaged in secret meetings in the same period, a dialogue which eventually brought about the 1998 Belfast peace agreement.Corbyn’s campaign team expected from the day he first put himself forward to be leader that his foreign policy record would be picked over by opponents.One of those close to him, reflecting on the last few weeks, acknowledged it had been tough, but said: “He has been through it before. And he will face it again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/924190e416055ab8fedf660afd674cb395aaf99b/0_0_5370_3223/master/5370.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b533cfa7244bdc1645b248bccd5c0fc1","title":"period poverty north ayrshire council scottish labour free sanitary products","story":"North Ayrshire sets up scheme in toilets of public buildings to help tackle period povertyA Scottish council will provide free sanitary products in all public buildings in a scheme aimed at breaking the taboo about period poverty.North Ayrshire council believes it is the first local authority in the UK to introduce the policy, which will come into effect in up to 100 libraries, community centres and other public offices from Friday.Joe Cullinane, the Scottish Labour leader of the council, said the move followed the success of a scheme that had been providing free sanitary products to all secondary schools in the area since last August.“When you’ve got that kind of momentum in schools, you think that periods don’t stop at the school gates, so what about their sister or mother?” Cullinane said. “How can we normalise this even further, so that it’s like providing toilet paper or handwash?”Cullinane estimates the initiative will cost £40,000, a large part of which will initially be spent on vending machines for women’s toilets.Research published by the Women for Independence (WFI) group last spring revealed that nearly one in five women in Scotland had experienced period poverty – the struggle to pay for basic sanitary products on a monthly basis – which has a significant impact on hygiene, health and wellbeing.Cullinane said: “It’s about dignity and respect, at the end of the day. It’s not just about the cost, but about normalising the whole subject, and that’s where the debate should be going nationally.”He stressed the importance of making the scheme universal. “Any scheme that relies on women asking for help still has a barrier,” he said. “Now a woman can be going into a library for any number of reasons, and then go to the toilet and use the vending machine discreetly without there being any taboo.”Scotland is leading the way in offering greater access to free period products. The government will provide free products in all schools, colleges and universities from this autumn, while the Scottish Labour MSP Monica Lennon has introduced a member’s bill at Holyrood to launch a universal scheme. Many businesses and organisations – including Celtic football club – have also started providing free products.Lennon described the North Ayrshire scheme as “a breakthrough for gender equality”. She said: “The ambition behind my member’s bill is for Scotland to lead the world on menstrual health and this is about changing our culture as well as the law, so I’m delighted that North Ayrshire council is leading by example and helping to change attitudes towards menstruation and access to period products.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6499e11a3b16ff598e28b49e9379b2a3c0f4b4ac/369_761_4485_2691/master/4485.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4df819e58dc588948f442cecc396bf7","title":"simone biles gymnastics olympics interview","story":"Much has changed since Biles’ history-making coronation at Rio 2016, but one truth remains: her only competition is herselfThe smile that lit up the 2016 Olympics in Rio, where she affirmed her presumptive status as the greatest gymnast ever with four gold medals in seven days, was nowhere to be found during last month’s US Classic in Columbus, which marked Biles’ first meet after nearly two years away from competition.She’d stepped out of bounds on her floor exercise. She’d taken a hop back on her vault. She took a rare fall off the uneven bars that left her in an unfamiliar position entering the final rotation: second place.Then Biles, needing at least a 14.0 on the balance beam to avoid her first defeat since 2013, took a deep breath and nailed her routine, making a mockery of the discipline’s inherent unpredictability and that 711-day layoff. Her composite tally of 58.700 was not only enough to win, but marked the highest all-around score in the world since the 62.366 she’d posted in Rio.Much has happened in the two years since Biles took a break from gymnastics. The sport she’s come to define was rocked by the worst sexual abuse scandal in American sports history. Donald Trump was elected president and has since adopted sports as a proxy battle in the culture wars, ushering in an era of athlete activism unprecedented since the 1960s. But the 21-year-old from suburban Houston, who will make the second step of her comeback at this weekend’s US gymnastics championships in Boston, was able to show that one constant remains intact: her only competition is herself. First, the obvious question, given Biles’ body of work and legacy are beyond assail: why even come back?Sure, there’s a chance to make even more history at Tokyo 2020, where she can become the oldest woman in more than five decades to win the Olympic all-around title, the sport’s most coveted prize, and the first repeat champion since Vera Caslavska did it for the former Czechoslovakia in 1968. But Biles, who was born three months short of the age cutoff for the London Games, had already been hailed as the best gymnast in history before she’d even competed in an Olympics.“It just didn’t feel like real life while we were doing it,” she told the  this week. “You think it’s some different world, which it was. I almost think you forget how much work you have to put into it until you’re there.”Biles returned home after the Olympics to the whirlwind, peripatetic existence of a mainstream celebrity, slingshotting around the US for red-carpet walks, promotional appearances and glossy photo shoots when not headlining the 36-city Kellogg’s Tour of Gymnastics Champions or competing on ABC’s Dancing With the Stars. Then came a hard-earned series of vacations with the family and friends she’d sacrificed so much time with during her monastic preparations for Rio.But even after 14 months away from the gym, Biles knew she’d be back, if only, as she puts it, because she didn’t want to look back decades from now and wonder: what if?“I always knew I was probably going to come back,” she said. “It was just a matter of when. And so we kind of just settled down and waited for everything to slow down, and that’s when we decided in October of last year. By December, I had stopped traveling completely and was in the gym full time.”Following an amicable split with longtime personal coach Aimee Boorman, Biles enlisted the husband-and-wife coaching team of Laurent Landi and Cecile Canqueteau-Landi and training partner Ashton Locklear, who was an alternate for the Rio Games. At the World Champions Centre, the sprawling 56,000 sq ft gym built by her parents as their retirement venture, a constant stream of music – Eastside by benny blanco, Halsey \u0026amp Khalid is a current staple – helps Biles power through her famed marathon training sessions.But stepping back into her grueling regimen – six hours a day, six days a week – after so much time away was anything but easy. “We started with a lot of basics and conditioning in the beginning, so that you get back in competitive shape,” Biles said. “Usually for gymnasts the hardest part about returning is losing the weight you gain while you’re off, but I didn’t gain really anything on my time off so I really didn’t have that to worry about. I was just sore a lot. You just have to push through that.”She added: “It’s hard mentally and physically. I remember some of the days I’m like: ‘Why am I here? What am I doing? What did I do?’ But in the end it’s all worth it, so I’m happy with my decision to return.”The scary part for her rivals, as suggested by her US Classic showing, is that Biles may be better than ever. She won by a whopping 1.2 points despite major deductions on three disciplines, underscoring the caliber of difficulty and execution in her routines that few can even approach.The vaults that she performed in Rio are both unchanged. It’s the same for the beam, besides the addition of a front pike instead of a front tuck. But she’s added to her already jaw-dropping floor routine, adding a double-double lay-out to her first pass and a front-full to full-in on her second before punctuating it with the familiar double-double tuck and her signature: the Biles. The biggest improvements have come on the uneven bars, her weakest discipline, where she’s added a shaposh half and a double-double to her dismount under the watch of Laurent, who helped guide Madison Kocian to a silver medal on the apparatus in Rio. Biles has done some growing up since the Olympics, moving from her parents’ house into her own apartment, going public with her boyfriend (former gymnast Stacey Ervin), turning 21 and adding a French bulldog puppy named Lilo into the fold – even if he’s a bit too naughty to travel for now. She remains bemused by the trappings of stardom: “I got my Olympic ring tattoo and it’s on my right hand and everyone tried to tell me it was on my left hand, and I’m like, ‘OK, you guys have my arms on your body, I know that for sure!’”Other changes are less welcome. The specter of politics loomed over this year’s Winter Olympics far more than what Biles and her fellow Team USA members dealt with in Brazil, a snake-pit which she is more than content to avoid completely. Then of course there is the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal, which has prompted seismic changes in the sport. Biles acknowledged in January that she was abused under the guise of medical treatment by the disgraced former USA Gymnastics team doctor, who is serving an effective life sentence for his crimes. But she finds it extremely difficult to discuss what has happened, particularly while trying to balance her healing with the intense demands of the gym, and does not want to talk about the case in our interview.She enters this weekend’s nationals as a big favorite to become the first woman to capture five US all-around titles. At stake are the five places on the United States team that will travel to the world championships in Qatar this fall, which will be finalized at an October selection camp. “This week will be my second competition back, so I’m trying to take it day by day, competition by competition, and see how that goes,” Biles said. “The ultimate goal in the end will be worlds for this year and then in a couple of years the Olympics.”The older, wiser Biles says she feels less pressure now than ever before, measuring success less by victories and defeats. That must be easy when you never lose, but the point stands.“Everybody thinks a champion has to always be the winner, come out on top,” she said. “But I think everybody inside is a champion themselves depending on how you handle your failures and your successes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b5d669b6a3e35537f23d300145382a60676b22d/694_244_3183_1910/master/3183.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=581b0d0a4d699dd04648ad0325065280","title":"smriti mandhana india western storm womens super league interview","story":"Four years ago Smriti Mandhana was a bespectacled 18-year-old embarking on her first tour of England. Nobody knew her name. Now, having become the first Indian to play in the Kia Super League, she is the story of the tournament.Her figures are remarkable. She is already the leading runscorer in any edition of the KSL, with more than 400 runs for Western Storm – the team who represent the south-west of England – at a strike rate of 176 she has also hit the fastest half-century and the most sixes in KSL history, plus this season’s only century.Last week Western Storm live-streamed one of their matches for the first time 26,000 people tuned in to watch her bat. And on Saturday evening they face Surrey Stars at the Oval in a game live on Sky Sports Cricket, where even more viewers are expected.The biggest change in those four years? “Age,” she laughs. “Mentally I’m still the same person. But I’ve learned a lot of things, too.”It has been a bumpy ride for the 22-year-old, who grew up in Maharashtra in India, playing cricket with her father and brother. Catapulted into the India side at 16, having first gone along to local trials for fun aged nine, the past four years have brought their share of failure as well as success. Perhaps the biggest was last year’s World Cup final at Lord’s. India, surprise finalists, came agonisingly close to lifting the trophy before a wonder spell from England’s Anya Shrubsole intervened and they fell 10 runs short of winning.An experience like that might be expected to leave scars but Mandhana says not. “I only thought about it for half an hour! We had three months off afterwards and I tried to work on making small technical changes. But I’ve definitely left it behind me now.”For Mandhana, the career-defining moment had in fact come at the beginning of 2017, when she spent five months out of action with a knee injury sustained playing for Brisbane Heat in the Women’s Big Bash League in Australia. She says the injury transformed her mindset. “I wasn’t able to walk. I spent two months on crutches. I used to feel like not scoring runs is the worst thing in life but I started thinking: ‘No, at least I’m getting to go out on the field wearing the Indian jersey.’ Not many get to do that. I am lucky. Now, if I get runs or don’t get runs, I’m just going out there trying to enjoy my cricket.”The mentality of batting with freedom was one that instantly translated into results. At last year’s World Cup she hit 90 in India’s group-stage win over England and followed it up with a century against West Indies. She is enjoying a prolific run of form in 2018, including averaging 90 in India’s home ODI series against England, which her side won 2-1. She was recently ranked the world’s No\u0026nbsp4 ODI batter.Fame and fortune do not appear to have affected her unduly. She says she spends her free time watching Marvel films and sleeping. “I love sleeping, I can sleep for 15 hours a day,” she adds. Her family have played their part in keeping her feet on the ground. “If I score 100 or zero, my mum will still ask me: ‘Did you eat?’ She will never ask me: ‘How did you get out?’” Her father, meanwhile, remains one of her harshest critics. “I hit a century in Super League and he says: ‘Come on, you have to score 200 now,’” she laughs.Mandhana is living proof that the concept of the Super League – to bring the world’s best players into the same competition to learn from each other – is alive and well. One revelation has been getting to know Shrubsole, India’s nemesis last year. “I always felt she was a very angry kind of a person, very grumpy. But now, being her teammate, I’ve got to know her and we have had some good conversations.”More than anything, though, Mandhana’s spectacular performances with the bat have played no small part in ensuring success for Western Storm – who are looking good to defend their title – and for the Super League as a whole."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f20e7fc667382d6f7a38d0b1518899385e025df/0_167_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11698ceca356c2deda2702cfdee6bd1f","title":"trojan horse review islamic schools plot powerfully revisited","story":"Summerhall, EdinburghA sobering examination of British children caught in media crossfireIn the spring of 2014, what was the Trojan horse? Was it the Islamist doctrine allegedly smuggled into 21 Birmingham schools by a shadowy group of teachers and governors? Was it the vulnerability in the government’s flagship academy programme that allowed corrupt ideology to slip in unnoticed and set to work poisoning our children? Or could the Trojan horse have been the government’s ideology – a isive blend of free-market dogma and zealotry that found indoctrination where there were only exemplary grades and restrictions where there were only liberal values?This last version of events is the proposition of Lung’s straight-talking, clear-headed and elegantly presented piece of documentary theatre that revisits the much reported – and much inflated – news story. It exposes the factors that turned what should have been a quick dismissal of a vexatious complaint into the subject of national outrage. Drawing on 200 hours of interviews, as well as material in the public domain, the play’s writers, Helen Monks and Matt Woodhead, make the case that a government fearful that terrorism was being nurtured on its watch, egged on by a rightwing press too ready to believe it, encouraged the over-hasty acceptance of an anonymous document alleging an Islamist conspiracy to game the system.Set in Park View school (now Rockwell academy), Woodhead’s production gives voice to teachers, pupils, councillors and complainants, showing how even a baseless allegation can slither its way into the smooth running of an organisation, stirring up conflict and stoking ision. Rearranging their desks in choreographed lines, powerfully lit by Will Monks, the five highly focused young actors look us in the eye as if to emphasise the truth of what they are saying. They do not deny the skeletons in the cupboard (offensive WhatsApp comments by teachers, a perceived insensitivity to the needs of gay pupils), but neither do they accept the level of scrutiny was anything other than politically motivated. Their anger is all the more affecting because of its restraint. They let plain statistics show how the affair led to plummeting attainment records, leaving the lives of children as collateral damage. It is a sober, forceful condemnation of injustice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9dcc2340fa7c80afe70ca4b9f4be94586832cd9/0_7_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fac15a72b3374b63592ad75f74a3ac6","title":"elon musk says past year has been excruciating and worst is yet to come","story":"Musk says he has endured ‘the most difficult and painful’ time but insists ‘I was not on weed’ during last week’s Twitter furoreElon Musk has said the past year of his professional life has been “excruciating” and that stress over his business had caused his health to deteriorate.In an emotional interview with the New York Times, the founder of electric carmaker Tesla also revealed that the pressures of work had caused him to spend his birthday stuck in the Tesla factory and almost miss his brother’s wedding.“This past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career,” he said in the interview.Musk, whose company posted a record $709.6m net loss in the first quarter of this year while struggling to manufacture large numbers of its Model 3 mass-market electric car, said he had been working up to 120 hours a week and his health had been “not great”. He said his friends had been worried about him.Musk said there were times he didn’t leave the factory for three or four days at a time and days when he didn’t go outside.He said he spent the entire 24 hours of his 47th birthday in June at work and flew directly to his brother’s wedding, where he was due to be best man, from work, arriving two hours before the ceremony and leaving immediately afterwards.Musk sparked a furore in the markets, the media and among investors earlier this month when he tweeted his intentions to take his publicly-traded company private, with the assurance: “Funding secured”.Lawyers have warned that his tweet may have broken 14e-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which prohibits publicly traded companies from announcing plans to buy or sell securities if executives don’t intend to complete, don’t have the means to complete, or are trying to manipulate the stock price.In the interview with the New York Times, Musk blamed short-sellers, from whom he said he anticipated “a few months of extreme torture”.“I thought the worst of it was over,” he told the New York Times. “But from a personal standpoint, the worst is yet to come.”He denied “being on weed” at the time of the tweet and said he saw it as an attempt at transparency, but admitted in the interview on Thursday that no-one had seen or reviewed it before he posted it. Observers puzzled over the price he cited.Musk explained that with an estimated premium over recent values, the share price should be around $419. He decided to round it up to $420, he said – a number that is slang for cannabis.“It seemed like better karma at $420 than at $419,” he said in the interview. “But I was not on weed, to be clear. Weed is not helpful for productivity. There’s a reason for the word ‘stoned.’ You just sit there like a stone on weed.”Musk, who is a controversial figure, has drawn further criticism this year for his tweets. Last month he launched an extraordinary attack on one of the British ers involved in the rescue of 12 boys and their football coach who were trapped in a cave in Thailand, baselessly calling the er a “pedo” on Twitter.In June, Musk caused outrage when he responded to a tweet from a woman who claimed Musk had used her father’s unicorn artwork on Tesla merchandise without compensation or attribution, by telling her “He can sue for money if he wants, but that’s kinda lame”. Musk later settled the dispute with the artist.Musk has also lashed out at both the media and analysts from large Wall Street banks in recent months, calling questions from analysts “boring, bonehead questions” and suggesting he would start a website to rank the credibility of inidual journalists, after Tesla received negative press coverage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12007a9d55bdcabfeff37f687e3bfc6eeb16d4bd/563_536_3287_1973/master/3287.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e83ac4671aeef136d00dfaf9dae145c","title":"the community space bringing scandinavian chic to glasgow","story":"For Fika Sake has become the centre of a thriving community in the heart of Scotland’s largest city, as part cafe, part learning space and lifestyle hubThe idea for an events space centred around coffee and cake was inspired by a place where so many good things originate – Scandinavia. Fika is the most recent Swedish tradition spreading across the globe. “It’s about taking time out of your day to actually sit down and maybe relax with someone or maybe yourself – usually over coffee and cake,” says Simon Forsythe, Glasgow-based owner of For Fika Sake.Forsythe’s space is part cafe, part community hangout and part creative workplace. Covering 185 sq m (2,000 sq ft) in the centre of Glasgow, For Fika Sake is drawing in everyone from students and freelancers to yogis and parenting groups who want to engage with other locals and like-minded people while learning something new.Forsythe brought the idea to life in January 2016, opening the doors after a year of planning. “It started when I was having fika at a cafe in town with a friend,” he says. “I was working a part-time job in a normal cafe and was fed up with that experience. She was running music workshops in Glasgow and wanted to work on a different project.” After bringing in one other partner, they came up with the name: For Fika Sake. “We thought up a funny, controversial title, a play on words and we stuck with that and went with it,” says Forsythe.The sense of community created by the cafe extends beyond its doors – the coffee, tea, and cake that give the space its name are sourced from local suppliers. On any day of the week you can walk into For Fika Sake to find people filling the space with music from an old piano donated by a local social enterprise, in pottery workshops run by local artists up on the mezzanine, discussing their latest reads during a book club, or catching up with friends.“It’s great to have this kind of community coming in and using the space for what it was originally designed for,” says Forsythe. “One in particular that stands out is the community for young parents. The big space means they can come in and store their prams in the corner and hang out with other parents and their babies.”After a challenging start, seeing the space come to life has been the big payoff for Forsythe. In December 2016, he had to take on the business himself after his two partners left to pursue other projects. “It was a bit of a shock,” he says. “But the business seems to have taken off since last January.” While he admits it was tough, particularly with the other stresses that come with starting a new small business – like big overheads – he says one of the perks to come out of it is being able to make decisions quickly and easily. “There was no compromise-with-partners involved, so I was able to get things done and out of the way,” he says.Now word of mouth has spread and the business is growing, and that quick decision-making is allowing Forsythe to try new ideas and systems to keep things running smoothly. He recently switched over to a new platform to help him get on top of his cashflow. He chose Square because he liked the “cool and simple” card machine – but also because he could access his funds the next working day.“It’s made a massive difference,” he says. “With this kind of business the most important thing for survival is cashflow, so being able to access your funds the next working day is a serious win. If it’s over the weekend you get your cash on Monday rather than Wednesday.”It’s also given him the time and freedom to focus on drumming up creative ideas for new workshops and events to help the cafe thrive. But if creating a community hub was the grand idea behind the space, it’s the cafe and fostering the tradition around fika that Forsythe reckons is the powerhouse of the enterprise. “It keeps the business going and it creates that space for people to use the workshop side of things,” he says.Using Square’s app, he can create a product button for a new kind of service on the spot – a convenience he appreciates, given the ever-changing use of the space and the introduction of new workshops and events. “Overall, it’s running nice and smoothly and going with that original plan, which is amazing to see.”Where does he see himself next? Hopefully with a second space, in a few years, although perhaps somewhere sunnier. “I’d love to see it grow and take on another premises in another part of Glasgow or potentially in another city,” he says. “But working on what we have right now and just gearing up more towards the community and growing it within this community is still number one.”Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fc65808ba5c259dfa635e60fd906d88014eb1a6/0_77_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b76c23e2462813892a24bdcd64737c2","title":"manchester city the football documentary all or nothing amazon","story":"Docu-series have ruined the reputations of many, from Malcolm Allison to Graham Taylor. Now the Premier League champions have let Amazon’s All or Nothing crew in to the Etihad In the autumn of 1980, Granada TV sent a documentary crew to follow the fortunes of Manchester City, then struggling near the bottom of the old First Division, and their manager Malcolm Allison. At the time, Allison was one of football’s great outsized figures, a cigar-smoking, fedora-wearing rent-a-gob who also happened to be a visionary coach – albeit one whose reputation for motivating players was very much on the slide by the time Granada’s cameras arrived at Maine Road.Aired in 1981, CITY! A Club in Crisis, is a sometimes toe-curling, entirely engrossing, all-access account of the end of Allison’s reign at the club. In the space of an hour of television, Allison watches his City side lose two crucial matches, is summarily sacked by oleaginous chairman Peter Swales, and then returns to the club for an FA Cup tie as manager of Crystal Palace, where the team are soundly beaten by his old charges. To make matters worse, his replacement at City is former teammate John Bond. In a post-match press conference, Bond issues a withering critique of Allison’s management style, all while Allison sits in silence a few seats away, cigar in gob, eyes fixed murderously on the middle-distance.More than three decades on from the broadcast of A Club in Crisis comes All or Nothing, another behind-the-scenes account of life at Manchester City, although one that, name aside, seems to concern an entirely different club. Long gone are the mahogany-panelled boardrooms of Maine Road, replaced by the gleaming glass-fronted offices of City’s Etihad stadium and new academy complex. In the place of Swales, who made his money through a TV rentals company, the club is led by member of a widely condemned Middle East oil dynasty, and – most strikingly of all – the shambling, “cups for cock-ups” City of the 80s, 90s and 00s has been usurped by the serial winners of the Pep Guardiola era.All or Nothing, the latest instalment of an Amazon franchise that has so far profiled the All Blacks rugby union team as well as multiple NFL outfits, follows Guardiola’s side in the season where they amassed a record 100 points. Narrated by Ben Kingsley, it’s a glossy, behind-the-scenes look at the inner workings of a side at their peak. Ahead of its launch, its creators trumpeted the “unprecedented access” they had received from the club, and it certainly wasn’t an idle boast, with the footage taking in treatment rooms, transfer negotiations and everything in between.In truth, City have become the sort of outfit which should really run a mile from the all-access documentary. Because, historically, the medium has been one where reputations, rather than enhanced, are destroyed. Just ask John Sitton, former manager of Leyton Orient and subject of Channel 4’s 1995 doc Club for a Fiver. Ostensibly a film about the financial struggles of the-then second ision side, it is now more famous for the volcanic outbursts delivered by Sitton to his beleaguered squad, one of which ends with him offering to have “a right sort-out” with two of his charges. Sitton’s managerial career never recovered, and his career has since taken in stints as a martial arts expert, football data expert and taxi driver.Sitton’s is by no means the only legacy-shredding meltdown to have been captured for posterity by a no-doubt delighted camera crew. The England boss Graham “do I not like that” Taylor famously suffered the same indignity in Channel 4’s Cutting Edge doc An Impossible Job, a film that provided confirmation that dressing rooms are extremely sweary places: Taylor’s 38 uses of the word ”fuck” in the documentary was a record number for a British TV broadcast at the time.Taylor’s impressive effort was bested three years later by Peterborough boss Barry Fry’s 48 uses of the expletive in Anglia’s There’s Only One Barry Fry. Peterborough and Fry would return to the screen just under a decade later in Sky One’s Big Ron Manager, which saw the disgraced coach and pundit attempt to rebuild his career by mentoring Posh manager Steve Bleasdale. Things didn’t quite go to plan: annoyed by Atkinson’s incessant input, Bleasdale quit two games from the end of the season.For clubs on their uppers, such as Orient or Peterborough, which were reportedly paid £200,000 by Sky for the privilege of Big Ron’s presence, the promise of cash and the potential for exposure is worth the danger of embarrassment. That riskreward is less enticing for clubs further up football’s food chain, which is perhaps why bigger clubs have historically been more cautious in allowing access to their inner sanctums, choosing instead to release their own controlled behind-the-scenes footage on inhouse TV networks such as MUTV, or club websites.What seems to have changed things is the rise of US sports franchises such as HBO’s NFL series Hard Knocks and the earlier seasons of All or Nothing, both of which present a high-octane, access-all-areas form of documentary that – crucially – still seem to present the subject sport in a positive light. Such series, with their focus on narrative and personality rather than technical details, are also well-suited to international markets that might not be au fait with said sports.In recent years, a similar model of documentary has been tentatively adopted in football, beginning with the 2012 series Being Liverpool, which followed the club’s progress over the course of a pre-season. That effort was slated for lacking decent access, although it did at least provide some eye-opening footage of manager Brendan Rodgers’ curious motivational methods, which included warning his squad that he had the names of three players who will “let us down this year” in a trio of envelopes. Then last year came Netflix’s First Team: Juventus, which offered higher stakes, taking place as it did across a full Serie A season, but still received criticism for lacking “moments of vulnerability”.Certainly going by early previews All or Nothing is a sizeable upgrade on Being Liverpool and First Team. The series sets out its intentions at the start of its first episode, with footage of Guardiola delivering a manic team talk at half time of the League Cup final. Later in the same episode, the cameras are allowed to linger as the team’s left back Benjamin Mendy is told the extent of his ultimately season-ending cruciate ligament injury.At times, as when midfielder David Silva discusses the premature birth of his son, or Sergio Agüero is filmed alone at home, a continent away from his young son, the series proves genuinely moving. Indeed, the access granted All or Nothing is sufficiently unprecedented to have reportedly angered Sky, which in all its years broadcasting the Premier League, has never been given the opportunity to film half-time team talks or bust-ups in the tunnel.At the same time, City’s blanket promotion of All or Nothing on their various social media channels indicates that there’s nothing here that they’d prefer to keep buried. The club have said that they did not have editorial say on the final cut of the series, although were allowed to veto legally iffy or commercially sensitive scenes, and what is on show is less warts and all than charming imperfections. That’s understandable given that Amazon itself has a stake in the success of the Premier League and, by extension, its best club, with its rights to one of the league’s live broadcast packages beginning next season.Still as different as this gleaming, modern documentary might seem to its grittier, grubbier predecessors, one thing remains pleasingly unchanged: the swearing. Before the opening credit sequence has rolled, Guardiola has managed three fucks and a middle finger. It’s not quite Fry and Taylor levels, but at least a grand old footballing tradition remains unchanged.Six Days to Saturday (1963)The week in the life of a scarily young Swindon Town team is the focus of this early all-access doc, one that features the amusing sight of the County Ground’s caretaker shooing pigeons from the stadium’s rafters with a rifle.United (1990)Not every great football documentary ends with failure: this six-part BBC series follows Harry Bassett’s Sheffield United as they battle their way back to the top flight for the first time in decades. Each episode follows a different aspect of the club: players, fans, wives, board, apprentices and the manager.Premier Passions (1998)Blackly comic five-parter about Sunderland’s 1997 relegation from the Premier League, which came just as they were constructing the gleaming new stadium that they hoped would cement their status among the elite. A new film, following Sunderland’s relegation to football’s third tier, is due later this year.The Four Year Plan (2009)Described by the ’s Michael Hann as “the most vivid insight into the running of a football club committed to film”, this follows owners Flavio Briatore and Bernie Ecclestone’s “four-year plan” to get Queens Park Rangers into the top flight. They got there eventually, although not before sacking a staggering number of managers.All or Nothing: Manchester City is available on Amazon"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/736869b443e87efcacb0968724adf38b35bf0d2e/616_478_3303_1982/master/3303.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34bc0ad12fa185c93c57f4a129708168","title":"eamon martin ireland catholic primate priests need spread word home pope francis visit","story":"Primate of all Ireland calls for ‘new evangelisation’ ahead of Pope Francis’s visit to DublinCatholic priests in Ireland need to be missionaries in their own country to meet the challenges of a changing society, Eamon Martin, the most senior church figure in Ireland, has said ahead of the pope’s visit to Dublin next weekend.“We are in mission territory in many ways as Catholics in Ireland,” Martin, who is archbishop of Armagh as well as primate of all Ireland, told the .“Ireland was always renowned as a missionary country, sending priests all over the world to spread the Catholic faith. But there’s a need for mission here in Ireland now, a need for a new evangelisation.”In the four decades since the last papal visit to Ireland, that of John Paul II in 1979, the country has seen a steep decline in the numbers of people attending mass and the moral authority of the church has been shattered by revelations of child sexual abuse and mistreatment of vulnerable women in the Magdalene Laundries.Ireland was a “very different society” today, said Martin. “Actually, to be honest, it’s a much more exciting and challenging place to be a priest and a pastor than to be part of some kind of big systemic culture in Ireland in which everyone does everything because that’s what the church said they have to do. Those days are long gone.”Pope Francis has faced calls to address issues such as the legacy of sexual abuse and its cover-up, LGBT rights and the role of women in the church during his 36-hour visit to the World Meeting of Families.“Sometimes people ask me: ‘Do you think the church can draw a line under the issue?’ I really don’t think we can.“When you meet survivors of abuse, they never draw a line under it. It’s with them for the rest of their lives – the horrific betrayal of trust, the sins and the crimes of the church, our shameful efforts at avoiding scandal which in the end created more scandal … It’s a shadow that’s there all the time.”The “awful, heinous wound on the body of the church” was not just a matter for local parishes or dioceses to deal with. “This is a systemic issue for the whole church. This is not an isolated issue of a bad priest in a particular school or parish. This is an issue where the whole culture of our church wrongly facilitated abuse.“Pope Francis can offer something, speaking on behalf of the church universal, that could be extremely helpful for all of us – survivors and those of us doing our best to deal with the legacy, the awful hurt and trauma that this issue has left.”Although other institutions and organisations in society were also facing up to the legacy of abuse and cover-up, the Catholic church could provide a model of “how a worldwide institution can accept its responsibility and then become, please God, at some stage instrumental in the healing of the terrible hurts that have happened. Pope Francis is the sort of person who can lead us on that journey.”He added: “Francis, ever since he arrived on the scene, has been challenging for all of us. He’s pushed us to consider the marginalised, the disadvantaged, to reach out to migrants, the homeless, to those forgotten in the normal day-to-day discussions in the public square. A lot of what he has said has disturbed our comfort as a church.”The archbishop said there was a “clerical culture” in Ireland, in which leadership was seen to be priests or bishops. “There are a lot of women already playing central leadership roles. We have outstanding women leading up our Catholic schools, for example, but if they do not feel affirmed in their role then we are failing and I’m saddened,” he said.In response to criticism and claims of exclusion from LGBT groups, he said for the first time the World Meeting of Families will host two panel discussions on how the church can “reach out to families struggling with this issue”.“How can we be faithful members of our church and present our teaching in a truthful, yet loving and merciful, way to all our children? That for me is the challenge,” Martin said.“Many groups feel excluded, feel we are insensitive in our language and our approach. The WMF wants to be welcoming, but people must realise this is an event of the Catholic church.”Martin was disappointed that Francis would not be visiting Northern Ireland during his brief visit, but hoped the pope would address the situation there.“I think he should affirm our efforts for peace. People are still carrying the wounds and traumas of the Troubles. I would love Pope Francis’s presence to speak to these people who are suffering because of conflict, war and violence in Ireland and other parts of the world.”He expected “thousands upon thousands” of people from Northern Ireland to travel south to see the pope, and said he would continue to invite Francis to make a papal visit to the north."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3598775.1534449802!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dup and sinn f%C3%A9in accused of abdication of responsibility over brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLisa Chambers accused the DUP of willingly ensuring that Stormont institutions are kept suspended because it suits the party’s agenda at Westminster. Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillMs Chambers, the party’s spokeswoman on Brexit, accused both parties of an “abdication of responsibility” in collapsing the Stormont institutions over the past 20 months. Speaking at the Parnell Summer School on the theme of ‘21st Century Democracy: Opportunities and Threats’, she said it was “remarkable” that the voices of Northern Ireland politicians were not being heard on Brexit. She pointed out that the only Northern Ireland representatives in Westminster are the DUP who are pro-Brexit, even though the majority of people in the North voted for the UK to remain in the EU. She accused the DUP of willingly ensuring that Stormont institutions are kept suspended because it suits the party’s agenda at Westminster and she said Sinn Féin was playing into its hands with its abstentionist policy. “These MPs matter all the more because since that disastrous snap election that Theresa May called where she lost her majority, their numbers are currently keeping May’s government in power,” she said. “The collapse of power-sharing in Stormont, with no imminent sign of its return, further adds to the imbalance in Northern Ireland’s democratic voice.” She accused the Government of “megaphone diplomacy” in relation to the backstop agreement that followed in the aftermath of the December agreement between the EU and the UK. There it was agreed that Northern Ireland would retain regulatory alignment with the EU if no deal could be reached between the EU and the UK. She said it created unnecessary tensions in Anglo-Irish relations and among Unionists. Speaking on the same platform at the Parnell School, former Siptu president Jack O’Connor, who will be a Labour party candidate in the forthcoming general election, said he too believed the Government had oversold the backstop arrangement agreed last December. Mr O’Connor said in his experience of 42-years as a union leader, he had learned the dangers of overselling deals. “The more you hype what you have achieved in negotiation, the more difficult it is for the people you negotiate with. The more you jeopardise the potential for the next agreement,” he explained. “This was a time for a more mature approach.” Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

His only rival, Shahbaz Sharif of the ousted Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), won 96 votes, Qaiser said, with some opposition parties including the third-largest Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) abstaining from the vote.The result brings him one step closer to ending decades of rotating leadership between the PML-N and the PPP, punctuated by periods of military rule.Imran Khan has had to be very flexible indeed on his long climb to power in PakistanKhan, clad in a waistcoat and traditional white shalwar kameez garments, smiled broadly and could be seen wiping tears from his eyes while clutching prayer beads as the count was announced.He had appeared relaxed before the vote, smiling and shaking hands with other parliamentarians, including Sharif.The former cricketer, who captained Pakistan to World Cup victory in 1992, won the July 25 election but fell short of an outright majority, forcing him to partner with smaller parties and independents in order to form a government.Some television channels flashed archive images of Khan during his 1992 triumph as the vote was announced.The election was branded Pakistan\u0027s dirtiest, after widespread claims through the campaign that the powerful military was trying to fix the playing field against the PML-N and in Khan\u0027s favour.Rival parties have alleged blatant vote-rigging, with several parliamentarians shouting protest slogans inside the assembly ahead of the vote.

In our case we didn\u0027t find any biomolecular traces of proteins resulting from natural fermentation of milk, Mr Greco said.3,300-year-old cheese was in the tomb of Ptahmes, the former mayor of MemphisThe jar had been covered in a canvas to preserve the cheese.The scientists investigated its contents using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, the American Chemical Society said. The tests showed the cheese had been made from a mixture of cow and sheep, or goat, milk. They also revealed that the sample was laced with Bricella melitensis, which can be deadly to humans.But the cheese\u0027s taste is a mystery.We do not have much information on what the taste could be, we know it was made mostly from sheep\u0027s and goat\u0027s milk, Mr Greco said.But for me it\u0027s really hard to imagine a specific flavour. I\u0027m Italian, I love cheese and I know how much they can change in flavour and appearance even with very few differences in ingredients and process.It is these small variations and the specificities in the regional processes that have allowed the development of so many varieties in my country.Please review our commenting policy\u0026#39Book bragging\u0026#39 row as author\u0026#39s claim to be reading 50 books at the same time is criticised by fellow writers India warns of \u0026#39extremely grave\u0026#39 crisis as death toll rises to 324 in worst flooding for 100 yearsNo children?

A recent Reuters analysis of the financial books of South Pacific island nations showed China\u0027s lending programmes have gone from almost zero to over $1.3 billion currently outstanding in a decade.The high debt burdens among small economies with little earning power has stoked fears the region could fall into financial distress and become more susceptible to diplomatic pressure from Beijing.China\u0027s Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the statement. It has also not yet commented on Pōhiva\u0027s original remarks.China has previously said it retained good relations with Tonga and there was no evidence China was responsible for creating unsustainable debt in the region.Despite holding little economic sway, each small Pacific state represents a vote at the United Nations. They also control vast swathes of resource-rich ocean and hold strategic military significance.The issue of Chinese debt levels - Tonga owes $115 million to Beijing, representing about one-third the size of its annual gross domestic product - has become more pressing after China took possession of a Sri Lankan port as Colombo struggled with a spiralling debt crisis.China had never threatened to take assets from Tonga in any way, Pōhiva said in the statement.Tonga is due to start an onerous principal repayment schedule of its Chinese debt in September.Please review our commenting policy\u0026#39Book bragging\u0026#39 row as author\u0026#39s claim to be reading 50 books at the same time is criticised by fellow writers India warns of \u0026#39extremely grave\u0026#39 crisis as death toll rises to 324 in worst flooding for 100 yearsNo children?

She has adopted four Malawian children and was in the country to celebrate the first anniversary of the Mercy James Centre for Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care, named after one of her adopted daughtersMadonna and Jean Paul Gaultier arrive for the 2018 Met Gala But there is one area where the older woman is suddenly and somewhat unexpectedly thriving – rock music. Madonna celebrates her 60th birthday on Saturday. Kate Bush has just celebrated hers. In fact, they are the spring chickens. Suzi Quatro, 68, and Patti Smith, 71, are not just still rocking, they are still snarling. Cher at 72 pops up with a delightful cameo in the Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspmovie. The queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, is still recording at 76.\u0026nbspWho’d have thought it? Look back to the 1960s and there were precious few women at all in pop music, let alone older ones. In the UK, Sandie Shaw, Dusty Springfield, Marianne Faithfull and a handful of others carried the fight to the mass of male groups (the word boyband had yet to be invented).No one thought then about whether the stars would still be recording and performing in old age. Indeed the concept was unthinkable – for men as well as women, for stars as well as fans. When I put it to Paul McCartney that he must be surprised to be still going, he replied: “I do rub my eyes. I didn’t foresee it. In The Beatles we always said 10 years. But it kept on and kept on and it kept being good and we seemed to be the people who could do it. Now there is a great young generation of people who can also do it, but it tends to be that the people packing them in are the people who have the material, have hits, songs people know, and I think that’s important. I think they have stagecraft, they have an ability with an audience.”There’s no doubting that the likes of Madonna and Kate Bush have stagecraft in spades. Even in an industry that ostensibly prizes youthfulness and a certain amount of athleticism on stage, the female superstars, like the male, are now gliding into pensionable age, with fan bases, voices, charisma and downright sexiness still intact.\u0026nbspThough, when it comes to longevity, the women themselves didn’t always think it would be the case. Joni Mitchell once remarked, all too despondently: “Record companies want the look. And if you’re over 50, however well preserved, you just don’t have the look.”Maybe the look, or audience perception of the look, has changed. No one remotely cared that Kate Bush looked older than they remembered her (quelle surprise) when she made her stage comeback after 35 years in 2014. And tickets were inevitably like gold dust. I was there to note that she sounded the same, and she still exuded charisma and stage presence.She did a staggering run of 22 performances. Two things perhaps attested to the more mature Kate. The show was only part rock concert, it was also part theatre with video and dance, and even the odd comedy sketch starring her son. Also, she gave all her audiences an instruction on her website, which bore witness to the fact that she comes from an earlier generation than today’s performers. She wrote: “I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras.”Suzi, 68,\u0026nbspsays she\u0027ll \u0027retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is\u0026nbspsilence\u0027 (Getty)\u0026nbspEarlier this year I witnessed the return to live performance of Annie Lennox, at the age of 63. To raise funds for her charity she did a one-off show which was largely a chat show, interspersed with the odd song at the piano, going through her life and career. The self-deprecating humour was erting: “When I was studying at the Royal Academy of Music, I lived on £3 a week.” Pause. “Scottish people can do that.” Pause. “And we like it.”Perhaps she had stumbled across the format for the older star, a chat show setting interspersed with the odd song. Except, at the end that she knocked everyone there for six with a breathtaking 30 minute performance of Eurythmics and solo hits that showed she retained all her talent. She was the epitome of soul as she belted out Eurythmics anthems, sometimes crawling sensuously across the floor as she did so. The only surprise was that she had (lamentably) eschewed live performance for 10 years.For some female legends, the routine can be tiring. I was at Marianne Faithfull’s most recent London appearance, an intimate show at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club. Plagued by a variety of physical problems over the years, she had a walking stick and performed most of the show sitting down. It was nevertheless a beguiling evening. But notably at one point she actually pleaded with her fans to allow her to retire. “Please let me go,” she said, “I can’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith,” referring to her long-time friend Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, definitely not one of life’s quitters.Madonna, too, is not one of life’s quitters. Her fitness routine keeps her more than show-ready, even for a show as heavy on breathless choreography as hers. But I think there is another clue to her longevity in what she said to the audience at one of her shows that I attended 15 years ago. Just before her final encore, she said in idiosyncratic style: “When I was a girl I always thought ‘grown-ups can f**k off’. But now I’m 45 years old, I have children of my own, and you know what, grown-ups can still f**k off!”As I say, it was a piece of philosophy delivered in her personal style. But it perhaps partly explains her longevity and continuing appeal. She retains the anarchic spirit she had when she burst on the scene. Female rock stars, just like their male counterparts, and possibly more so, have no intention of growing old gracefully. They haven’t just retained their vocal prowess and stage presence, they have retained the hint of adolescent rebelliousness that has always been an intrinsic part of rock’s appeal. And having met both Madonna and Suzi Quatro, I can attest that in both cases the aggressive, in yer face attitude is not just a stage technique.But rock-star rebelliousness is not the only reason that rock and pop’s biggest female stars go on and on or come back after long absences. Kate Bush was never keen on playing live and before her comeback had only done one tour of the country. But she was persuaded to perform again by her teenage son. As she had a song on one album about watching his clothes go round and round in the washing machine, it was clear that a request from him would, fortunately, carry weight.Victoria Beckham is, of course, far from the vintage of Bush, Madonna and the other older stars. But when the Spice Girls had their reunion tour, it’s interesting that she said the key reason she wanted to do it was that her children had seen Dad play football and knew all about his skills. Now was a chance for them “to see what Mummy did” before they were born.Performing for a global audience is important. But performing for the family clearly also is a factor in keeping the career going.Jonathan Morrish, a long-time senior executive at Sony record company, and now a music industry PR consultant, says: “Women generally live longer than men, so it should come as no surprise that so many as they get older seem to flourish creatively with their music and on stage. None of this is easy. I know from the many artists that I have worked with you need tenacity. So perhaps it’s the staying power they had to show at the beginning of their careers, perhaps a savvy emotional intelligence –\u0026nbspwhatever it is, I admire and welcome it. And applaud them.”\u0026nbspAnd even for those female rock and pop stars who have decided to call it a day, a new avenue has opened up: the stage musical. Right now in London, audiences can see Tina Turner on stage at one theatre, and The Supremes and all the other Motown stars at another. Or at least, one can enjoy their music and life stories, delivered by lookalikes and sound-alikes. It’s possible not just to go on into old age, but literally forever.Faithfull pleaded with a crowd at Ronnie Scotts: \u0027Please let me go. I\u0026nbspcan’t go on for ever.

That is why my trade union, Community, is backing\u0026nbspThe Independent’s Final Say\u0026nbspcampaign, to secure a people’s vote on the final deal.”Contribute to the march of a generationAt the last People’s Vote March in June, well over 100,000 people marched on parliament.Community’s roots are in textile manufacturing and the steel industry – pushed to the brink of collapse in recent years as much larger economies such as China distort international markets.In 2018 the industry has faced new pressure in particular from steel tariffs imposed by Donald Trump’s US administration, which Brexiteers are relying on for a favourable future trade deal.Community also supports prison and justice workers, logistics, finance, politics and public affairs staff, the charity and freelance sectors and is affiliated to the Labour\u0026nbspParty.Mr Rickhuss highlighted London School of Economics data concluding Brexit was already costing the average UK household more than £404 a year by June 2017.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline

“profoundly different to those presented in 2016”, branding the promise of £350m a week for the NHS “worthless” and the guarantee that European trade would not be harmed as “at best a mistake, and at worst a deliberate lie.”The general secretary added: “When Theresa May believes she has got the best outcome she can, then she must come back and allow us to decide if her best is\u0026nbspgood enough.When Theresa May believes she has got the best outcome she can, then she must come back and allow us to decide if her best is good enough.\u0026nbsp If that outcome is rejected, then all options should be on the table“If that outcome is rejected, then all options should be on the table, including reopening negotiations with Europe and retaining the status quo.“Community would not shy away from asking our members to vote on important or difficult issues in the workplace our politicians must do the right thing and give the people a Final Say on their future.”The People’s Vote launched in April demanding a referendum on the deal agreed with the EU\u0026nbspand has a grassroots network of around 1 million people, holding rallies and action days across the country.The Independent launched its own Final Say campaign three weeks ago,\u0026nbspso far gathering 615,000 names to its petition along with a string of political endorsements.In June this year more than 100,000 people from all walks of life marched on parliament to demand their democratic voice be heard in a new Brexit referendum.But following the newly forged alliance, the People’s Vote and The Independent March for the Future, on Saturday 20 October\u0026nbspin London, is set to be much larger.Ireland is closer than ever to unification because of BrexitWhy hasn’t the NHS been prioritised in Brexit negotiations?No-deal Brexit ‘will raise risk of disease outbreaks’Why has John McDonnell’s constituency changed its mind on Brexit?Senior Conservative asks constituents if they want new Brexit voteIt received backing from British film star Dominic West today, who said: “Please sign the petition, join us on our march, and let’s get a people’s vote to say that we won’t be dictated to.”The gathering, with young people whose voices were not heard two years ago at its forefront, will constitute one of the most significant demonstrations in British history – just as Ms May returns from Brussels from a critical Brexit summit.Amatey Doku, vice-president of the 7\u0026nbspmillion-strong National Union of Students and a supporter of the For our Future’s Sake group that backs a new referendum, said: “This Tory government, unfortunately assisted by the Labour Party,\u0026nbspthreaten to harm young people’s futures.Rees-Mogg suggests a second Brexit referendum would be acceptable in clip from 2011“That’s why students across the country are coming together for the People’s Vote and The Independent March for the Future. Students and young people can no longer be ignored – and on 20 October, we won’t be.”The prime minister had once aimed to have a deal agreed with Europe earlier this summer, but with negotiations badly stalling and a major cabinet fallout, expectations turned to the October summit.British ministers privately admit it is now unlikely the UK will be able to agree a deal even by October, with a special summit potentially needed before Christmas – leaving just three months in the new year for the UK and the EU to ratify any agreement.It is also unclear if Ms May will be able to navigate any deal across her party’s deep isions, with the European Research Group of backbench Tory MPs drawing up alternative proposals highlighting the benefits of a no-deal Brexit.An exclusive poll carried out by BMG Research this week found that 48 per cent of the public would now back a vote on any deal struck between the UK and the EU – up from 44 per cent just four weeks ago.Just 24 per cent opposed the idea, down three points over the same period. Only 14 per cent of the 1,500 people surveyed supported Ms May’s chequers deal given a choice.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/13/17/10389288-655005147930072-2863546592063103558-n.jpg  width= 885  height= 663  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/13/17/10389288-655005147930072-2863546592063103558-n.jpg","title":"jeremy corbyn wreath laying latest ipso complaint labour party press regulator","story":"Created with Sketch.Stories have misrepresented 2014 event at cemetery, the people buried there, and role of Palestinian leaders, party saysClick to followIndy PoliticsLabour complains to press regulator over coverage of Jeremy Corbyn wreath-layingLabour has complained to\u0026nbspthe press regulator Ipso over coverage of Jeremy Corbyn’s laying of a wreath at a Tunisian cemetery.The party said stories published in the , Daily Mail, Daily ,  , Times\u0026nbspand Sun had misrepresented the 2014 event and who it was intended to commemorate.Lodging a formal complaint with the\u0026nbsppress regulator\u0026nbspis highly unusual for the\u0026nbspleader of a political party.\u0026nbspCoverage in recent days has embroiled the Labour leader in a huge row and led to him being criticised by Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel.It originally erupted after the Daily Mail published pictures of Mr Corbyn holding a wreath at a Tunis cemetery\u0026nbspwhich it claimed were taken in front of a plaque honouring Palestinian leaders allegedly linked to Black\u0026nbspSeptember, the\u0026nbspterrorist group behind the 1972 Munich massacre that\u0026nbspkilled 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team and one police officer.Mr Corbyn has said he only laid a wreath at the cemetery in memory\u0026nbspof victims of a 1985 Israeli air strike on a Palestinian base in Tunisia.

If so, and the source of the complaint has not yet contacted the original publisher, they are usually referred back to them, though in some cases the regulator may immediately begin its own investigation.If Ipso does launch its own investigation, that process ordinarily involves mediation with the publication involved. But if that fails, the body will make its own ruling on whether the editors’ code of conduct has been breached.In the case of Mr Corbyn that could eventually lead to Ipso having to rule on the accuracy of the reports, and, therefore, the sequence of events in Tunisia.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/11/09/06/ilhan-omar-1.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/11/09/06/ilhan-omar-1.jpg","title":"ilhan omar wins minnesota democratic primary victory speech watch","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027In my last race, I talked about what my win would have meant for that eight-year-old girl in that refugee camp,\u0027 she tells crowdClick to followThe Independent USIlhan Omar, who is likely to become the first Somali-American elected to US Congress, made history on Tuesday by winning a seat in Minnesota’s 5th Congressional District.The politician garnered national attention just two years ago after becoming the first Somali American elected to a state legislature in Minnesota - unseating a 22-term Democratic incumbent.In my last race, I talked about what my win would have meant for that eight-year-old girl in that refugee camp,” she told a crowd of supporters after her win.\u0026nbspJahana Hayes could be Connecticut\u0027s first black Democrat in CongressTransgender candidate Christine Hallquist makes history in VermontAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez supports Kaniela Ing in Hawaii primaries“And today, today, I still think about her and I think about the kind of hope and optimism all of those eight-year-olds around the country and around the world get from seeing your beautiful faces elect and believe in someone like me.“So I humbly thank you.

For many women and their partners, a miscarriage means the loss of a baby and the hopes and the dreams for that child,” she told The Independent.\u0026nbsp“It would give people the time out you need when you have been bereaved. It acknowledges a miscarriage is a significant event and this is even true for people who don’t take the leave.”She said the discussion the proposed bill had provoked\u0026nbspwas helping to reduce the taboo which surrounds miscarriages.\u0026nbspSome other countries have provisions for paid leave if a woman miscarries. Indian law instructs that women are eligible to six weeks’ leave if they miscarry a baby. However, the overwhelming majority of employees in the country carry out informal work so not many are entitled to it.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/183x122/1004447_1.jpg","title":"Brexit news Theresa May no deal papers preparation Dominic Raab Michel Barnier Jeremy Hunt","story":"The reports, acquired by BuzzFeed News, will cover issues including aviation security, batch testing of medicines, and work place rights.The list has been compiled from Government departments across Whitehall, and will outline the wide-ranging impacts of Brexit on all areas of British life.A spokesman from the Department for Exiting the EU (DExEU) commented on the leaks, stating: \u0026ldquoWe don\u0026rsquot comment on leaks or speculation.\u0026ldquoHowever, as we\u0026rsquove already made clear, inidual departments are preparing specific technical notices to help citizens, businesses and consumers to prepare for March 2019 in the unlikely event of a \u0027no-deal\u0027 scenario.

It means young people are missing out on essential skills as they approach adulthood.GRANT ROLLINGS asked five Sun columnists what their first part-time jobs were and the valuable lessons they learned – from being polite to skiving.I ALWAYS had a summer job, usually it meant working full-time hours on my normal Saturday job as holiday cover. This was either in a boutique such as Chelsea Girl or in BHS, where I worked on the sweetie counter.I coped with the boredom by sneakily munching on the best chocolate sweets from the pick-and-mix. I also worked as a waitress in a trendy Glasgow eaterie during the holidays.All of these jobs gave me the most enormous respect for the men and women who toil for long hours, often dealing with unreasonable members of the public for too little pay and not much prospect of promotion.Working in the service industry taught me the power of a disarming smile, and proved that my old granny’s saying that “you get more in life from sugar than vinegar” could not be more true.Grumpy customers demanding refunds and diners moaning that they had been waiting too long for their main course were usually placated with a swift apology and a promise to sort things out.A major restaurant blunder could often be smoothed over with a free coffee or pudding.MY favourite summer job came in 1977. I was a traffic enumerator for Middlesbrough Council. That meant I spent all day counting cars. All the way up one side of Linthorpe Road, all the way back down the other.I had to write down all the number plates. In the end, I got a bit bored and spent the time hanging out at my mate’s T-shirt shop or Fearnley Records and made the numbers up, always remembering to have them end in the local codes of HN or (I think) XG. I hope the council thought it worthwhile.It was better than the glue factory, where I’d been very briefly working on a weighbridge. Foreman pressed a button and this vast door opened and thousands of rotting animal carcasses fell out. I can still smell it now, all these years later. I passed out — soft lad, you see.Or there was working the nightshift pricing cans of food and stuff in Hintons, the local convenience store. Every time I turned up, the manager would say, ‘Here he is, the poor man’s Rod Stewart’.A friend of mine, Mark, had a much better summer job.He was a Club 18-30 holiday rep. He shagged 21 girls in 25 days, which gave me my first story to sell to the national newspapers.MY first holiday job was in the summer of 1985 when I was 16 years old. I had already been turned down from working at Waitrose in Enfield Town on the basis I was “too glamorous”.That just goes to show how far we have come in such a short time. I have never set foot in a Waitrose since that day because I was beyond furious. Anyway, the job I did get was working in a hairdresser’s on Goodge Street in London.My journey involved three changes and about 14 stops every day. The job was meant to be answering the phone, sweeping up and generally helping out, but before the end of the first week I was running the till, the appointment system, cashing up and generally managing the place.The only thing I could not do was cut hair, but that didn’t stop me cutting my friends’ hair — with very mixed results, more bad than good — on the basis I worked in a hairdresser’s so they thought I should. I remember the liberating feeling of earning my own money, it gave me the greatest sense of independence, self-esteem and self-belief.I worked out I was actually good in a work environment, talking to people — for example, talking women into perms they didn’t want — being responsible, handling money and making a difference to my employer.The biggest transition we make in our lives is leaving education to go into the workplace, and summer jobs prepare you for this.I HAD dozens of summer jobs, from working as a scaffolder’s mate with a convicted murderer, who kept a pistol in the glove compartment of his Ford Escort, to donning a white suit and Geiger counter to carry out maintenance on the core of the main reactor at a nuclear power station.I learned a hundred things from each and every job, but it was working as a grocery assistant at my local supermarket that had the most impact.My best friend and I both got jobs there at the same time. He was a star performer at school, a brilliant academic, but he couldn’t take the pace and got fired after a couple of months.It was incredibly hard, repetitive work.The manager was an ex-Army major — very strict on haircuts, discipline and stealing.There was always the prospect of the Tannoy announcement “customer service one hundred”, which was code for a shoplifter having been spotted.All the male floor staff were required to assemble at till number one to tackle the suspect, who would sometimes become violent.I was much happier making the cheese look pretty and eventually became the ruler of the entire soft dairy aisle — a project I’m still working on.I WAS 13 in Brownes Wine bar, Stafford Street, Derby, summer 1987, some years before it burned down in mysterious circumstances (has a bar ever burnt down innocently?). I was chief bottler-up.This involved the soul-sapping exercise of sifting through bins taller than me for all the recyclable bottles from the previous night’s festivities and putting them in their correct crates. This took all morning and you ended up cut to shreds and stinking of Britvic and Schlitz.I was then asked to be the cook — this involved microwaving lasagne for drunk people. I was paid the princely sum of £3 per hour. I realised how crap this was, so one scorching Saturday I nicked the shampoo that came with my dad’s company car and took advantage of the sketchy Eighties attitude to drink-driving and washed all the customers’ cars in the car park for a fiver a pop.I literally cleaned up. It was the greatest Dragons’ Den moment I’ve ever had. I waxed on and off all day, rinsing my dad of his prized BMW product. He arrived to pick me up and I was minted. A 13-year-old with £64 in his pocket. That coveted Swatch would finally be mine.He then told me the dog had been run over, so that’s another memory ruined.Thanks for reminding me.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To say that he was “present but not involved” is an insult to voters’ intelligence when photographs show him holding a wreath and gurning for a nearby camera.To allow his press office to say the widows of those murdered in Munich were being “misled” is, even among the many shameful episodes we’ve seen since he became Labour leader three hate-filled years ago, disgraceful.The most vital qualification for power in this country must be integrity. And Jeremy Corbyn has demonstrated this week that he has absolutely none of it.But for all of the shame that he brings upon Labour, it is nothing compared to the spinelessness of the party’s “moderate” MPs whose opposition to Corbyn extends not much further than wishy-washy tweets.“Present but not involved” isn’t an excuse for Corbyn but nor is it for the cowards on Labour’s backbenches.Corbyn cannot be allowed near government. But the rest of the party has lost the public’s faith too.TOMORROW, official figures are likely to suggest that train fares will go up by another 3.5 per cent in January.If you’re a commuter who has put up with delayed and cancelled trains, you’ll be wondering what you’re paying for.After a disastrous year, there is no other industry that would turn round and ask customers for even more.The failure of the Government to take responsibility, blaming unions or claiming the cash is for “investment”, is simply not good enough. It’s the same as last year’s excuse.It is time for a radical overhaul — but that does not mean nationalisation. Far from it. Our railways need MORE private sector involvement.The hybrid system we have, in which private operators rely on publicly owned tracks and have their fares regulated by government, has led us into the worst of both worlds.Transport supremo Chris Grayling needs to take on the unions once and for all. And he needs to introduce real competition on the railways, giving operators far more freedom.Commuters deserve better than finger-pointing and higher fares.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He says he was told that he couldn’t speak at the wedding and that Harry berated him on the phone for mishandling the Press while he was recovering from a heart attack.The official royal response to these outbursts has been, effectively, to shove their fingers in their ears and shout la-la-la (or lah-lah-lah).The snobby courtiers and hangers-on dismiss Markle père as fame-hungry.That’s not altogether wrong — he is clearly desperate, as he proved by posing for snaps with the paparazzi in the run-up to the wedding.But it’s not good enough to wish he’d just go away.Meghan is now one of the most photographed and sought-after women in the world. Her very well-paid PR flunkies should have seen these familial landmines a mile off and defused them.But they have failed.Thomas Markle is a difficult and proud man, no doubt. But that is why he should have been treated with care, not frozen out.Why did Team Windsor not find him a role and approach him long before the wedding to make sure he didn’t feel excluded.It’s hard not to feel for him.His ex, Meghan’s mother Doria, was hailed as one of the stars of the wedding.Because she’s a black woman, she invited lots of gushing commentary about the monarchy becoming more diverse and modern.Amen to that. But poor old podgy Thomas, an awkward-looking white bloke, has been shunned from his daughter’s nuptials. You can’t blame him for speaking out.The royal courtiers enjoy the adulation the monarchy receives because Prince Harry has been “brave” enough to marry a woman with a complicated background.But the Palace spin machine freaks out when it comes to confronting the reality of Meghan’s parentage.Perhaps they just find it too vulgar.Harry’s PR man is Jason Knauf, an American specialist in “crisis management” having worked for Royal Bank of Scotland. He excels at sending angry letters to journalists he feels have gone too far snooping into Harry and Meghan’s private lives.But he doesn’t seem to have a clue as to how to handle his clients’ grumpy relatives.As a result, the monarchy is facing arguably its worst crisis since the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.We are often told how brilliant the Royal Family’s PR is. Part of the new royal spin, in fact, is about how great the royals now are at spin. They have “rebranded” the monarchy for the 21st century, and so on.Look at the blizzard of positive guff accompanying Prince William, Kate, and Harry’s campaign for mental illness last year.They were, it was said, making the younger Windsors seem more touchy-feely.At the moment, however, they don’t seem sensitive enough to speak to Meghan’s suffering in-laws.That’s not what you’d call a good look.The truth is, royal press officers have long got too much credit.The British admire the Queen because she is admirable.Overall, we prefer monarchy to any other system of government. That’s just common sense. It’s nothing to do with any ingenious branding and media strategy.The public also feels that the younger royals deserve a chance.At a time when our country is consumed by Brexit and political arguments, the wedding of Harry and Meghan came as a blessed relief — something we could all celebrate.The couple both came from broken homes, and nobody cared so long as they were happy. That’s all great.   But it’s obvious that Meghan has, as one royal expert put it, “background baggage that needs unpacking”.Insiders now say the treatment of the Markle family has been a “shambles”.This is before we consider the potential PR bombshells that could erupt if and when Meghan’s ex-husband, Trevor Engelson, decides to grant some interviews.The British don’t want to see the monarchy turned into a reality TV soap, as the Markles and Windsors wage a media war with each other.It’s trashy and embarrassing.But unless the Palace can tackle Meghan’s disgruntled kin, that’s exactly what is happening.Maybe we need a changing of the royal PR guard — before it’s too late.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yesterdays employment figures revealed that the proportion of young people unemployed (and not in full-time education) is now at a record low of 4.7% for our country - and far lower than for many other developed countries.It sends a significant message out about the drive and innovation of our young people, and the opportunities that our economy offers to them and their future.With our welfare changes this country can now be powered forward by this young generation.Since 2010, youth unemployment has fallen by over 45%, giving 130,000 more young people a job, and a future.Add the fact that wages are on the up and there are more than 829,000 vacancies nationwide, it’s clear that young people are entering the best jobs market in a decade.On average, the number of vacancies has increased by 4,280 each month over the last year, and those vacancies span from construction to technology.So when young people this week are deciding on their next steps, they can think big as there are plenty of opportunities out there for them, from a job with career progression, to taking up an apprenticeship.Look at Daisy, who turned down five university offers to work at global engineering firm JCB designing new equipment, and she didn’t have to go to university to get there.I’m forever being told, and intrinsically understand, that people want to study at different times in their lives, often inspired to do so when they see the practical benefits of their studies.That’s why so many people prefer, and do better, getting a job first and then studying for exams while they work.Even over the last few decades, how the world of education and work are linked has shifted dramatically. People no longer have one job for life, and lifelong learning is becoming more and more commonplace as people dip in and out of education.Many more people up-skill and retrain throughout their career – and this is how the future jobs market will remain vibrant and strong.And when I speak to employers up and down the country, from manufacturers to marketers, what they want are young people with the right attitude, prepared to work and learn. As they say, ‘if you’ve the will, we can give you the skill’.So when young people this week are deciding their next steps, the academic route isn’t the only option.You can now become a solicitor, an accountant or even a nuclear engineer through the apprenticeship route, earning as you learn and without the cost of going to University. Studying a Higher Apprenticeship gives an average wage boost of £150,000 over a working life.When I speak to young people around the country, I’m impressed with the confidence and self-assuredness with which they look to the future, and the range of options they consider beyond traditional routes.Im certainly no job snob. Life teaches you its not where you come from, its where you get to, and work is exactly the same.You can start anywhere and get to the top as Im repeatedly being told by our countrys top entrepreneurs.Top performers in their fields such as Debbie Moore, Jean-Christophe Novelli, Deborah Meaden and Jo Malone, did not go to university and are just a handful of the individuals who show that with drive and determination you can succeed by treading your own path.Its all about getting a break and taking the opportunities that come your way.So best of luck to everyone today, but whatever your results, there are many opportunities and pathways into a successful career.    Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have debt distress.”Pohiva said with China debt becoming so prolific, it was no longer a problem to be dealt with individually. He added: “I think these small countries will eventually come together to find a way out.”China defended its lending practices, saying they were sincere and unselfish, and insisting it only lent to countries that could repay.Tonga is one among a list of South Pacific countries that have taken on debt in recent years.Sydney’s Lowy Institute think tank, which has closely monitored China’s activities in the Pacific, estimates Beijing has poured nearly £1.4billion into Pacific countries since 2006.Other big debtors include Papua New Guinea, which owes roughly £498million in development and aid debt, Fiji, which owes £496million, and Samoa, with debt of £181million."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000427174175-e1534501297204.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"chapel remote cornish coast transformed","story":"Aphrodite was a Methodist chapel until it was bought five years ago, and the luxury renovated property can now be rented for up to £2,450 a week.The owners have given it a makeover with a nod to its ecclesiastical past, with upcycled church pews and a lectern complimenting the arched and stained glass windows.As well as having stylish interiors, the quirky holiday home is placed between the historic village of Tintagel and the picturesque fishing port of Boscastle.The property was originally built as two cottages as part of the Trevalga Estate, a 1,200-acre estate that includes the walled village.The estate was left in a trust to Marlborough College in Wiltshire by the last private owner, Gerald Curgenven, after his death in 1959.The two cottages were replaced with the chapel about 100 years ago.The current owners bought the property in 2013, carrying out a four-month renovation to create an angelic style.It is now a tranquil haven, laid out over five floors, with a master bedroom with a king-size bed, a bath tub hidden under a stone archway, a monsoon shower wet room, a cosy living room with woodburner and a modern kitchen/dining area.There is also a summer house across the lane from the cottage where guests can watch magnificent sunsets over the Atlantic.The South West Coast Path is just minutes away from the property, with Boscastle a two-mile walk.Guests can trek through the ancient woodlands of St Nectans Glen or continue along the cliffs to descend a steep track through the Vale of Avalon to Tintagel Castle and Merlins cave.A spokesman for Unique Home Stays, who rent out the property, said: The features the owners love are the arched window looking out to sea, the attention to detail in every nook and cranny, the flagstone floors, round woodburner and carved stonework.In just about every room there is an arched window with sea views and the quirky garden has secret hideaway corners and again has stunning sea views.Aphrodite is really very special and definitely has the wow factor."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000427153572.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"dr pimple popper removes tail from woman","story":"Taylor, 22, has had the lump, named “Lizzie the Lipoma” in between her bum cheeks since she was born but over time it grew bigger.A doctor removed the lump in 2016 but it eventually grew back.Desperate to remove the fatty deposit, which had destroyed her self-confidence, Taylor turned to Dr Pimple Popper.In the last episode of her new TV show Dr Sandra Lee sets to work trying to remove Taylor’s tail.She initially refused to operate due to how close the lipoma is to Taylor’s spinal cord – Dr Pimple Popper worried she could cause permanent nerve damage.“Theres two warning bells,” she said.“One is, why did this doctor remove this and then it came right back?“And then the other big thing for me is, a regular lipoma does not appear at birth.“You get that over time. There could be something else going on.”Dr Lee ordered an MRI scan, which shows there is a deposit of fat inside Taylors spinal cord.She offered to remove some of the bump to make it more aesthetically pleasing, but warned the procedure could disrupt Taylors spinal cord.“Even tugging on this lipoma in any way could potentially disrupt the growth within the spinal cord, and I dont want to do that in any way,” Dr Pimple Popper added.“By staying as superficial as possible Im able to shape this well and make sure it looks good without really disrupting it.”When the removal is complete, Dr Lee sews Taylor up with two to three times the normal amount of stitches to make sure the incision heals correctly.Afterwards Taylor revealed she has decided to see a neurosurgeon to see if its possible for her lipoma to be completely removed.“Im ecstatic about my results. Since my surgery with Dr Lee I feel more confident,” she said.“When I lost a part of Lizzie, there was a lot lifted off my shoulders.”A lipoma is a benign, fatty lump that grows under the skin.Theyre harmless and can usually be left alone if theyre small and painless.They are non-cancerous and are caused by an overgrowth of fat cells.Lipomas can grow anywhere on the body, but are most common on the shoulders, neck, chest, arms, back, bum and thighs.They grow very slowly and dont usually cause any problems.Lipomas dont usually need to be removed unless theyre causing problems, such as pain, or if theres uncertainty about whether its a lipoma.However it can be removed if it is large or is in an obvious place and is affecting your self-esteem.You should always see your GP if you develop a growth or swelling on your body."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT0004272119791.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk weather 23 degrees sun storm ernesto coming","story":"Much of the UK is enjoying warm, sunny weather for the first time in days today, with beaches along the south coast busy again.Sun-worshippers should make the most of it as tropical Storm Ernesto is spinning across the Atlantic towards the UK, bringing 45mph winds and heavy rain.Parts of the North of England, Wales, southern Scotland and Northern Ireland have already been suffering downpours today - but worse is set to come on Saturday night and into Sunday.Met Office forecaster Becky Mitchell told The Sun Online: Its going to be quite wet across northern and western areas today, with the highest amount of rain being 40mm (1.5ins) in Cumbria.Theres also going to be strong wind, particularly over high areas like the Pennines, with the strongest gusts being up to 40mph.But further south and east, its going to be drier with some bright spells.

Well, you must have been getting your news from the BBC, then.This was the latest example of Corbyn simpering around terrorists. Honouring scumbags who massacred 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich.The Black September gangsters castrated their male victims while they were still alive.But then, Corbyn was happy to attend the funerals of dead IRA terrorists. That’s the kind of chap he is. Actually, I say that was the “latest” case of Corbyn simpering around terrorists.Not quite. A day or two later a photo emerged of him giving the salute of the Muslim Brotherhood, a foul organisation proscribed as terrorists in six countries.And it’s all part of the anti-Semitism scandal which is tearing the Labour Party apart. An important story.Good people have left Labour as a consequence. The Jewish community in the UK is in uproar.Frightened of the far Left’s support for vile Islamists and its loathing of Israel and its right to exist.Scared of the morons who now lead Labour and its retinue of lefties who have said the most appalling, racist, stuff about Jews.Jeremy Corbyn, a genuine halfwit, thinks it is all “fake news”.He rolls his eyes when asked about it and gives different answers every time he is questioned.And guess who agrees with him? Yep, the BBC.The corporation refused to touch the story for a whole day, when it was first reported by blogger Guido Fawkes. Ignored it.Everyone else — including the left-wing  — thought it important.Instead, the front page of the BBC’s online news carried no fewer than SIX stories about former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and the allegations of Islamophobia made against him. Six!Boris had likened women who wear the burka to letter boxes or bank robbers.The vast majority of the country agreed that he wasn’t being racist. The vast majority want the burka banned here — as it is in Denmark, France, parts of Germany, Belgium and . . . Morocco.His comments were not much of a story at all. And the moves to sanction him solely a case of his enemies in the Conservative Party gleefully hammering the bloke.But the BBC became obsessed by it. It is always obsessed when the word Islamophobia is mentioned.And it loves to stick the boot into the Tories. Yet was utterly silent on the latest example of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party.It took them a full day to even mention the story.It’s another shocking case of the BBC’s bias. A left-liberal prejudice which runs right through the corporation from top to bottom.The same prejudice you hear whenever it deals with immigration (bloody marvellous!) or Brexit (absolutely ghastly!).Haven’t we had enough of this? Enough of paying £150.50 every year to have these credulous dupes pipe liberal propaganda into our homes every day.Get rid of the licence fee. Let the BBC survive through the subscriptions of those who are willing to pay. And on that deal, I’m out, Evan.Heres a photo of Rhian Sugden dressed as a plum.I’ve included it this week so that Tess Daly can enjoy it.Her husband, the uniquely interesting Vernon Kay, had a long sexting relationship with Rhian, apparently.And Tess was a bit hacked off.So maybe this will cheer her up.I’m on a diet. One of those low-carb things. God it’s boring.My favourite kinds of food are fat and carbohydrates, preferably mixed together.At night I dream of mashed potato and steak and kidney pudding.How can people enjoy life on a diet of bloody stir-fry?And the worst thing is it doesn’t seem to have done much for my weight. I still look like a pregnant middle-aged lesbian in a Boris Johnson wig.If the pounds don’t fall off soon I’m going to give it up.

The hotel she was staying in was “full of Spaniards”. Well, fair enough. They can be annoying. They get over-excited and spoil everyone’s fun.Where was Freda on holiday? Spain. Freda thinks she should have been warned about the possibility of being surrounded by Spaniards in Spain.She added that they should go “somewhere else” for their holidays.Brits are flooding to Turkey to take advantage of the crashing lira. You can get a holiday for two-fifths of nowt, apparently.All well and good.

A key committee has said that relaxing laws that stop people from vaping in offices and on trains could reduce deaths from smoking. The report by the Science and Technology Committee (STC) argues that vaping is less harmful than smoking cigarettes and that they should not be treated the same. They have called for an urgent review to make it easier for e-cigarettes to be made available on prescription, wider debate on vaping in public spaces, and greater freedom for the industry to advertise the devices as a less harmful option for smokers. But some public health experts have challenged the claims with one saying the report relies solely on accounts by e-cig champions. The report\u0027s release comes days after scientists warned that the perception that e-cigarettes are safe should be treated with caution.  Research led by the University of Birmingham found the vapourised e-liquid fluid in e-cigarettes has a similar effect on the lungs and body that is seen in regular cigarette smokers and patients with chronic lung disease. The Government has said it will carefully consider the evidence and recommendations made by the STC. Norman Lamb, the committee\u0027s chairman, told the : “The blunt fact is that 79,000 people in England still die of smoking every year, which is sort of unconscionable, particularly when we know there is the means by which we can reduce the death toll. He said that current policy and regulations do not sufficiently reflect the lesser harm posed by e-cigarettes than their conventional alternatives. Businesses, transport providers and public places should stop viewing conventional and e-cigarettes as one and the same, he said. There is no public health rationale for doing so. Concerns that e-cigarettes could be a gateway to conventional smoking, including for young non-smokers, have not materialised. If used correctly, e-cigarettes could be a key weapon in the NHS stop-smoking arsenal.  Public Health England (PHE) has estimated that e-cigarettes are at least 95% less harmful than smoking.  While uncertainties remain about the long-term health impact of the devices, they present an opportunity to significantly accelerate already declining smoking rates, the committee of MPs said. Mr Lamb said: Medically licensed e-cigarettes would make it easier for doctors to discuss and recommend them as a stop smoking tool to aid those quitting smoking. The approval systems for prescribing these products must be urgently reviewed. The report also called for limits on refill strengths and tank sizes, which may put off heavy smokers looking for a strong nicotine hit, to be reviewed. Meanwhile, NHS England\u0027s default policy should be that e-cigarettes are permitted on mental health units, to address the stubbornly high levels of smoking among people with mental health conditions, the report said. Around 2.9 million people in the UK are currently using e-cigarettes, with an estimated 470,000 using them as an aid to stop smoking, according to the report. Duncan Selbie, chief executive of PHE, said: E-cigarettes are not without harm but are way safer than the harms of tobacco. This is about comparing e-cigarettes to normal cigarettes, not fresh air. The UK leads the world in harm reduction from tobacco and there is no evidence that they are acting as a gateway into smoking for young people. Alison Cook, director of policy at the British Lung Foundation (BLF), said the report provides clarity on the potential of the devices.  The choice to switch to e-cigarettes must be made easier, she added. The report comes days after a Professor David Thickett, of the University of Birmingham\u0027s Institute of Inflammation and Ageing, warned the public must be aware that these devices are not harmless. He led a study published in the journal Thorax on Tuesday that e-cigarette vapour boosts the production of inflammatory chemicals and disables key protective cells in the lungs. He said: It has been suggested electronic cigarettes are safer than traditional cigarettes, and this narrative is increasingly supported by tobacco companies that have established research institutes devoted to generating supportive data. Reacting to the STC\u0027s report Simon Capewell, Professor in Public Health and Policy from Liverpool University, told the Daily Mail: The committee has concentrated solely on experts who are e-cig champions. More balanced reviews of the evidence by the World Health Organisation, (US) Food and Drug Administration have concluded that e-cigs are no better for quitting smoking than things like nicotine gum, patches or tablets. E-cigs in teens are a gateway to subsequent smoking lit cigarettes and e-cig vapour contains a large number of toxins which in time will obviously harm users, and bystanders. The STC\u0027s report also said an end to the ban on snus, an oral tobacco product which is illegal in the UK under EU regulations, should be considered after Brexit.

Robert Johnston successfully took a road resurfacing contractor to the small claims court after the firm refused to reimburse him for the damage. Mr Johnston\u0027s A6 was parked outside his business in Silverdale Road, Newcastle , last September when it was chipped by loose stones following the surface dressing of the road, the Stoke Sentinel reports. The 42-year-old repeatedly contacted both Staffordshire County Council, which is responsible for the road, and the firm contracted to carry out the work, Knutsford-based Road Management Services (RMS), with his concerns about the standard and safety of the surface.  RMS eventually wrote to Mr Johnston to say it had inspected the site and found \u0027no signs of loose aggregate\u0027 - and would therefore not offer him any compensation. Mr Johnston then launched a legal battle and, following a hearing at Stoke-on-Trent County Court, a judge ordered RMS to pay him \u0026pound4,211.20 in compensation, plus \u0026pound745 to cover his legal costs. The businessman, who owns Silverdale Motors, said: The court case was a dark cloud hanging over me. I was representing myself and it was quite a daunting experience. When the judge ruled in my favour I was really happy. It has been 10 months of hard work but it paid off. When you are right, you\u0027re right. The company has been negligent. Despite winning his legal battle, Mr Johnston remains concerned about the state of Silverdale Road.  The county council said if work on the road network was not up to standard, the contractor would have to remedy this at their own expense. Helen Fisher, cabinet member for Highways and Transport, said: “We have more than 6,000km of roads and the surface dressing programme plays a key role in reducing the risk of potholes.

But I\u0027m not going to tell you about Aretha Franklin\u0027s failings. They don\u0027t matter to a single one of us, and they don\u0027t matter any more to those closest to her. Aretha reached. That\u0027s the only word I can find to describe how her life panned out, what she achieved and what she meant. She lost her mother at 10, was pregnant by a school friend at 11, a mother at 12 and again at 15, daughter to a perverted superstar preacher who ran drug-and-sex orgies, and wife to a pimp who beat her. Singer Sam Cooke, a friend of her father\u0027s, is thought to have had sex with a 12-year-old Aretha when he was 23. Etta James, who died six years ago, was in the same congregation and said: I can understand Aretha not wanting to talk about that . . . Who wants to admit that you’re praising the Lord at the 8 p.m. service and servicing some drop-dead gorgeous hunk of a singer an hour later? Today, it\u0027s called child abuse. It\u0027s abandonment, vulnerable girls, predatory men, the most troubled and turbulent background it\u0027s possible to imagine. Yet through it Aretha reached - in the period after her mother died, she learned to play the piano by ear.  She went on the gospel circuit with her father, had her first two children and signed her first record deal. She almost signed to Tamla\u0027s motown label, which worked wonders for Diana Ross but would have buried Aretha\u0027s talent. She did better at Columbia, but in 1966 signed to the soul label Atlantic and hit the heights.  In February 1967 she released first single I Never Loved A Man. The B-side was Do Right Woman, Do Right Man. The B-side. In April she released her version of Otis Redding\u0027s Respect and in the space of just 3 months she was a megastar.  She did all that by the time she was 25, and with two children. She did it with a crappy childhood, sexual exploitation, and at a time when women and black women in particular were segregated, sidelined, and dehumanised. She did it because she reached back into her life, found the love and the pain, and hauled it up like Jonah wrestling his whale. Listen to her quiet, sad, dignified request for men to treat her kindly, and ask yourself who else could perform the same feat.  Aretha became a star for the same reason as Elvis Presley - she reached across the race divide. But while Elvis made black music acceptable by being a sexy white boy, Aretha showed that black and white both hurt the same. There\u0027s not a woman on the planet who doesn\u0027t want a Do Right Man, and after listening to that song, no man who doesn\u0027t want to do better. She sold 75million records to people who were not born in a wooden shack, weren\u0027t raised by perverts, had no interest in Baptist gospel and who nevertheless felt at one with her. When I was a teenager, she whispered in my ear about unrequited love. When I was a woman, she and I belted out songs about freedom and joy. When I fell in love we sang of our sweet, sweet baby, and when I was heartbroken, she raged with me about The House That Jack Built. And she winked at me and nodded when I changed our lyrics to demand he never came back. She was us. They were all our songs. And if she reached through it all, then we knew we could find the strength to do the same.  There is a moment in every one of her songs where you think she\u0027s given it all she can. Then she takes a breath, reaches, and finds some more. I don\u0027t know whether it\u0027s her diaphragm, her voice, or just plain magic but it elevates whoever hears it. Douglas Adams described Mark Knopfler as a man capable of making his guitar hoot and sing like angels on a Saturday night said there was a moment in every Dire Straits song where it is possible to fly. Well, Aretha sings like the angels\u0027 jaded, yet hopeful barmaid, and there is a point in every song where she lifts the weight of the world from everyone\u0027s shoulders. Her loved ones said she never sought help for her demons, never truly dealt with her drinking, gorging, and trips to mental clinics. Instead she went on stage. Perhaps if she had the help she deserved she would not have helped the rest of us realise we were not alone. She kept back the careers of her sisters, raged at friends, threw strops that would have embarrassed Henry VIII, but I don\u0027t care that she must have been hell to live with. With her, the rest of us had heaven on Earth.  She played piano like it was a percussion instrument. She arranged many of her own songs, and had the same natural talent for music that the rest of us do for breathing. But there\u0027s one story that tells you more about her than anything else.  In 1998 she was at the Grammys to perform her Blues Brothers version of Think, with John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. Her friend Luciano Pavarotti was due to perform Nessun Dorma, and despite rehearsing it perfectly he called in 30 minutes after the show began to say he had a cold and could no longer sing.  Aretha was asked to fill the gap, perhaps do one of her signature tracks. She asked instead to hear Pavarotti\u0027s rehearsal. Producer Ken Ehrlich said: In those days we had a boombox with a cassette. And I brought it to her and played it for her. When she heard it, she said, ‘Yeah, I can do this\u0027. She went out on stage, for a live, worldwide broadcast, with an orchestra she\u0027d not practised with, a choir she didn\u0027t know and a nervous conductor, and sang, in Italian, one of the most iconic and powerful songs in the world. One minute in, she reaches. Then reaches again, and again, and you\u0027re wowed, and somehow she reaches twice more and hits the final high note. Those final words, translated, are: At dawn, I will win. I will win, I will win!  At 16 Aretha had toured with Martin Luther King, and 10 years later sang at his funeral. She was rightly honoured and lauded throughout her later life, in 1987 she became the first woman inducted into the Rock\u0027n\u0027Roll Hall of Fame, and she even had an asteroid named after her. She\u0027s been called the greatest singer of all time, the voice of the civil rights movement, and much else besides. She was a spendthrift, a diva, and had a mink coat that she loved so much it used to have its own seat. Through it all, she remained an insecure little girl who thought she wasn\u0027t good enough. Still she reached for something more. More food, more drink, more men, more, more, more than this. And that\u0027s where her magic lay - the ability to show hope amid pain, to see potential in a poverty of experience. That is, after all, the thing that makes us human. We can rise, and when her voice soars it makes you feel that you have, and you can. If that\u0027s not soul, I don\u0027t know what is. In 2015 at a ceremony honouring songwriter Carol King, Aretha performed Natural Woman. She thumped those piano keys like they were in trouble, her voice hit the song at full speed, and Barack Obama wept 20 seconds after she\u0027d opened her mouth. Halfway through, she stands up and reaches for a high note as the auditorium gives her a standing ovation. She throws that mink coat to the floor, and finds more. She goes on, and up, and up, and there\u0027s nothing the audience can do but clap harder. She was a natural woman. She made us feel what it was like to be her, and to be us, and to be human. She showed us what soul was, and she\u0027ll never stop because that voice will never be silent. My daughter will grow up with Aretha in her ears, feeling that they two alone share a secret. You make us feel, Aretha. You always will.

The Bradley Foundation was set up to continue the legacy of the Sunderland superfan who lost his fight against neuroblastoma last year at the age of six.  In a passionate Facebook post on Thursday afternoon, the charity defended itself against social media claims relating to the misuse of funds raised in Bradley’s name, reports Chronicle Live .  One highlighted comment suggested the Lowery family were enjoying a “luxury lifestyle” and suggested “the truth will be out soon”.  Bradley\u0027s mum Gemma hit back at the accusations and said all the money raised in her son\u0027s name was given to the foundation. She said: “We have had a few people writing silly comments saying the charity money is not going to the charity. “Anybody in their right mind knows every penny donated to charity stays with the charity. Everything that was raised for Bradley, we donated it all. “I don’t think they realise everything that goes on behind the scenes. People don’t know we’re sometimes up till midnight messaging parents about treatment options. “It’s a shame we have to justify ourselves when we are working 16-17 hour days.”  The Foundation’s lengthy response also revealed the charity is in the process of its annual audit and the results will be published online. Gemma, from Blackhall Colliery, added: “We are getting punished because we have not published everything we do with the money. “They will be free for every single person to look at.” Lynn Murphy, head of communications and fundraising with the Foundation, confirmed the charity will not have a definitive figure on the money raised until the annual audit is completed.  The accounts will show funds was spent on four rounds of last-ditch rounds of immunotherapy treatment for Bradley in the last months of his life. Lynn said the Foundation received numerous trolling messages, but the accusation of a “luxury lifestyle” prompted the charity to respond. She added: “Cremating a child is not a life of luxury, it’s a life of torment and grief. Gemma’s emotional state at this time is not great - she should not have to put up with these messages. “We have had messages from every single one of the families we have worked with saying how sorry we are we have to go through this. “We thank everyone in the local community for their support. These comments are few and far between.

But public loos are being wiped out at a staggering rate as councils struggle with government budget cuts. More than a QUARTER of public toilets have disappeared since the turn of the century, according to data obtained under Freedom of Information laws. According to the new information - supplied by council areas across the UK - the total number of public toilets across the country has dropped from 3,084 in 2000 to 2,290 in 2018. That is a fall of nearly 800. And authorities in Bolsover, North East Derbyshire, and Wokingham admitted they no longer had ANY council-run loos. In London, of the councils that provided information, the number of public loos was down from 197 in 2000 to just 132 today. The rest of England saw a fall from 2,400 to 1,534, while in Wales numbers had more than halved from 504 to 243. Scotland was down from 759 to 421 while Northern Ireland dropped from 95 to 84.  Campaigners say the problem leaves people with nowhere to go when they need to go and it is affecting everyone from outdoor workers such as builders as well as pregnant women and parents with children. Toilets that can be easily found and used are essential for the elderly and disabled. And with one in five people above 40 suffering from an over-active bladder, the lack of public facilities can make some reluctant to leave their homes due to the risk of being caught short. It is not a legal requirement to provide public lavatories and so when councils aren\u0027t feeling flush, toilet blocks are often targeted first when it comes to cuts. A typical toilet block is estimated to cost between \u0026pound12,000 to \u0026pound15,000 a year to maintain. But Domestos believes that clean, safe toilets should be within everyone’s reach. That is why it is launching the nationwide Use Our Loos initiative to tackle the demise and unlock loos in local coffee shops, cafes, restaurants and bars across Britain’s towns, cities and villages.  The scheme is urging local shops and businesses to sign up, throw open their cubicles and make their toilets available to non-customers. As part of the initiative, Domestos is also partnering with The Great British Public Toilet Map – an interactive street map that shows users where their nearest public toilet is and which businesses have signed up to the scheme. The map will be regularly updated as new businesses join. Domestos also plays a role in the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan’s aim to get 25 million people across the world access to a clean and safe toilet by 2020. Domestos has partnered with Unicef, the world’s leading children’s organisa\u0026shytion, since 2012 and has already helped 10 million people around the world get cleaner, safer toilets.  Raymond Martin of the British Toilet Association which campaigns for better public facilities, has praised the initiative, saying it will increase visitors to Britain’s high streets. He says : “As human beings we all have to eat, drink, sleep, breathe and go to the toilet,” he said. “Having access to a clean hygienic toilet is absolutely vital for our everyday life and activity. Rebecca Light, Domestos Senior Brand Manager, says: “In the UK the problem is locating a public toilet. An estimated 2.3 billion people worldwide lack access to clean, safe sanitation. This comes with significant health risks, including diarrhoea, which kills one child every two minutes. It’s vital we change this – and quickly.” "},{"url":null,"title":"horrified dad pulls metal coil","story":"NewsHorrified dad pulls METAL COIL from three-year-old son\u0027s throat - after he chokes on crispsEXCLUSIVE Preston Green was eating cheese and onion Wheat Crunchies when he approached his parents Adam and Chelsea, from Market Harborough in Leicesterhsire, complaining something was trapped in his throatShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByAbigail O\u0027Leary21:02, 16 AUG 2018Updated21:03, 16 AUG 2018NewsPreston approached his parents gagging on the spring which was stuck in his throat (Image: Adam Green)Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA horrified dad pulled a two-inch METAL COIL from his three-year-old son\u0027s throat after he began choking on crisps.

In a desperate rush to save his son’s life, panic-stricken Adam, 26, smacked Preston on the back before a silver object, around two inches long, shot out of his mouth. Adam and 24-year-old Chelsea were horrified when they realised their son had been choking on a spring - which they claim came from the crisp packet.  Describing the horrific ordeal which occurred at their family home on Wednesday, Adam told the : We always buy the Wheat Crunchies because they are the boys’ favourite crisps. “We’d bought a multi-pack from Home Bargains in Kettering and Preston asked for a packet so I grabbed a bag to give to him. “Minutes after he started eating them, he runs up to us and starts complaining something was in his throat - he was gagging and choking.” The horrified parents, who also have son Leyton, aged five, reacted instantly, realising something was trapped Preston\u0027s airway.  Adam added: “I smacked him on the back and got it out. It was part of a crisp, but wrapped around it was this spring. “It was the size of the Wheat Crunchie - about two inches long I would say.” Adam said Preston went on to complain of pain in his teeth after the traumatic ordeal, likely caused by the spring which he had unknowingly bitten down on. The dad added: It was frightening, but thankfully nothing really serious happened, and Preston is OK, apart from complaining about pain in his teeth. Adam took pictures of the spring and contacted manufacturer KP Snacks, revealing how they had gone through one of every parent\u0027s worst nightmares - witnessing their child choking on a piece of food.

But one person that she may be compared to more often than not is her husband\u0027s late mum, Princess Diana .   The people\u0027s princess remains a firm favourite with fans of the royal family and it is wonderful to see sweet similarities between the two.  Most recently it\u0027s come to light that the pair have shared the same thoughtful hobby.   In a post on her old lifestyle blog, The Tig , Meghan went into detail about her love of throwback things - especially the practice of handwriting letters, something Diana also took the time to do.   The former Suits star wrote: Amongst the throwback things that I love (a ’62 porsche speedster \u0026agrave la Dylan McKay in 90210, a bevy of Vargas girls, a Busby Berkeley film, or cooking over a charcoal grill), what trumps all is my love of writing (and receiving) a handwritten note.  She adds that she absolutely adores getting mail. I absolutely relish it. I know my mailman\u0027s name, I race to the door when the mail comes (usually just fliers or bills), but I always hold out hope there will be a letter. A sweet letter. And that I will have the tactile experience of un-creasing the paper, reciting the words, and holding someone\u0027s thoughts in my hands.   And according to author Andrew Morton , who wrote an authorised biography for Diana, Meghan\u0027s late mother-in-law also got a kick out of handwritten letters and was determined to send thank-you cards to as many people as possible.   He notes in particular, that after her grand wedding to Prince Charles in 1981, Diana sat down to answer many of the 47,000 letters of congratulation and 10,000 gifts which the wedding generated.  Though she did have the help of staff to complete this gigantic task. Personal letters from the princess are considered extremely valuable today, with some selling at auctions for thousands of pounds.

Timothy Philpott stabbed her several times in the chest and her life was only saved by concerned neighbours who heard her screams and knocked on the door of the home in Cannock, Staffordshire. The victim told police how she had argued with Philpott, 29, in the early hours of February 19 after he accused her of having an affair. The Express and Star report that Philpott was paranoid his partner was seeing someone who lived across the road. At first the thug had punched and kicked his partner and when she told him he would not be able to see his children he replied: I may as well kill you. I\u0027ll stab you, and fetched a carving knife from the kitchen.   A neighbour told Stafford Crown Court they’d heard the victim shout shortly before 2am: “Help me, help me, he’s trying to kill me.”  With his savage attack stopped by the neighbours Philpott left the knife embedded in the victim\u0027s chest and fled the scene with police called. Officers entering the property found the victim, aged 26 at the time of the incident, on a sofa with a knife blade protruding from her chest. There was blood on the walls and all over her hair and body. They were shining a torch into a coal shed at the rear of a property nearby when they heard a sound in the garden.  They saw a man matching Philpott\u0027s description and shouted for him to get on the floor warning him they had a Taser. They handcuffed and arrested him. In a police interview Philpott told detectives he had argued with his partner and had only realised the extent of the assault when there was banging at the door and he ‘snapped out of his red mist.’ Philpott was sentenced to 12 years in jail with a further four years on licence. He pleaded guilty on May 22. The victim underwent emergency surgery at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, having the knife removed from her chest by surgeons. She is still receiving treatment for a hand injury as she severed tendons when she tried to take hold of the knife, Staffordshire Police said in a statement.

Instead of shaking hands, Farah had greeted the man by placing a hand over her heart which is a common custom in the Muslim community. However, Farah claims that as soon as this happened she was told to leave the office in Stockholm and her interview was over.  Speaking to SVT, Farah said: As soon as I got into the lift I started crying. It had never happened to me before - it didn\u0027t feel good at all. It was awful. Farah lodged a case with the discrimination ombudsman in Sweden who took the company to court. She won the case and was awarded \u0026pound3,420 in compensation.

Brian Lord OBE says a successful attack on its infrastructure could cause “unprecedented damage” and “unrest across the world”. With a complex ecosystem of computation, networking, and physical operational processes spread around the world the industry has a large attack surface with many attack vectors. A typical large oil and gas company uses half a million processors just for oil and gas reservoir simulation and stores petabytes of sensitive and competitive field data as well as sharing and drilling and production control systems across geographies, fields, vendors, service providers, and partners.  The topic will be high on the agenda for industry leaders at this year’s ADIPEC conference in Abu Dhabi. Lord says: “The oil and gas industry is the second most susceptible to cyber-attacks, with the potential to cause unprecedented damage and unrest across the world. “The primary cyber threat to oil and gas infrastructure comes from hostile states who are developing disruptive capabilities in order to deliver power projection for their own long term geo-political and politico-military ends. “Such is the severity of a threat from a relatively small disruptive attack at the right part of an unprepared oil \u0026amp gas system, the issue will be a key topic at this year’s ADIPEC conference, the premier global energy forum for oil \u0026amp gas experts, where industry leaders will be sharing best practice and new developments in order to ensure they always remain one step ahead.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prince georges first day school","story":"NewsWhy Prince George\u0027s first day at school will be very different this yearPrince George will be starting his second year at Thomas\u0027s in Battersea next monthShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor14:00, 17 AUG 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay nowGet daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailParents across the country are making the most of their final few weeks of quality time with the kids before they go back to school, while also secretly counting down the days. Like lots of other little boys and girls, Prince George will be getting ready to start his second year at school in September.  The little royal, who is third in line to the throne, will be going into Year 1 at Thomas\u0027s Battersea, a \u0026pound17,604-a-year private school , in south west London.  But George will have a very different first day of term to last year.  Last year when he walked into the school George was met by a group of photographers ready to capture the important milestone. He looked very nervous as he walked through the playground, and was holding his dad\u0027s hand, before being greeted by the head of the Lower School, Helen Haslem. When Princes William and Harry started school they faced a huge group of photographers, but the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge only invited a few chosen members of the press to their son\u0027s special day. However this year it\u0027s unlikely any media will be invited to photograph him arriving for the start of term, as it\u0027s normally only done for a young royal\u0027s first day at a new school.  The royal family and the media have an agreement which allowed the royal royals to enjoy their education in private. And that won\u0027t be the only thing which could be different this year, and there\u0027s also a good chance Kate will drop George off at school for his first day this time. Last year, she was too unwell to take him as she was suffering from extreme morning sickness early on in her pregnancy with Prince Louis.

In the mornings it\u0027s the worst, like it hurts to breathe. My side hurts. My shoulder hurts. I can\u0027t even get up. Dramatic video footage captured Jordan falling dozens of feet from the bridge in Moulton Falls Regional Park, Yacolt, last Tuesday. The teenager could be seen standing nervously at the edge of the structure, before her pal, later identified as Taylor, pushed her from behind. Surrounded by friends, she was reportedly heard saying no twice, before plunging into the Lewis River. She landed with a \u0027belly flop\u0027.  Cops have investigated the incident and have passed the case to Clark County prosecutors, who are said to be considering charges. Taylor has reportedly been co-operating with investigators.  In an earlier text to NBC News, she said she had repeatedly apologised to Jordan and that she feels really bad about what happened.  She also said she had been receiving threats. However, in her latest interview, Jordan said her pal\u0027s apology doesn\u0027t help her \u0027madness\u0027 that she almost died and the rest of her summer is gone. The teenager had gone to the bridge with friends last week. It is thought she had initially wanted to jump off the bridge, but ended up getting scared because of its height and told her pals no.  However, before she could come down, she was shoved into the water.  In a previous interview with Mail Online , Jordan\u0027s aunt Kristie Morgan said her niece was suffering physically and emotionally, having left hospital.  She said she was struggling to breathe and experiencing panic attacks. But despite the pain, she claimed the teenager didn\u0027t want \u0027revenge\u0027. Speaking before Jordan\u0027s comments about jail, she said: Jordan is truly the sweetest girl in the world. She doesn\u0027t wish to seek revenge on her friend. But in my opinion her friend needs to learn a lesson.  Jordan sister, Vanessa, spoke to KOIN in Canada shortly after the incident.   I think she [the friend] tried to do it jokingly and didn\u0027t think what could have happened, Vanessa said. You don\u0027t really play around at 60 feet. The footage of the incident was posted on YouTube last week. As Jordan fell, her arms and legs could be seen flailing helplessly in the air. Ashley Mahree, who recorded the video and posted it on the site, wrote in the description: “This could have easily taken a life, and I think this girl needs to be held accountable in some way. She added: The person that pushed her should go to jail. Although a sign at the site prohibits jumping and diving into the water, the bridge is popular among adrenaline junkies.

The cringy moment happened on Sunday night\u0027s episode of The $100,000 Pyramid, an American quiz show broadcast on ABC. The premise of the show involves a contestant being paired with a well-known celebrity, who they have to offer clues to about certain topics.  And the more clues they guess correctly, the more money they win.  Contestant Evan Kaufman had been paired up with Saturday Night Live legend Timothy Meadows, who he sat across when he was given the topic of “people whose last name is Obama”. The dad could have listed the forenames of the former US president\u0027s family – Barack, Michelle, Malia and Sasha. However the pressure clearly got to Evan who after a long pause said: “Bin Laden”.  Humiliated Evan has since taken to Twitter after the video went viral, to reveal why he went for the alternative answer. He wrote: “The first square flips, I breathe. “I read ‘People Whose Last Name is Obama’. I freeze. “There\u0027s only one. BARACK OBAMA. “‘Who else is a famous Obama?’ My brain is racing.   Why Fortnite keeps crashing - and what you should do if the game goes down  “I need to list multiple people. I can\u0027t just say Barack. “What I should have said was, ‘Michelle, Sasha, Malia, Bo! The PORTUGUESE WATER DOG BO!’ “Here\u0027s what my brain decided. Who is associated with Obama? Who did he kill? What sounds like Obama! “And so you have this perfectly viral clip. A clip that is insanely funny.

Stefanie Boyce looked on with profound honour as her beautiful nine-year-old daughter, Brooklyn, took her final breath last week after battling a rare condition. Just eight months earlier, she had watched her 11-year-old son, Jayden - Brooklyn\u0027s beloved older brother - pass away peacefully as he lay between her and her husband. The siblings had both lived courageously with the same rare and terminal disorder. And as Brooklyn neared the end of her short life, Stefanie found herself asking an unimaginable question that no mum or dad should ever be faced with. What parent has to think these thoughts, \u0027I wonder if my daughter\u0027s death will be as beautiful as my son\u0027s?\u0027, said the 37-year-old writer, from Illinois, US.  Referring to Brooklyn as \u0027B\u0027 and Jayden as \u0027J\u0027, she added: My greatest fear was B’s passing would be sudden and tragic. A seizure. A morning I’d find her not breathing. Some way that I couldn’t say good-bye. Some way not as holy or sacred as Jayden’s. But since her daughter\u0027s death, Stefanie has experienced a form of peace, knowing her two brave children are together again, playing in Heaven. B is probably dragging him around Heaven giving him the tour even though J knows his way around, she said in an emotional tribute to the pair. And I bet J is chuckling and going along with it as she does. It was on Monday, August 6, that Brooklyn received her crown of life, surrounded by her loved ones, including her dad, Justin, 38, and six-year-old sister, Ellie.  Also known as Beeba, the youngster had a contagious laugh and lit up every room with her personality - which was as big as her beautiful blonde hair. The same day of the week, on November 13 last year, her brother and best pal Jayden had gained his own crown, while lying peacefully between their parents. A gentle little boy who had a vibrant smile for everyone, he had loved dancing with his mum, playing with his dad and holding hands with Brooklyn and Ellie. Brooklyn and Jayden had both been \u0027brave warriors\u0027 against Sanfilippo Syndrome, a regressive metabolic disorder that affects around one in 70,000 children. Youngsters with the condition progress for a couple of years, before slowly losing the ability to walk, talk and eat. They typically pass away before they reach 20.  In Stefanie\u0027s tribute, which she gave  permission to share, she described how her and husband Justin\u0027s routine has all disappeared in one breath. We are no longer a special needs family, said the mum, whose youngest, Ellie, does not have the genetic disease. Our membership to the club got revoked. Expired. And although we never wanted to join, once we did, we didn’t want to leave. Beauty is found in its members. God is found in its meetings. Don’t get me wrong, we will stay connected as honorary members, but honorary none the less. But she added that there’s a peace now that comes as I envision J and B together. Maybe they’re laughing together because B just had to pass on the 6 and J on the 13, so they could share the Monday, she said.  But in true Beeba fashion, her Monday would be first. She concluded: I always wondered why two, but not anymore. Although their lives were short, Brooklyn and Jayden both helped to raise awareness of Sanfilippo Syndrome and the desperate need to find a cure. An obituary for Brooklyn describes how the little girl navigated the condition with strength, grace, and a smile as genuine as they come. She did so while impacting the lives of others. On the day of her daughter\u0027s death, Stefanie said it was her profound honour to have watched the youngster take her first and her last breath. Mourning and sadness feel just as right as joy. Brooklyn, you have brought joy to our life and to every life that has ever been touched by yours, she said.  Even in your last few breaths you made me smile in my tears. May I always strive to live as beautifully as you have. She added that she would be forever looking for her sweet girl. The day after Brooklyn\u0027s passing, Stefanie and Justin marked their 14th wedding anniversary. They spent part of it at a funeral home, planning their daughter\u0027s funeral. Brooklyn\u0027s life will be celebrated at Immanuel Church in Gurnee later this month. Although she and Jayden had suffered from Sanfilippo, the syndrome was not all of them and they didn\u0027t allow it to stop them from smiling and having fun. Their parents say their legacies will last for an eternity.  Stefanie\u0027s full tribute Together. There’s a weird feeling I have that my grief feels complete. There had been an anticipation of having to do this again and fear of what it would be like. My greatest fear was B’s passing would be sudden and tragic. A seizure. A morning I’d find her not breathing. Some way that I couldn’t say good-bye. Some way not as holy or sacred as Jayden’s. What parent has to think these thoughts, “I wonder if my daughter’s death will be as beautiful as my son’s?” I do. But, I’m not the only one. There was an incompleteness to my grief. Maybe that sounds wrong but it isn’t meant to. I certainly would have chosen another day of anticipation if it meant I could have B. It’s just J and B were always, J\u0026ampB. A package deal. It was always hard to separate them, even google photo gets it wrong. Of course they were individuals, too. J was sweet, B was spicy. J was patient, B was ...me. J was a runner, B was a singer.

Members of the Satanic Temple brought the eight-and-a-half ft tall carving of Baphomet, an occult goat-man hybrid, to the grounds of the Arkansas State Capitol building in Little Rock yesterday. The winged monster sits on a throne emblazoned with a pentagram. Alongside a child gazes adoringly up at the man with the goat head. The striking statue was part of a rally outside the state\u0027s seat of government in protest at a Ten Commandments monument already installed in the grounds.  It has now been taken away but the Satanic Temple have filed a lawsuit to have its reinstated in the name of religious pluralism and the First Amendment, KATV news reports. The display prompted counter-protests from Christian activists. The Satanic Church, who have chapters across the globe that campaign for religious freedom, claim they wrote to state legislators in to ask the Baphomet statue be allowed. Speaking at the rally Lucien Greaves, spokesman and co-founder of the Satanic Temple said: “The event is intended to be an inclusive gathering where The Satanic Temple will be celebrating pluralism along with Christian and secular speakers. People of many faiths will come together at the Capitol to reject the Arkansas State Legislature\u0027s efforts to privilege one religion over others.

Esteysi \u0027Stacy\u0027 Sanchez, 31, hit the victim so hard his foot was severed and he ended up in the car with her after smashing through the windshield. Investigators and neighbours were equally horrified when they saw the wrecked car parked near her house, with the mutilated corpse still inside. Sanchez is reported to have drunk-driven the car home for more than a mile after the crash on Oceanside in San Diego. She then walked home and changed her clothes, according to evidence heard in court.  Fox 5 reports Sanchez, who sobbed in the dock as she was jailed for 15 years, had been out boozing all night and was heading home when she hit the man at roughly 6am. As her lawyer begged leniency the judge on Wednesday banged her up for 15 years to life in state prison. Sanchez was convicted in April of second-degree murder, gross vehicular manslaughter and hit-and-run in the death of 69- year-old Jack Tenhulzen, reported Fox 5.  Shortly before sentencing Tenhulzen\u0027s niece, Lisa Francisco, described her loving uncle and told Sanchez that she broke her heart. At one point, the hearing was interrupted because the defendant was close to collapse as she cried and eventually said: “I’m sorry.” Deputy District Attorney Robert Bruce, prosecuting, had told jurors Sanchez displayed a conscious disregard for human life when she drove drunk and ran over Tenhulzen on a pathway near the state Route 76 bridge the morning of June 27, 2016.  He said the victim went through the windshield and into the passenger seat of her car. The court was told part of one of his legs was severed in the accident and found at the back of the car near the rear window. Tenhulzen was hit so hard that he was ripped out of his trousers and shoes, authorities said.  The news station said it happened after a night of drinking when Sanchez left a hotel room the next morning and was told by a male friend that she was too drunk to drive, Mr Bruce told the jury. In turn, Defence attorney Herb Weston argued Sanchez was tired and fell asleep behind the wheel and rode up on the sidewalk, striking Tenhulzen.

While some of us will drop straight off, others use that quiet time before bed to wind down with a bit of reading or TV. But sometimes our other halves can ruin these peaceful moments with some very annoying habits.  A new survey by mattress company Leesa has revealed the things which irritate men and woman the most in the bedroom - and we\u0027re all probably guilty of some of them.   The top spot is actually the same for both genders, with everyone agreeing the most annoying thing is when your partner starts arguing with you in bed. As well as being REALLY annoying, there\u0027s lot of research which shows arguing before bed can actually make the row even worse - so it\u0027s better to avoid this at all costs. A partner stealing the covers is another big issue, but it seems women are more bothered by it than men.  Of the 983 people surveyed, 91 per cent of women said it really bothered them compared to 81 per cent of men. Talking on the phone is also a big cause of upset, with 80 per cent of women and 78 per cent of men saying it drives them mad.

One mum was hoping to create this special moment for her children by getting the family a sweet new pet. Amanda Johnson had been thinking about buying a hamster for a while, but on August 14 she finally took the plunge and headed to the pet shop. She selected the most active and fun fluffy hamster the store had, before heading home to surprise her family. But things didn\u0027t quite go to plan.  On the 35-minute drive home, Amanda felt something brush her leg. She chose to ignore it. Then it happened again and she caught a glimpse of the little hamster, sitting behind the clutch pedal. The fluffy pet had managed to get out of it\u0027s cage, which had been placed in the boot, and was now moving freely about the car! Amanda drove the rest of the way cautiously, unable to stop and search at the side of the road.  Once home she desperately looked for the family\u0027s new pet, to no avail.  In a post on Facebook, which has been shared over 5,000 times, she explained what happened next.  Get home, jumped out and had the last glimpse of the orange fur ball as it burrowed its way behind the pedals. All evening I checked the car every ten minutes trying to entice the thing out - nothing. Anyway, this morning I was first out the door to check of any sign and it’s eaten its way through the passenger seatbelt of my car.  I’ve been to four garages and they have told me the damage to foamy parts of the car including under the seats is extensive and it’s only been 24 hours! We have had no luck in finding it! This could only happen to me! Ask me how much I’m loving life right now!!!!!! Following this initial post, Amanda shared updates on the hilarious situation over the next few days. On day three of having the hamster, she took the car to the garage where mechanics informed her that the damage the pet was causing would result in hours and hours of labour and diagnostics.  She also discovered the passenger door airbag had been destroyed. A friend suggested she try vacuuming the car to lure the hamster out - or lay humane traps, so she headed to the hardware store to buy mouse traps. After four days, she added: This hamster is fast becoming my life! The little s*** has defied eight traps. He has also started nibbling the plastic around the seatbelt area. People on Facebook are loving the story.

Anchor Trish Regan took a shot at the Scandinavian country claiming that there\u0027s something rotten in Denmark and no one wants to work. But her anti-socialist diatribe was dismantled by a Danish politician who blasted her as fake news in this hilarious twitter clip.  Posting a clip of her comments on Twitter, Regan claimed:   Socialism NEVER works! Not in Venezuela, not in Cuba, and not even in DENMARK! These countries have stripped people of their opportunities.  The Dems need to rid their party of socialists for their own good - and the good of our nation.

Regan had bizarrely claimed that in Denmark, nobody graduates from school and all of those that do, just want to start cupcake caf\u0026eacutes. Not that there\u0027s anything wrong with cupcakes, but in other words, nobody is incentivised to do anything because they\u0027re not going to be rewarded.

The event, known as the El Pilon de Falces, which translates as the Falces Bull-running Festival, takes place every year in in the town of Falces in the northern Spanish region of Navarre. The run consists of 800 metres along a narrow track involving steep slopes. This year the bulls completed the run in just 58 seconds, but half way down one of the slopes, a bull fell into a group of young men causing several to be crushed.  Despite the dramatic footage there were only light injuries to eight men, although three were treated in hospital , one for bruising, another with a hip injury, and a third with an injured shoulder blade.

Little Yernar Alibekov, from the city of Astana in north-eastern Kazakhstan, was left like this after he was diagnosed with a rare connective tissue disorder known as Ehlers-Danlos syndromes one month after being born. The boys condition was so bad that it left his skin sagging and the first signs came right after he was born with saggy eyelids that left him scratching them all the time.  Just like in the Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Yernar was looking like an old man even as he learned how to walk.    The boy\u0027s mother, Zibensa Tulepbergenova, says that even though skin-lifting procedures are officially allowed only as of 18, the administration of the local hospital they came to for help decided to break the rules.  Even though the family could have waited some years to get a free surgery, they decided to spend 112,000 KZT (\u0026pound245) to improve the quality of life of their son. The money was raised by volunteers and friends, as this amount was too high for Yernars family alone.  Experts are skeptical that the surgery will significantly help in Yernars case. Doctor Olga Loseva said: This is a rare disease that happens to one in 50,000. The fact that the boy had surgery won\u0027t improve his skin condition if it is saggy it wont change. The only way out is to mitigate consequences of this disease and take great care of him.

We knew it would be a good game, we know what Hibs are about, they are a very good team.“I enjoyed the way we played, some of the stuff in the first half was excellent but we know they have quality and put us under pressure. I’m pleased we stuck to our guns and we got what we deserved.”There was plenty to be happy about including an impressive display from winger Cammy Dow.Jimmy said: “Sam Jackson did great, he’s a confident big boy and I thought Cammy Dow was excellent – he’s a massive Dundee fan as well, which is great.”The second-round draw is today at 1pm.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"csaba proud of his dundee united players for handling pressure at queen of the south","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United’s players might have been feeling the pressure according to boss Csaba Laszlo but he was proud they didn’t show it in their their 2-1 victory at Queen of the South.An impressive first-half display put the Tangerines in a winning position as Sam Stanton and debutant Pavol Safranko gave them a two-goal lead.The second period saw United have to defend their lead as the Doonhamers came at them with Stephen Dobbie knocking in after 67 minutes – Csaba’s men, though, held them at arms length for the rest of the contest and grabbed their first victory of the league season.The manager said: “I am proud of the boys because they did a good job.“We were under pressure because we knew against Dunfermline we lost an important game and now the second game of the season we had to perform and to win.“This was definitely a very good team performance and I am proud of the boys, they worked for each other.“We had a really bad start at home against Dunfermline and I think the players felt there was pressure.“We don’t want to disappoint our fans again and you saw there were a lot of our fans at the game and they celebrated also.“The fans made the noise against Dunfermline that it wasn’t good enough and we heard that.“I said after that Dundee United can play better football and our fans deserved more spirit, more fighting spirit and better results.“That pressure is always there if you have the jersey of Dundee United, if you are the manager of Dundee United, work for Dundee United you are the biggest club in the Championship and everybody wants to beat you.“People think it is easy to win a game, it is not easy – you have to respect the opponent, you have to know in this league it is not always nice football, it is more fighting and desire.“You could see Queen of the South didn’t give up, in the second half they put I don’t know how many balls up front.“I am really pleased with the first-half performance, I am a little bit angry we don’t close the game out but I’m happy with the three points and the performance from the team.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/SNS-15302518-DUFC-V-ST-J.jpg-503x564.jpg ","title":"dundee colts and united drawn at home in irn bru cup","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee Colts and Dundee United have been awarded home ties in the Irn Bru Cup.The second round draw has seen the Dark Blues youngsters host Motherwell Colts.Meanwhile United will welcome Alloa Athletic to Tannadice.

I just didn’t get my game-time.“When I did play at Dundee, I think I did well, but I thank Neil McCann for giving me the chance to come out to Dunfermline on loan.“The system we played at Dundee didn’t help me. We were playing just one up front and I was playing as a second striker and on the left and the right wing.“I was happy to play, I was happy to get a game but I don’t think it was my right position.“All my goals I scored with Dundee came when I was in my right position, in the middle, and I’m happy to get the chance to play there with Dunfermline.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b729b44b349c-463x564.jpg ","title":"new boy safranko hopes debut goal is only the start at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIT’s been a “non-stop” start to life at Dundee United for Pavol Safranko and he’s hoping an impressive debut is just the beginning of a successful spell at Tannadice.The Slovakian international was officially signed on Friday, despite having trained with the Tangerines through the week, and was quickly thrust into the starting XI at Queen of the South.Despite not having much time to settle, the 23-year-old quickly opened his scoring account for United as he looped the ball over Queens keeper Alan Martin for a goal that eventually gave his new side three points.He said: “I arrived five days before the game. It has been non-stop.“It was only five days and my first game so I need to know how my team-mates play.“I had four training sessions so it was a little bit crazy but it was good to help the team to win by scoring.“I’m happy with the start but the three points were the most important thing.“We have to start to win games but when I score it is always nice.“It was a good pass from Frederic Frans and I saw the goalkeeper went down so I just wanted to put it behind him and I think it was a good strike.“I think the first half was a good performance and we need to build on that.“The second half wasn’t perfect so we need to change something there.”Safranko joined the club on a year-long loan deal from Danish side Aalborg last week.He was well-known to manager Csaba Laszlo, though, as they worked together at Dunajska Streda (DAC) in Slovakia.There, Safranko knocked in six goals in 12 games after signing for the second half of the season as DAC went on an extended unbeaten run.And the chance to work with Csaba once more was a big draw for the striker once he heard Aalborg were happy to let him leave.He said: “I played under Csaba Laszlo in Slovakia at Dunajska Streda.“There we were unbeaten for 16 games in a row so I know what I can expect from him and I’m looking forward to playing for him again.“Csaba was the big part of why I joined Dundee United because I had a really good relationship with Csaba. I want to work for him.“I can honestly say that in Denmark there is a bit more combination football but here it is a little bit more fighting which will, hopefully, suit me better.“I can say every player dreams to play football in the United Kingdom so this was also one of the reasons I came here.”Safranko certainly knows the Scottish Championship is about “fighting” as he was given a welcome by the Queens backline.The makings of a black eye was clear in the Slovak’s face during and after the game as he battled with the Palmerston defenders.“I heard the Scottish league is quite hard – now I can feel it!” he added.“It is my style and how I play. We will see, I don’t want to speak too much because it was just my first game.”The Tangerines now have the best part of two weeks before their next Championship fixture – time Safranko thinks they can use to their advantage.“We will have time to train and I’m sure with this squad we can be much better in our next game.“The first half was our good phase because I had Nicky Clark close to me. He is a good player, and we can build on it.“Everyone fought and we have to continue with that because if just one person loses a battle, we will have problems.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7540a9bb2e3-846x564.jpg ","title":"organisers of scottish independence march give assurances as thousands more set to walk dundee streets than expected","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOrganisers of a Scottish independence march have given assurances that Saturday’s event will go off without a hitch \u0026#8211 despite potentially thousands more people turning up than originally expected.The March for Independence, organised by All Under One Banner, will see protesters take to the streets in support of breaking away from the UK.A list of notifications on Dundee City Council’s website states 1,000 marchers are expected to descend on the city.But organisers now expect anywhere between 10,000 and 20,000 people to show up.

Large-scale projects such as this are the only way to alleviate the issue.”Committee members will visit the site on October 11 and the public hearing will take place later that day at a time to be confirmed.A decision will then be made at a future committee meeting.A report sent to the council on behalf of First Endeavour said: “The proposal is fully in line with council policy, as it has been specifically designed to provide council housing to meet an identified need in Aberdeen.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"section of a90 to undergo 150000 resurfacing works1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn 800m stretch of the A90 is to undergo a major resurfacing project.A southbound stretch of the busy road, between the B974 Marykirk junction and the North Water Bridge junction will undergo £150,000 of works.The overnight work is due to begin at 7.30pm on Monday and last for four days.Lane closures will be in place during the works for safety and a 10mph convoy system will be in place.All restrictions will be lifted each day at 6.30am.Andy Thompson, BEAR Scotland’s north-east representative said: “The £150,000 overnight project will upgrade the condition of the southbound carriageway between Luther Bridge and North Water Bridge, helping to create a smoother and safer road surface and address any potholes or other road defects in the carriageway.“The traffic management is essential to ensure the safety of both our workforce as well as road users.\u0026#8220We’ll do all we can to complete the works as quickly and safely as possible.\u0026#8220We thank motorists for their patience in advance while our teams work to carry out these essential works.\u0026#8220We encourage road users to plan their journey in advance by checking the Traffic Scotland website for real time journey information and leaving some extra time to reach their destination.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/5b76749001af4-816x564.jpg ","title":"veterans ministers tells of his grandas bravery as he donates medals to aberdeen museum","story":"\t\t\t\t\tVeterans minister Graeme Dey has donated medals given to his grandfather in the Second World War to an Aberdeen war museum.Mr Dey gave the medals to the Gordon Highlanders Museum in Aberdeen to display as part of a long-term loan.The set, which includes the Military Cross, was awarded to his grandfather Major James M. McIntosh at El Alamein, Egypt, in 1942.Major McIntosh was born in Aberdeen in 1904 and lied about his age to join the Castlehill Barracks in 1921.He went on to serve as lieutenant in the 7th Battalion in 1939 and became camp commandant in 1943, before retiring from the army in November 1945.He served in Turkey, Malta, Egypt, India and Palestine.The medals which have been donated to the museum include a Member of British Empire (MBE), Military Cross (MC), 1908-1935 “Mohmaned” IGSM, a 1939-45 War Star, Africa Star for the 8th Army, Italy Star, 1939-45 Defence Medal and the 1939-45 War Medal.Mr Dey also donated Major McIntosh’s regular army long service and good conduct medal for 18 years’ service and the Civil Defence Long Service Medal for 15 years.Mr Dey travelled to the Granite City yesterday to hand the awards over.Mr Dey said: “It’s something I’d always wanted to do. The medals have been sitting in the house for years. They actually belong to my son, Lewis.“We got chatting about it and I’d long thought the place for the medals was in a facility like this.“I’ve visited museums on mainland Europe and the setup there really brings home to you that moment in history. This place brings home the history of the Gordon Highlanders and I couldn’t think of a more appropriate place for the medals to go to.“We all agreed this was the right thing to do and I was delighted at the response from the museum.“I’m looking forward to coming back and seeing them on display.”Mr Dey, MSP for Angus South, added: “He joined and rose through the ranks to become a major.“He was never too keen to talk about winning the Military Cross. I once asked him how it came about and he said ‘well, I kind of led my men into a minefield and I had to get them out of there and the best way was to go forward’.“We were incredibly proud of them and he was incredibly proud to be a Gordon Highlander.“So much so that years later he helped form the Old Comrades’ Association.“It’s great. I know he would have loved it because of his pride in the regiment.“This is what we are about in the north-east. He would always tell stories but getting him to talk about his experiences in the Second World War was really hard. Like so many of the guys, he rarely opened up about it.”Curator of the Gordon Highlanders Museum Ruth Duncan said: “We are absolutely delighted to be able to display the late major’s medals to our visitors and to share his story of service with our visitors who come through our doors every day.“While we have a sizeable collection of medals, each one tells a unique story so we’re pleased we can expand our story of the Gordon Highlanders, particularly in the Second World War. Sadly, fewer and fewer of these veterans are around so it makes it all the more important for us to remember them and continue to tell their stories.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"huntly eye cup run as they see off the broch","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHuntly caretaker manager Martin Skinner believes they can go all the way in the Evening Express Aberdeenshire Cup after winning their first-round tie.A double from Matthew McDonald gave the Black and Golds a 2-1 win against Fraserburgh at Bellslea to set up a second round tie with Deveronvale.Skinner, who has been in temporary charge since Charlie Charlesworth’s resignation just over a fortnight ago, believes the Strathbogie side can have a good run in the Shire Cup.He said: “I’m delighted for the boys because they put in a hell of a shift.“It’s a tough place to come on a Wednesday night but we dug in well.“A cup run is there for us, we’re through the first round so we’ll apply ourselves fully to every cup game and hopefully we can win it.”Skinner also praised goal-hero McDonald and added: “Matthew missed two easier chances but he took his goals well.“He works hard for you and creates chances, he’s been struggling for goals so it’s good for him to get going.”Skinner has admitted he would be keen to manage Huntly on a permanent basis as Charlesworth’s successor.He said: “I don’t know (about his chances). I’ll sit down and speak to people, this results helps me. But it was the players that won the game so they have to take credit for it.”The Broch threatened in the second minute when Scott Barbour spun his defender and fired inches wide from 15 yards.On the half-hour the Black and Golds almost took the lead.A ball down the left from Blair Johnston found Paul Napier, his flick into the area set up McDonald, but keeper Paul Leask was out quickly to smother the shot.Three minutes from half-time Huntly did lead. A long ball was flicked on and McDONALD was in behind the defence and, with Leask slightly off his line, the striker produced a brilliant lob to score from the edge of the box.The lead didn’t last though, two minutes later the Broch got a free-kick on the left, Graham Johnston drove the ball in, Euan Storrier parried but straight off Michael CLARK who diverted it into his own net.Huntly led again on 65 minutes when Napier slipped the ball through for McDONALD, who had evaded the offside trap, 12 yards out, Leask got a touch to his shot but couldn’t keep it out.Fraserburgh responded with Paul Campbell heading sub Sean Butcher’s cross from the right against the left post on 75 minutes.With eight minutes to go Huntly had Gary McGowan sent off for a gesture towards the crowd.And on 86 minutes Barbour flicked Greg Buchan’s cross on to the right post – but despite Fraserburgh’s best efforts they couldn’t equalise.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"gallery broad street and provost skenes house through the decades","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThis week we’ve searched our archives for some of our favourite images of how Broad Street and Provost Skene\u0026#8217s House have changed over the past few decades."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 30","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/07/18, 3:43 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.It was a case of \u0026#8216all\u0026#8217s well that ends well\u0026#8217 for young Adam in the Furnace hills last week.Police officers and his mum left him in no doubt of how narrow an escape he had.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough.

The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance.

Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income.

This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"soccer centre scores with support from ardrishaig community trust","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIn a fantastic boost for youth football in Mid Argyll, the Ardrishaig Community Trust and Lochgilphead Soccer Centre have jointly announce that Ardrishaig Community Trust will be the main sponsor of Lochgilphead Soccer Centre for the next three years.The funding package, worth £5,000 for each of the next three years, will make a huge contribution to the centre’s ambitious development plans – it already has more than 120 members, including around 40 from Ardrishaig.The development plan will see the Soccer Centre invest in new equipment, quality coaching to help the youngsters develop their football skills, participation in football festivals, and attend Scotland games, among other things.The funding will meet the cost of around 100 new football strips, all branded with Ardrishaig Community Trust, and will help ensure all Lochgilphead Red Star YFC teams are kitted out the same, from primary one to sevens (including the girls’ teams).The cost of kit to keep the coaches – who contribute the equivalent of around £15,000 a year in time – warm and dry throughout the year, will be part funded by the sponsorship. The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust. In the first instance this will involve running a number of football-related activities at Ardrishaig Gala Day.Hamish Nicol, chairman of the Ardrishaig Community Trust said: ‘In the official year of young people we are a delighted to support an organisation who match our ambitions to create a better tomorrow for our young people.‘The trust has been very active behind the scenes over the last few years and this three year programme of support allows us to raise our profile.’\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tech savvy feis an tairbeirt gives musicians a professional edge","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 08/08/18, 7:29 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA Fèis an Tairbeirt workshop in music production, funded by Argyll and Bute Council\u0026#8217s Supporting Communities Fund, has been voted a success.Students recorded and produced their own tracks, created soundscapes with pre-recorded sounds, composed soundtracks and provided voiceovers for pieces of film and media during the three-day event.The chance to develop these skills is not usually offered outside of higher education but thanks to the knowledge and experience of tutor Luke Schofield, Fèis an Tairbeirt was able to offer this unique opportunity to local young adults.Another course has been arranged for September 15 and 16 and is limited to six places.The course is free but anyone interested should email feisantairbeirt@gmail to book a place.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities. In front of the parade was musician Pat Kenny playing haunting tones on a carnyx, an Iron Age Celtic war horn.On the green there were stands selling everything from soap to artwork and woolly bunnets to garden shrubs.As well as battle re-enactments and weapons demonstrations there were living history demonstrations and workshops where adults and children tried their hand at traditional crafts such as spinning, weaving, metalworking, woodwork, dressing up and blowing the carnyx.Children took part in the Lughnasa Games, featuring various tests of Celtic warrior skills.Brian MacLennan of Lochgilphead Community Council said: \u0026#8216The day was a massive success and I\u0026#8217ve had lots of positive feedback.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautiful and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex (number two) from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they returned to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they returned to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terrific work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cairndow stagecoach inn up for sale","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 16/08/18, 3:03 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe three-star Cairndow Stagecoach Inn has been brought to the market for the first time since 1965.The current owner Douglas Fraser, whose family has owned the Cairndow Stagecoach for more than 50 years, is planning to retire.The hotel boasts 19 en suite letting bedrooms, spacious bar area and the Stables Restaurant.

The pitch at the school is too small to host even an under-13 game.‘For Mid Argyll Rugby Club to grow, it needs to have a home to create an identity. In recent years, plans and promises to create a rugby facility have always come to nothing and the game in Mid Argyll has suffered for it.\u0026#8216We have a Scottish School cup game on Tuesday August 28 and at the moment we are still looking for a venue. How can we compete with central belt schools, or even our neighbours in Oban, who have facilities provided by the council?’The club has steadily been developing fresh talent for more than five years, but with nowhere to play it cannot field a first 15 despite plenty of willing players.The pitch project, supported by Scottish Rugby and Argyll and Bute Rugby Development Officer Allan Wright, hopes to be open by autumn 2019.Another supporter of the project is Councillor Dougie Philand, who said: ‘I have been involved with senior rugby previously and having our own pitch was always a problem.\u0026#8216I would fully support any development or plans that would promote a permanent pitch and changing areas especially now when there is a resurgence in junior rugby. I would also be happy to be involved in any negotiations to obtain the land from the council.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"russell voices opposition to inveraray rbs closure plans","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 17/08/18, 5:48 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowArgyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell has written to the external consultants considering the future of key Royal Bank of Scotland branches to express his continued opposition to closure of the Inveraray Branch.Along with nine other rural branches, Inveraray was given a stay of execution earlier this year – but if the figures do not stack up by December 2018 the busy tourist town will be left with no bank to serve residents, businesses or visitors.Mr Russell said: \u0026#8216I have been against the slew of closures in Argyll and Bute and still am, but all those threatened have now gone with the exception of Inveraray.\u0026#8216Inveraray is a tourist magnet with a need for services for those who don’t live in the area, while tourism and other businesses require banking services.\u0026#8216Argyll and Bute Council along with other agencies are working hard to reverse the depopulation of rural parts of Argyll and Bute and the removal of such a vital service can only work to undermine this.\u0026#8217Mr Russell added: \u0026#8216It should be acknowledged that as RBS is state owned, it should have a duty of care to those who rescued it from bankruptcy.

And he is well aware that Labour must recapture votes in places like the Doon Valley if it is to regain power at Holyrood and Westminster. “This is precisely the kind of constituency we need to win back,” admitted the Scottish Labour Party leader. He made a good impression on a whistle-stop tour of Dalmellington and Bellsbank. But time will tell whether or not this will bring voters back to the fold. Mr Leonard chatted amiably to lady volunteers at the Kirk Shop, in the middle of Dalmellington. There was clearly lots of goodwill for the Yorkshire-born politician. The affable Labour leader then moved on to Dalmellington Care Centre, where he planted a red rose to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS. “My grandfather was a gardener, back in Leeds,” said Mr Leonard, as he wielded a spade. He heard about grassrooots co-operation in Dalmellinton among groups like The Zone and the care centre.  Mr Leonard said: “It’s the resilience of the people that’s keeping the Doon Valley going. “But it’s about time they were given a helping hand from government. “There are too many people living in poverty and on poverty pay. “We need investment in public services and we need to see communities having more control, with the possibility of community buy-outs.” Mr Leonard said only Labour is pledging a decade of investment. “We’re the only party opposing the austerity policies of the Tories, which are being passed on by the SNP.” He said the SNP’s own Growth Commission report revealed there would be even more austerity in an independent Scotland. And he was adamant: “The Labour Party is absolutely opposed to a second referendum on independence.”  Labour colleague Colin Smyth MSP said: “We’re seeing a growing frustration among voters on a debate focused on the constitution. “People want to see improvements in education and health.” Mr Leonard popped up to Bellsbank to see how streets are being transformed with ‘Balamory’ style painting of houses. In the afternoon, he visited the Sovereign Credit Union in Cumnock to hear about its services in the community. Then it was on to Tarbolton, to meet residents who are unhappy about their doctors’ surgery hours being cut, due to a shortage of GPs.

They resided in the old Tower on the hill, which is now in ruins. The Govans continued in possession of Cardrona until the latter end of the seventeenth century, when it was purchased by Mr Williamson, writer in Peebles, and Town Clerk of that burgh.

This was granted, and the work of demolition was soon begun. The roof was taken off and the chambers filled with earth, and in the course of a short time the effects of the weather made themselves apparent. The walls cracked in every direction, and large masses of the building fell.\nNext the crowbar was applied with great success and to make the appearance of an ancient ruin as near perfect as possible, a cartwheel was fixed in one of the largest rents, that the effect at a distance might be that of a venerable abbey. (Smails\u0026rsquo Guide, pp. 15 \u0026ndash 16)\nNether Horsburgh Castle: \u0026ldquo...we find that the lands of Easter Horseburgh, then called Schelynelaw, together with lands of Traquair and Innerleithen were, in 1634, in the hands of John Stewart of Traquair, who in that year was served heir to his brother Robert. The tradition in the family [Horseburgh] is that this part of the property was sold to defray the expenses of a lawsuit which had arisen between two brothers.\nAt Nether Horsburgh there are the remains of an old tower or keep, which used to be called Shillinglaw Tower. Tradition is silent respecting it, but it was probably built about the time the lands came into the possession of the Stewarts [sometime after 1550].

some 17 years ago, I lived on High Askomil for 25 years and before that about eight years on Low Askomil, both overlooking the beach.Long before when I was a teenager I lived in one of the prefabs on Hillside Road.My friends and I would often head for Dalintober beach, commonly known as Banana Beach, where we would spend some pocket money on Jock Shields\u0026#8217 kayaks.There were about six or seven kayaks to hire for a shilling or two and go just about anywhere, in all weathers, for an hour, not a life jacket to be seen.Jock or John Shields ran a bicycle shop on Longrow but was into many things and also had a ship carousel at Banana Beach.The carousel wasn\u0026#8217t unlike one at the fair but consisted of seven or eight little cargo ships and cruise boats, all home made I think, for one child in each boat.They were attached to a centre spindle with one ship only having an outboard motor making the whole assembly rotate.I\u0026#8217m not sure if it was Jock or someone else who hired out rowing boats from the slipway in the harbour.We would hire two seater or four seater boats, the former being cheaper and we could always pick up another crew member when out of sight of the hirer.Rowing  to the large mooring buoy in the middle of the loch was no big deal, neither was accepting a dare to ride out the wake from the Duchess of Hamilton or Montrose sideways on.I\u0026#8217m sweating thinking about it as there were no lifejackets, we must have been crazy.Other memories of Banana Beach were the toilets and shelter at the top of the pier now long gone, and the push button drinking fountain at the wall near the beach slipway.Happy days indeed.  Good luck to those trying to restore it for today\u0026#8217s generation where I\u0026#8217m certain lifejackets will be in abundance for boating adventures.Ronnie Gay,Hunters Quay.The queue to have a go at Dalintober Beach Group\u0026#8217s assault course at the inaugural Campbeltown Community Regatta.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

The proposal to turn the library, which as built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0027s Aldhammer House, were first put to the public in June 2016.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.

Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.

It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.

Helen Mulgray wrote: \u0026ldquoI was shocked to see how the cleanliness of the toilets had deteriorated.  \u0026ldquoThese once highly praised, award-winning toilets have been degraded to become offensive and at times a health hazard \u0026ndash no soap to wash hands and no toilet paper unless [it is] picked off the floor.  She described the condition of the toilets as a \u0026ldquodisgraceful memory of a visit to North Berwick for the thousands of visitors that flock to the town every summer.  East Lothian Council is currently proposing to cut the permanent toilet attendants at the county\u0026rsquos public loos and instead see them maintained by an extended team of mobile attendants.  Ms Mulgray slammed the council for the proposal, adding: \u0026ldquoImplementing the proposed plan to do away with full-time attendants means this mess will be a permanent sight for visitors to the toilets.  \u0026ldquoIt takes no account of the crowds coming from the beach until late, busloads stopping at the car park, and events like the Fringe [by the Sea] and the [Highland] Games.  \u0026ldquoIs saving money this way more important than the tourist image of North Berwick?  Ms Mulgray added that when she returned to the toilets last Monday, they were \u0026ldquospotless.  She put the improvements down to the fact that the usual full-time attendant had returned from annual leave.  Ms Mulgray wrote to the council to express her concerns about the toilets being allowed to deteriorate last week and, in a response seen by the Courier, Lorraine Faulds, senior officer of facilities management, wrote: \u0026ldquoLooking at your specific concerns with North Berwick toilets, it has been maintained by a combination of permanent and mobile attendants for more than six years.  \u0026ldquoThis pattern has ensured appropriate levels of cleanliness throughout the year and includes recognition of the busier summer months.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that at any toilet, on any occasion, whether by intent or accident, toilets or sinks can be blocked by paper or left as debris.  \u0026ldquoFortunately these remain isolated incidents at our sites and North Berwick toilets actually have a more frequent attendance by the mobile attendants than some of our other sites.  She said the emptying of sanitary bins would increase from once a week to twice due to Ms Mulgray\u0026rsquos complaint of them \u0026ldquooverflowing.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial.

That has led to questions being asked as to how the current doctors\u0026rsquo surgery, on Newton Port, will cope with the increase in people.  Fiona-Frances Adam, one of the town\u0026rsquos community councillors, raised the issue with councillors.  She asked: \u0026ldquoWhat are they going to be doing?  \u0026ldquoAre they going to extend the surgery with all the incoming people?  \u0026ldquoThey are stretched.  Land was previously earmarked for a new doctors\u0026rsquo surgery to be created on the site of the new East Lothian Community Hospital, which is currently being built on the site of the former Roodlands Hospital.  The new hospital is expected to be complete in 2020 but no planning application has been submitted for a GP surgery at any site in the town, including the hospital and within the new Letham Mains development, which is sandwiched between the B6471 and the A6093.  Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the community council, said: \u0026ldquoWhere the surgery is at the moment is central.  \u0026ldquoI think as far as I am led to believe there is supposed to be a doctors\u0026rsquo surgery in the Letham Main development.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership told the Courier that discussions had been taking place with Haddington GPs on how to support the growing population for \u0026ldquosome time.

Provost John McMillan, a councillor for Haddington and Lammermuir ward, said planning the development of any future health facility had to be carefully weighed up.  Mr McMillan also noted the variety of services which would be included within the new \u0026pound70 million hospital.

Nicola Pryde, director of the nursery group, which is already open on Meadowpark and has another facility in Dunblane, Stirling, said that the new centre had been opened to meet demand as the town sees more families moving in.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe wanted a second site because of the waiting list we had at Meadowpark and were delighted to be able to take on the former B\u0026ampB on West Road.  \u0026ldquoOur open day showed how much nursery places are in demand and with all the new houses being built we knew there was a need for it.  \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have a second nursery in Haddington.

According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos head of education, stressed the local authority was \u0026ldquoabsolutely committed to continuously improving the quality of education at the two schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans.

The scheme will apply to the section of the town north of the railway line, with major roads such as Belhaven Road also included.  All roads affected previously had 30mph speed limits.  The new order, which is an experimental order, will mirror what is already in place south of the East Coast Mainline in the Hallhill area of the town, where all the streets, with the exception of Kellie Road, are 20mph.  Herbert Coutts, from the town\u0026rsquos community council, has been heavily involved in moving the project forward and was pleased to see progress being made.

He added: \u0026ldquoIt was never thought by people supporting it that it was a magic answer to all our speeding problems but a step in the right direction and people become accustomed to going at 20mph in the town.  \u0026ldquoThereby the safety of pedestrians \u0026ndash particularly children and elderly but people of any age \u0026ndash will be enhanced.  \u0026ldquoThat is the hope and hopefully people will observe it.

If the order is deemed a success, steps will be taken to see the 20mph speed limit become a permanent fixture.  Feedback from members of the public could also help decide whether any roads become exempt from the 20mph speed limit in the future.  Currently there are no plans for traffic calming measures, such as speed humps or chicanes, on the streets affected by the new speed limit.

The findings come at the same time as overall employment in the county has increased slightly.  Figures show that the number of people in either part-time or full-time employment in East Lothian rose to 78.6 per cent between April 2017 and March 2018, an increase of 3.6 per cent from the previous year, when the rate was at 75 per cent.  Councillor Brian Small, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoObviously the fact that 4,000 households are without work is worrying.  \u0026ldquoWork isn\u0026rsquot only important for the financial benefits to those in employment, it also generates health and social benefits for them.  \u0026ldquoHaving something to get up in the morning for is good for you.  \u0026ldquoBut we have to welcome that East Lothian is better than both the UK and Scottish average but there is still more that can and should be done to get people back into work.  Peter Dicker of East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the statistics for the increase in the population in work is encouraging, the foodbank can only comment on the fact that over the same period that the statistics were compiled for April 2017 to March 2018 we here at East Lothian Foodbank experienced a 12 per cent increase on the number of referrals we had sent to us \u0026ndash this 12 per cent compares to a national average of a 13 per cent increase on referrals (Trussell Trust stats).  \u0026ldquoSince the introduction of Universal Credit in April 2016 we have seen an increase in people being referred to us by over 45 per cent (April 16 to March 17 was 37 per cent increase).  The figures from the ONS estimate that last year 14 per cent of households in East Lothian were workless, lower than the Scotland-wide average of 18 per cent.  County MP Martin Whitfield said: \u0026ldquoClearly the increase in the local employment rate over the last year is welcome. However, the fact there are still many people out of work remains a concern. It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray added: \u0026ldquoI welcome the fact that East Lothian\u0026rsquos employment rate is higher than the Scottish average. However, too many local people are still not in work. We need a fundamental shift in how we grow our economy.  \u0026ldquoWe also need to ensure opportunities for creating these kind of jobs locally are maximised at the former Cockenzie Power Station site and the new innovation park at QMU.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.

Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-pet-idol-see-the-top-50","story":"  Pictured here are all the 50 pets still in the running.

Currently the world record for players involved in a continuous game of rugby is 442.  Now Haddington RFC president Keith Wallace is waiting for official confirmation that a new record has been set.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe day was a fantastic occasion despite the worst day of weather all summer, and we were delighted by the huge effort and support from the club and the rugby and local communities in getting past the record.  \u0026ldquoAs a celebration of the town\u0026rsquos 700 years of the Royal Charter it was a great success, with the match kicked off by Provost John McMillan, and great support from the town, with particular thanks to the boys\u0026rsquo football team who arrived late on, like the cavalry, to help get us over the line.  \u0026ldquoMore than that, though, it was brilliant to see players [aged] from five to 73 enjoying our great game, with several cases of three generations from the same family playing at the same time, including one connected family group of 18.  \u0026ldquoThis is the power of rugby. We look forward to seeing many of our record-breakers back at the club in the near future.  \u0026ldquoWe would also like to thank the Royal Bank of Scotland, sponsors of RugbyForce day of which we were one of two top prize winners, without whose support the event would not have been possible \u0026ndash in particular their many staff, including a good number from the local branch who helped massively on the day.  The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.  Following their \u0026pound1,000 win for their successful application as part of the Royal Bank RugbyForce initiative, delivered in partnership with Scottish Rugby, Haddington\u0026rsquos event organisers will now submit evidence of the record for verification from Guinness World Records.  Haddington RFC will also use the prize money to contribute towards a recruitment drive to increase playing numbers at all levels and fund community engagement projects.  Haddington RFC\u0026rsquos charity partner Wooden Spoon were also in attendance on the day.  Mr Wallace, who took part in the early stages of the mammoth six-hour match, thanked current Scotland internationalists Stuart McInally, Willem Nel and Sarah Law while there was also an appearance from ex-Lions and Scotland forward Finlay Calder, who grew up in Haddington. Mr Wallace said: \u0026ldquoIt made a huge difference \u0026ndash the kids loved seeing them and they were great."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8263446.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"new-headteacher-wants-to-make-knox-academy-a-flagship-school-for-east-lothian","story":"  Susan Cook took charge at the Haddington school this week after moving from Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Trinity Academy, where she was acting headteacher.  Pupils returned on Wednesday, with Ms Cook planning a series of assemblies to introduce herself to the students.  She said: \u0026ldquoI would like to make Knox Academy a flagship school in East Lothian \u0026ndash Scotland, potentially.  \u0026ldquoI want all young people to leave to a positive destination but be healthy and happy as they move through the school and really enjoy their school experience.  \u0026ldquoI want pupils to enjoy education in the widest sense, not just the curriculum but wider activities, and to develop as rounded individuals when they leave school to meet the demands of an ever-changing society.  Ms Cook, who lives in the county, previously worked in Edinburgh at a number of schools, including Drummond Community High School, Leith Academy and Tynecastle Academy.  The teacher, who has a background in physical education, started on Monday.  Two in-service days gave her the chance to meet the staff before pupils arrived.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe staff seem fantastic, a creative group of people. They really are keen for the school to engage with the challenge.  Ms Cook has also vowed not to remain in her office at the school but instead wants to get out and about and speak to the pupils and staff.  She said: \u0026ldquoI found when I was at Trinity Academy, the headteacher and the senior leadership team were in the middle of the school. With an open foyer, you saw pupils pass.  \u0026ldquoI think it could be easy to shut the door and stay in the room. That is not what I want to do, I want to get out and about.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot really like sitting about, I want to engage with people. That is the best way to learn what makes the school tick, the young people and the staff tick.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, East Lothian Council spokeswoman for education and children\u0026rsquos services and a Haddington ward councillor, said: \u0026ldquoI was delighted when Susan Cook was appointed as headteacher of Knox Academy.  \u0026ldquoShe brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the school from her posts in Edinburgh, which include Trinity Academy.  \u0026ldquoI welcome her to the East Lothian team and look forward to supporting her at the school as the local ward councillor."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8263472.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"new-dunbar-grammar-school-headteacher-hails-magical-community","story":"  Claire Slowther took the helm on Monday after succeeding the now-retired Paul Raffaelli, who had been headteacher for more than a decade.  Mrs Slowther, previously one of the school\u0026rsquos depute headteachers, was looking forward to the new term, with pupils starting back at school on Wednesday.  She said: \u0026ldquoI absolutely love the school.  \u0026ldquoLots of people say it about Dunbar, that it is a really special community.  \u0026ldquoThere is really something quite magical about the school and the community.  \u0026ldquoThe youngsters here are just tremendous and the friendliness you get from young people and staff \u0026ndash it is a really caring place.  Currently the school is undergoing a large-scale expansion, which is due to be fully complete in early November.  Ahead of the new term starting, a section of the extension has been opened, which will give access to six new classrooms.  More than \u0026pound10 million is being spent on the extension, which includes a new two-storey L-shaped block to the east side of the school.  It will not only be home to new classrooms but also a home economics department, new library and learning centre with a dedicated IT space, and additional PE changing rooms.  Mrs Slowther, who has previously worked at both Knox Academy in Haddington and Ross High School, Tranent, felt it was a \u0026ldquophenomenally exciting time for the school.  The 36-year-old, who is joined by Ed Offer and Richard Maxton as depute headteachers, as well as Suzanne Hamilton as acting depute headteacher, said staff were taking the school into a new era.  The new headteacher, who was previously a biology teacher, added staff had talked about what they could do \u0026ldquoto preserve what is really special and how we continue delivering absolutely the best education for every young person that comes through our doors.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe call it Sunny Dunny. It is a sunny, cheerful, caring place \u0026ndash within the classrooms, corridors and out in the community.  \u0026ldquoWhen parents come in, they are so friendly and supportive as well.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, East Lothian Council spokeswoman for education and children\u0026rsquos services, welcomed the new headteacher.  She said: \u0026ldquoI wish Claire Slowther all the best in her role as headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8263580.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"whats-on-this-weekend-five-ideas-of-things-to-do-in-east-lothian","story":"  1.

Mr Khan\u0026rsquos populist Tehrik-e-Insaf party won the most seats in July 25 elections but fell short of a majority in the 342-seat house.  He will be sworn in as prime minister on Saturday, with a five-year mandate.  His supporters celebrated across the country when speaker Asad Qaiser announced result.  In his first speech to lawmakers as premier, Mr Khan dismissed allegations of election fraud and vowed to enforce \u0026ldquoruthless accountability to combat corruption.  Mr Khan is a former Oxford graduate and formed his party in 1996 in the eastern city of Lahore, vowing to forge a corruption-free \u0026ldquonew Pakistan with justice for all without discrimination.  He challenged the parties of Mr Sharif and former president Asif Ali Zardari over the past two decades, but was not able to make a strong showing until 2013 when his became the third-largest party in the lower house of parliament.  Mr Sharif is the younger brother of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who is serving a 10-year jail term in a corruption case.  The elder Sharif, who served as premier three times, was disqualified last year by the Supreme Court for concealing assets abroad.  Later, an anti-corruption tribunal convicted and sentenced him to 10 years in jail over the family\u0026rsquos purchase of luxury apartments in London.  Mr Khan has in recent years led widespread protest rallies against Sharif\u0026rsquos government after the 2013 elections, alleging ballot rigging.  Addressing lawmakers, the younger Sharif insisted that last month\u0026rsquos elections were manipulated in Mr Khan\u0026rsquos favour.  He and his supporters chanted slogans against Mr Khan during his speech, claiming he was brought to power by the military.  Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, head of opposition Pakistan People\u0026rsquos Party, in his first speech as lawmaker, also claimed that the national elections were rigged, \u0026ldquowhich was a shame.  Mr Khan insisted that neither Mr Sharif nor any other person would politically strong-arm him through protests.  The new premier acquired a reputation as a playboy during his cricketing years but has since embraced conservative Islam after entering politics.  He has married three times. His first wife was wealthy British heiress Jemima Goldsmith, who he married in 1996. Their two sons live with Ms Goldsmith, who has publicly supported Mr Khan\u0026rsquos political ambitions and praised his skill as a leader, even after their divorce in 2004.  His married his second wife, British journalist Rehman Khan, in 2015. They divorced within a year.  Earlier this year, he married his spiritual adviser, Bushra Maneka.  In his 2011 book Pakistan: A Personal History, Mr Khan noted his ambition to come to power when his Islamic nation was ready to hold free and fair elections.  Aside from tackling corruption, and a vision to introduce \u0026ldquosurgical reforms in governance, one of the key challenges facing him is how to improve ties with the US.  He was elected a day after the Foreign Ministry confirmed the suspension of a US military training programme for Pakistani soldiers. The announcement underscores persistent tensions between the two allies in the war on terror.  Mr Khan had previously described President Donald Trump\u0026rsquos policies towards Pakistan as \u0026ldquoflawed."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/7950445.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"deeann-fitzpatrick-bound-and-gagged-scottish-government-agency-worker-loses-case","story":"  DeeAnn Fitzpatrick claimed she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland.  At an employment tribunal in Aberdeen in June the 49-year-old Canadian national said she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards, claiming she was targeted with sexual harassment and for being a woman, as well as over her age.  The abuse was said to have taken place between 2015 and 2017 while she was based in the government body\u0027s Scrabster office in the Highlands and continued after she was signed off.  In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick alleged she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.  However it is understood the tribunal was unable to consider that allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.  The employment tribunal ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.  In its judgment the tribunal said it could not agree whether the cards could be said to have been likely to come from current colleagues.

The council said it is the first local authority in the UK to offer free sanitary provision in all of its public buildings.  It comes after the local authority introduced free sanitary products in its secondary schools last August, with young women accessing more than 13,000 free sanitary towels and tampons while at school in the last year.  Council leader Joe Cullinane said: \"Sanitary products are a necessity, not a choice. I wish for no women or girl here in North Ayrshire to find themselves in the embarrassing and often degrading situation of having to use improper sanitary protection simply because they cannot afford it.  \"After all, periods are not exempt from poverty - they don\u0027t take account of what is in your pocket or purse. Therefore, it is absolutely right that we should look at ways in which to tackle this gendered inequality.  \"This latest announcement in our period poverty programme aims to help address the issue and make period poverty history in North Ayrshire.\"  A study published by girls\u0027 rights charity Plan International UK earlier this year found that 45% of those living in Scotland said they have been forced to use makeshift sanitary wear including socks or newspapers because they have struggled to buy products.  The Scottish Government is rolling out a project to provide free sanitary products to women from low-income households across Scotland following a pilot scheme in Aberdeen, while free sanitary products will also be available to those at school, college or university from this month.  Scottish Labour MSP Monica Lennon, who is bringing forward a Member\u0027s Bill to create a statutory duty for free provision of sanitary products, welcomed the scheme in North Ayrshire.  She said: \"Councillor Cullinane and North Ayrshire Council are leading the way on ending period poverty.  \"Access to sanitary products should be a right, regardless of your income, which is why I am moving ahead with plans for legislation to introduce a universal system of free access to sanitary products for everyone in Scotland.  \"I\u0027m delighted that North Ayrshire will extend free sanitary product provision to all of its public buildings and I hope other organisations will follow their lead.  \"No-one should face the indignity of being unable to access these essential products to manage their period.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8251596.jpg?type=article-full","title":"football-chiefs-reject-petition-backed-by-thousands-calling-for-scotland-to-boycott-matches-against-israel","story":"  Nearly 3000 have backed a campaign to have Scotland withdraw from fixtures against Israel away on October 11 and at home on November 20 in the inaugural Uefa Nations League.  A petition launched by the Scottish Palestinian Solidarity Campaign calls on the Scottish Football Association to support a Palestinian call to suspend the Israeli Football Association (IFA) from FIFA, the world football governing body, \"until Israel respects the human rights of Palestinians and observes international law\".  In the meantime the campaigners say that the SFA should withdraw from the international matches.  The SPSC said in its petition: \"While the state of Israel continues to violate Palestinian rights with impunity...\u0026nbspthe SFA could make a significant contribution toward the goal of freedom for the Palestinian people and equal rights for all in Israel/Palestine.\"    But the SFA has said it has no plans to comply while the Israeli Embassy in London has said allegations made about Israel\u0027s actions were \"hate-laden\".  An SFA spokesman \u0026nbspsaid: \u0026ldquoWe are aware of the situation in the West Bank territory.\u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoWe have consulted with UEFA, under whose jurisdiction both competitive UEFA Nations League ties with Israel fall, and with FIFA as the world governing body of the game.\u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoWe note and agree with the positions of both organisations that interference, even in a football context, could potentially aggravate the situation and that football should remain politically neutral.  In June, Lionel Messi\u0027s Argentina called off a pre-World Cup exhibition match with Israel following political pressure and claims of threats towards players, sparking outrage from Israeli officials.  The head of the Palestinian football federation Jibril Rajoub had called on Arab and Muslim sports fans to burn photos and T-shirts of Lionel Messi if he attended the friendly.    The Palestinian FA said in a statement after the friendly had been called off: \u0026ldquoThe president of the Palestinian Federation of Football General Gabriel Rajoub confirmed that the Argentine Football Federation cancelled his game with Israel\u0026rsquos team... on the land of Jerusalem, as a result of the efforts of the Palestinians with the assistance of regional and international federations.  \u0026ldquoThe will of values, ethics and the message of sport had triumphed today, and the red card had been lifted in Israel\u0026rsquos face by cancelling this match.  The Israeli Football Association (IFA) laid the blame for the cancellation squarely on the shoulders of Rajoub describing \"physical and brutal threats that crossed every red line\".    Israel Embassy spokesman Yehuda Avivi\u0026nbsp pointed to a \"comprehensive independent report\" from last year that\u0026nbspalleged that up to 50% of activists involved with a Scottish pro-Palestine group hold anti-semitic views.  The paper by Jewish Human Rights Watch, based on a study of comments made on social media by core supporters of the Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign, claims that almost as many deny the Holocaust and liken it to a Jewish conspiracy theory. It claimed\u0026nbspmany are guilty of posting anti-semitic images and conspiracy theories about global Jewish domination.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAt the time the SPSC said it was \"not inclined to take seriously the so-called research\" and claimed it was part of an attempt to smear organisations that support Palestinian rights.  \"Given its failure to address the rampant racism and bigotry within its very own ranks, it is surprising that the SPSC should have the temerity to obsessively single out a democratic state in which the rights of all are protected,\" said Mr Avivi.  \"The SPSC\u0026rsquos hate-laden accusations will do nothing to advance the peace between Israelis and Palestinians we all seek.\"  The SPSC has said the allegations by the Israeli embassy are \"utterly false and levelled at us because we oppose Israeli snipers massacring Palestinian demonstrators\"."},{"url":null,"title":"universal-basic-income-is-attempt-to-euthanise-the-working-class-as-a-concept","story":"  Tom Kibasi, director of the left-wing Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), insisted the scheme was to the UK\u0027s economic problems \"what snake oil is to medicine\".

It comes after Nicola Sturgeon pledged to fund research into a universal basic income (UBI) last year, with \u0026pound250,000 set aside for potential pilots in four council areas. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has also said pilots could be included in the next Labour manifesto.  Mr Kibasi was debating the issue at the Edinburgh International Book Festival with economist and basic income campaigner Annie Miller and economist and journalist Stewart Lansley.  Ms Miller, co-founder of Citizen\u0026rsquos Basic Income Network Scotland, suggested every adult could be paid \u0026pound162 a week. This would be funded by hiking income tax to at least 45%.  The IPPR previously said such a scheme would cost \u0026pound20 billion a year in Scotland and would risk making child poverty worse.  Agreeing the economy is in crisis and in need of fundamental reform, Mr Kibasi said a basic income was seductive \"precisely because it\u0027s a big idea, but the problem is that big ideas aren\u0027t necessarily good ideas\".  He added: \"My real objection to UBI is that it lets capitalism off the hook. It is giving in, it is embracing defeat.\"  He said the policy was widely supported by Silicon Valley tycoons such as Elon Musk, former Google chairman Eric Schmidt and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg \u0026ndash as well as Richard Branson.  He continued: \"In politics you always get strange bedfellows \u0026ndash that\u0027s absolutely the case. But if you\u0027re going to get into bed with the billionaires, you\u0027ve got to ask yourself, \u0027Why are they in favour of it?\u0027  \"The reason is that UBI actually maintains unequal power relations.\"  He said introducing a basic income risked leaving 20 or 30 per cent of the population as a \u0026ldquodependent class, and insisted it was \u0026ldquotrying to attempt a form of kind of euthanasia for the working class as a political category and a political concept.  Dismissing the idea as \u0026ldquomagical thinking, he argued money should instead be spent on building good homes, boosting the budget of the NHS or improving schools.  He also insisted UBI would \"solidify and reinforce\" gender inequality, because women would come under pressure to stay at home and look after their children.  He added: \"UBI is to our economic problems what snake oil is to medicine.\"  Glasgow, Edinburgh, Fife and North Ayrshire councils are all considering basic income pilots.  They will be ready to begin their trials in March 2020 \u0026ndash subject to a final decision on whether or not the proposals are feasible.  Supporters deny the scheme is being held up as a \"silver bullet\" that will solve all of society\u0027s problems.  Ms Miller said UBI would help \"emancipate\" people and prevent poverty, and branded the current social security system \u0026ldquovery cruel.  But she said it would need to be introduced gradually to prevent disruption and allow the system to settle in.  She said UBI would live up to the four words engraved on the mace in the Scottish Parliament: justice, integrity, compassion and wisdom.  \"I can\u0027t think of a better foundation for a society than a basic income, bringing about some of these changes that I hope will happen,\" she added.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe are interested in any proposals to help reduce poverty and inequality.  \"We have awarded \u0026pound250,000 over the next two years to four local authorities developing work that seeks to better understand the impact of a citizen\u0026rsquos basic income \u0026ndash including costs, benefits and savings."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8251026.jpg?type=article-full","title":"secrets-of-lost-nuclear-bunker-to-be-revealed","story":"  As the bombs fell, men from the Royal Observation Corps (ROC) were to shelter within the tiny underground bunkers, monitoring the size of the blasts and plotting the course of the radioactive fallout as it spread across the country.  Isolated from each other, but connected with a communications network, the monitoring posts were built as an insurance policy against a day it was hoped would never come.  But as the threat of an atomic exchange receded, they fell into disuse and were abandoned as relics of a darker time, with few remaining intact today.  Yet now the secrets of one of the last nuclear monitoring post\u0026rsquos left in Scotland are to be revealed for the first time in more than 20 years through a project being undertaken to uncover the lost history of a remote part of the North East.    Little can be seen of the bunker above ground  At first glance, the fields of Inverharroch Farm on the Cabrach are an unlikely place for a stronghold from the height of the Cold War.  But it was from here that a three-man squad would watch mushroom clouds spreading from the ruins of Aberdeen, Dundee and other population centres if ther Soviets had ever launched their missiles.  There used to be ROC monitoring posts every 10-15 miles, with the Cabrach, which has been closed since 1992, site neighbouring those in Findhorn and Elgin.  George Anthony from Keith was a former group officer for the ROC and worked at the Drummuir site. He explained what the organisation was tasked to do.  He said: \"Ten thousand observers were part of the Royal Observer Corps around the country and I started out as an observer at a monitoring post in Drummuir. When I was promoted to group officer I looked after four posts in Moray.  \"If we came under attack, our job was to plot the flash going off and the pressure of the nuclear burst.  \"Even in peacetime we had to take readings from instruments every five to 10 minutes so each shift was very busy.  He added: \"There was no heating, though, and the only air was via a small vent and the access shaft, so you had to be hardy.\"    Access is provided through a deep shaft  Sunk 20 feet under the ground, the reinforced concrete bunkers were designed to survive an atomic blast, with access provided by a single ladder descending from a turf-covered steel manhole on the surface.  Inside, there was enough space for three servicemen to live for a period of up to three weeks after a nuclear attack, although conditions were cramped.  Each bunker comprised only a single room, with mapping and monitoring equipment crammed into the living space, along with an adjacent chemical toilet.  From here, the ROC officers would trace the shifting patterns of deadly radioactive fallout blowing on the wind and relay the information to larger underground centres, such as the Troywood bunker in Fife \u0026ndash a 24,000 sq ft facility now open as The Secret Bunker tourist attraction.    Conditions inside were cramped  Andy Fairgrieve from Dufftown, who also manages the arts programme of a nearby Speyside distillery, has visited more than 200 decommissioned nuclear bunkers around Scotland, Northern Ireland and the North East of England.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf you were on duty when the bombs dropped then you had to stay in the bunker. The data you provided would have helped the government to establish the effects on the country and to help any survivors.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe nuclear posts were located around 10 to 15 miles apart and were organised into clusters which communicated between themselves.  \u0026ldquoThe Cabrach bunker, or \u0026lsquoPost 32\u0026rsquo, was part of the Aberdeen Section. The UK\u0026rsquos network of bunkers were reorganised from 1968 onwards, with a number of them being closed down, although Post 32 remained operational until the early 1990\u0026rsquos when the Royal Observer Corps was stood down.  \u0026ldquoMost are now flooded, burned out or permanently locked by the landowner but this one remains in remarkably good condition and I\u0026rsquom really looking forward to showing people around it.  The bunker, which will be opened for one day on Saturday 18 August, is under the care of the Cabrach Trust, which plans to work with historians to convert the existing farm steading into a historically-accurate distillery, heritage centre and cafe as a significant new tourist attraction. All profits will be reinvested locally in jobs, housing and infrastructure.  \u0026ldquoHeritage isn\u0026rsquot just all about ancient history, said the Executive Director of The Cabrach Trust, Sue Savege.  \u0026ldquoThe nuclear bunker is part of the Cabrach\u0026rsquos very recent history and is a fascinating chapter in of the area\u0026rsquos long and interesting heritage. The story behind this bunker will eventually be documented alongside the rest of the history of the Cabrach in our new heritage centre.  \"The Open Day will give us an opportunity to give an update on how work is progressing on the heritage centre, and we\u0026rsquoll be offering a \u0026lsquovirtual tour\u0026rsquo of the site."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8251269.jpg?type=article-full","title":"fans-take-high-road-for-last-runrig-gigs","story":"  Tens of thousands of fans are this weekend making one last pilgrimage to hear Runrig play Loch Lomond. For they and their true loves - as the band\u0026rsquos floorfilling cover nearly goes - will never meet again.  The six-piece has sold 47,000 tickets for farewell concerts in Stirling today and tomorrow that will bring down the curtain on 45 years of their groundbreaking brand of Celtic folk rock.  Their fans - many in the Hebrides - have struggled to afford or arrange the journey with Calmac warning ferries were full and extra flights from the islands put on to cater for extra demand.  Against a backdrop of Stirling Castle, Runrig will perform, for just two last times, what amounts soundtrack of the last few turbulent decades of Scottish history, through two devolution referendums and 2014\u0026rsquos big vote.  The group - despite some changed faces - says it has a special bond with its fans, many of whom were enjoying rock in their own language for the first time. But the time, the musicians said, had come to bow out.  Vocalist Bruce Guthro said: \u0026ldquoI think we\u0026rsquore ready. I think we\u0026rsquore very proud of what we\u0026rsquove accomplished and we\u0026rsquore ready to give Scotland the show of a lifetime.  The Canadian, who has been touring with Runrig for 20 years, said of his time with the group: \u0026ldquoAll of it has been special. It\u0026rsquos almost impossible to pick certain highlights - it\u0026rsquos just been a great journey.  \u0026ldquoThe fans are are a family unto themselves and they are without question the driving force behind this band.  Since forming on Skye in 1973, Runrig have produced 14 studio albums and performed at Edinburgh Castle, the Royal Albert Hall and in New York\u0026rsquos Times Square.  They are hailed for their contribution to Scottish music, the Gaelic language and Scotland\u0026rsquos cultural identity. Though they were never entirely happy to be seen as a kitsch symbol of Scottishness.    Founding member Rory MacDonald said it is a love of performing that has kept the group going through the decades.  The bass player said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tended just to go from album to album, we\u0026rsquove never had a grand plan, or the idea we\u0026rsquore going to take over the world - none of that stuff.  \u0026ldquoVery early on, maybe after the third album, we knew very much that this was what we wanted to do with our lives. It wasn\u0026rsquot for fame or fortune, it was just that we loved playing music and playing together.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove always had that sense of being comfortable with what we\u0026rsquore doing. That\u0026rsquos the way it has worked for us.  Guitarist Malcolm Jones added: \u0026ldquoIf you\u0026rsquod said then that 45 years later we\u0026rsquod still be doing this, you\u0026rsquod have thought no way, not a chance.  Jones said concerts - called Last Dance - marked the end of an era for the band but other projects would continue, including looking after the group\u0026rsquos legacy.  Keyboard player Brian Hurren admitted there has been nerves ahead of the final concerts.  He said: \u0026ldquoI would say it\u0026rsquos unlike any other show I\u0026rsquove experienced with the band. I\u0026rsquove had sleepless nights and I\u0026rsquove had elation and excitement, sadness - everything. It\u0026rsquos been an incredible journey.  \u0026ldquoThere are a lot of fans that can\u0026rsquot get to see us because they\u0026rsquore in Australia or places that are just too far away, but they have been trying to make it over for this show, which is amazing.  Meeting the band ahead of the concerts, Scotland\u0026rsquos Deputy First Minister John Swinney thanked Runrig for their \u0026ldquoextraordinary contribution to Scotland\u0026rsquos cultural life.  He tweeted: \u0026ldquoA very special privilege to thank Runrig1973 on behalf of Scottish Government for all they have done to strengthen Scottish traditional music, the Gaelic language and Scotland in 45 years of amazing music.  \u0026ldquoThey have been such an important part of Scotland\u0026rsquos incredible journey.    Mr Swinney\u0026rsquos SNP colleague Pete Wishart MP formerly played keyboards for the band. Mr Wishart had said he would never join the SNP when interviewed in 1991.  Speaking to writer Peter Ross in last weekend\u0026rsquos Herald Magazine, Mr Wishart stressed his band\u0026rsquos part in helping Scotland learning to love and appreciate a sense of itself as confident and assertive. He added: \u0026ldquoAll the other political changes could never have happened without a feeling that what we have in Scotland is important and worth celebrating.  The band did not write Loch Lomond. But the traditional song\u0026rsquos lyrics may offer some consolation. \u0026ldquoThe broken heart it kens nae second spring again, it goes. \u0026ldquoThough the waeful may cease frae their grieving."},{"url":null,"title":"teachers-and-parents-sound-off-to-swinney-on-education-policy","story":"  Marie, a mother of twins, contacted a live radio phone-in with Mr Swinney to raise the treatment of her disabled daughter at school.  Now educating her children at home, Marie told the minister her daughter was given little or no help despite being unable to get dressed or go to the toilet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWhen there was no learning assistant about her class teacher asked her twin to take her to the toilet. Obviously at 10-years-old \u0026hellip both of them were very upset.  \u0026ldquoShe was left in the changing room, the teacher never got her changed, her twin had to do that, then got in trouble for taking too long.  \u0026ldquoIf she approached a supply teacher to ask for help they would say a child of her age should be able to get dressed herself.  Mr Swinney said her experiences were \u0026ldquototally unacceptable and pledged to look into the situation.  \u0026ldquoIndividual local authorities have got to make the assessment of how to fulfil the needs of individual children, but what you\u0026rsquove recounted to me is very clearly not acceptable, he said.  It was one of a number of difficult calls Mr Swinney fielded during his hour-long appearance on BBC Scotland\u0026rsquos Kaye Adams Show, hosted by Stephen Jardine.  Mr Swinney conceded it had been a challenging time in Scottish education and it was clear the parents, grandparents and teachers who phoned in from across the country shared that view.  Lesley, from the Scottish Borders, said pupils were being placed under too much exam pressure and were not taught properly.  She said her granddaughters had sat exams with questions that had not been covered by their school.  Mr Swinney stressed the importance of pupils being supported and said they should be fully taught courses.  \u0026ldquoBut they\u0026rsquore not, came the frustrated reply. \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot think the system is working and it is punishing children very badly. It is robbing them of their confidence.  Susan, a primary school teacher and headteacher for 39 years, accused Mr Swinney of failing to address workload pressures and teacher shortages.  She said the profession was \u0026ldquohaemorrhaging teachers because morale was \u0026ldquoso low, telling Mr Swinney: \u0026ldquoYou have a real crisis with recruitment and retention.  \u0026ldquoA number of my friends started out as teachers at the same time I did and out of all of those talented committed individuals I was the only one that lasted until 60.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot hear anything there that you have said this morning that would convince me that you have got a handle on this.  Another listener from North Lanarkshire texted to say her secondary school had been short of a chemistry teacher for five years.  Mr Swinney said he accepted teaching was demanding, but said he had engaged with teachers to reduce their workload.  He added: \u0026ldquoWhat we have got us a very challenging period in education. We have some staff shortages, he said.  Predictably, Mr Swinney was also put under pressure on primary school testing.  The Education Secretary said the assessments would help teachers identify issues as pupils progressed, but there was strong opposition.  Tommy, a teacher from the Highlands, said the tests jarred with current classroom practice.  \u0026ldquoThe requirement for recording assessments in primary school is bordering on the ridiculous. It\u0026rsquos another thing added to the list.  And Stuart, who starts a primary school teaching qualification on Monday, said he had \u0026ldquoreal worries arguing the tests were \u0026ldquonot needed and not wanted."},{"url":null,"title":"shining-a-spotlight-on-highs-and-lows-in-the-political-world","story":"  Brexit continued to dominate the political landscape, imperilling Theresa May\u0026rsquos leadership, and generating ever greater tensions between the UK and Scottish governments.  The strain led to a series of constitutional firsts.  MSPs passed legislation despite the Presiding Officer warning it was invalid, prompting a Supreme Court challenge, and Holyrood rejected the UK\u0026rsquos main Brexit bill as a \u0026ldquopower-grab, but Westminster imposed it regardless, prompting a fierce debate on the value of the Sewel Convention.  With Ms Sturgeon staying silent on a second independence referendum, a frustrated Yes movement took it on itself to organise a series of huge marches demanding a new vote.

It comes amid complaints of an Edinburgh Tattoo performance being disturbed by the nearby Rag\u0026lsquoN\u0026rsquo Bone Man gig in Princes Street Gardens.  Controversy erupted last week over blackboards that prevent the public seeing ticketed concerts in the gardens, which could host up to 200 events a year when a new \u0026pound25 million arena is completed.  The association accused council chiefs of trying to commercialise \u0026ldquoevery square metre of the city centre.  Only the festival fireworks finale would be allowed in the gardens under the Cockburn\u0026rsquos vision for the beauty spot.  Chairman Cliff Hague said: \u0026ldquoLike many others, my concerns have grown, as it seems like every square metre of the city centre is being viewed as a means of raising revenue. This also links disruption such events cause before, during and after the event itself.  \u0026ldquoI have no problems with the fireworks at the end of the festival, which depend on the setting of the castle to add to the spectacle.  \u0026ldquoBut I am less convinced by the necessity to stage major pop and rock concerts.

It comes as a music festival was told to take down a massive black-out fence blighting the city centre.

PHE wants to see smokers taking up the electronic devices to reduce the thousands of people dying from tobacco-related diseases every year.          E-cigarettes are estimated to be 95% less harmful than conventional cigarettes.

PHE\u0026rsquos findings were criticised at the time by some experts, saying they were based on poor quality evidence. They also pointed to links between some experts, the tobacco industry and firms that manufacture e-cigarettes.          Smoking is the leading cause of premature death in the UK \u0026amp is responsible for half of the health gap between the poorest and most affluent communities.

Some studies have linked vaping with lung damage, heart disease and even cancer and infant mortality.  Research by the University of Birmingham published this week said e-cigarette vapour has a similar effect on the lungs and body that is seen in regular cigarette smokers and patients with chronic lung disease.  A study by the New York University School of Medicine found smoke from e-cigarettes damages DNA and can increased the risk of cancer and heart disease in mice.  Meanwhile, researchers at the Geisel School of Medicine in the US have warned any kind of nicotine exposure during pregnancy, whether from smoking, skin patches or vaping, heightens the chances of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Many experts say much more research needs to be done in the area.  \u0026ndash Can they encourage people to smoke conventional cigarettes?  The STC says concerns that e-cigarettes could be a gateway to conventional smoking, including for young non-smokers, \u0026ldquohave not materialised.  Expert opinion on the issue is divided.  In the UK a person must be 18 to buy e-cigarettes or the e-liquids they vaporise.  The latest data from the Office for National Statistics suggests young people are smoking in fewer numbers, with the number of 18 to 24-year-olds who smoke falling eight percentage points since 2011.  However a 2017 study of 14 and 15-year-olds from 20 English schools found a \u0026ldquorobust association between vaping and a higher probability of cigarette smoking."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8261604.jpg?type=article-full","title":"council-offers-free-sanitary-products-in-public-buildings","story":"  Women in North Ayrshire will be able to access the products from vending machines in the toilets of up to 100 buildings such as libraries, community centres and public offices.  The council said it is the first local authority in the UK to offer free sanitary provision in all of its public buildings.  It comes after the local authority introduced free sanitary products in its secondary schools last August, with young women accessing more than 13,000 free sanitary towels and tampons while at school in the last year.    Council leader Joe Cullinane said: \"Sanitary products are a necessity, not a choice. I wish for no women or girl here in North Ayrshire to find themselves in the embarrassing and often degrading situation of having to use improper sanitary protection simply because they cannot afford it.  \"After all, periods are not exempt from poverty - they don\u0027t take account of what is in your pocket or purse. Therefore, it is absolutely right that we should look at ways in which to tackle this gendered inequality.  \"This latest announcement in our period poverty programme aims to help address the issue and make period poverty history in North Ayrshire.\"  A study published by girls\u0027 rights charity Plan International UK earlier this year found that 45% of those living in Scotland said they have been forced to use makeshift sanitary wear including socks or newspapers because they have struggled to buy products.  The Scottish Government is rolling out a project to provide free sanitary products to women from low-income households across Scotland following a pilot scheme in Aberdeen, while free sanitary products will also be available to those at school, college or university from this month.  Scottish Labour MSP Monica Lennon, who is bringing forward a Member\u0027s Bill to create a statutory duty for free provision of sanitary products, welcomed the scheme in North Ayrshire.  She said: \"Councillor Cullinane and North Ayrshire Council are leading the way on ending period poverty.  \"Access to sanitary products should be a right, regardless of your income, which is why I am moving ahead with plans for legislation to introduce a universal system of free access to sanitary products for everyone in Scotland.  \"I\u0027m delighted that North Ayrshire will extend free sanitary product provision to all of its public buildings and I hope other organisations will follow their lead.  \"No-one should face the indignity of being unable to access these essential products to manage their period.\""},{"url":null,"title":"uk-can-survive-and-prosper-after-no-deal-brexit-jeremy-hunt","story":"  The Foreign Secretary said that failure to hammer out a deal with the UK would be \u0026ldquoa big mistake for Europe.

But its creation was the brainchild of Krakow-born Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division, who was stationed in Galashiels during the war and married a Scottish nurse in 1942 after being treated in the town’s Peel Hospital.He became a successful hotelier in Edinburgh after the war and added Barony Castle in Eddleston to his properties in 1968, where the map was conceived and created.He wanted to show hotel guests the landscape of Scotland and hoped the map would become a tourist magnet.Jan also wanted to show the coastline of the country Polish forces had been responsible for defending.                                                                                                        He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Friday 17 Aug 2018 4:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117108.jpg","title":"Dont be put off if youre being bullied employees are told after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau (CAB), stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Friday 17 Aug 2018 4:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116895.jpg","title":"Gala furore over Lidl Wayne absolutely ridiculous","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMany people took to social media to voice their anger and concern at the reaction and coverage in the national and regional press following the appearance of the character on Saturday night.Around 90 per cent of the responses were positive and supportive.

This will also improve the availability of recycled material for use in the production of bottles and cans in future.“I would encourage everyone with an interest to provide their views on how this scheme can meet Scotland’s needs and help us tackle our throwaway culture.”Iain Gulland, Chief Executive, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “Scotland’s planned deposit return scheme is a landmark in the nation’s circular economy journey, with the potential to drive inward investment and create jobs in Scotland at the same time as improving recycling and reducing litter.\u0026#8221Consultation available to view.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They were both originally earmarked for closure, but were later given temporary reprieves to see if customer numbers increase.The new report also warned that while \"online banking, Post Office banking and mobile bank vans go some way to providing alternatives\", there were concerns over cyber security, \"the fragile nature of Post Office contracts\", and accessibility of mobile banks.Zoe Laird, HIE\u0026rsquos regional head of communities infrastructure, said: \"Along with the findings of the Scottish Parliament Enquiry into bank closures this [study] will inform how public sector agencies and service providers respond.\"Friday 17 Aug 2018 4:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Even non-dog owners have praised our initiative.\"She added: \"This is a disappointing thing to happen in our village where so many volunteers do their best to maintain the area to ensure this is a clean and safe place for residents and visitors and I am appalled that this vandalism was apparently carried out by a local resident.\"The community council and Men\u0026rsquos Shed group were put in touch via link man Roddie McPherson, who lives near the fishing village\u0026rsquos landmark harbour.The eco-friendly wooden dispensers can be found at the Avoch end of the railway line path, on Shore Walk by the industrial units, at the harbour green and at the start of the Shaltie Burn path.The move follows a recent initiative in the village to highlight the many paths which can be enjoyed by visitors to the village via a panel erected at a prominent spot near the Lazy Corner.A police spokesman said: \"Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101, quoting NE5003/18, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.\"Friday 17 Aug 2018 4:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The opening of this section opens up the South Loch Ness Trail to more walkers, mountain bikers and horse riders and, particularly on this section of the trail, to those of limited mobility.\"Mr Ambrose added that the creation of the LochNess360\u0026deg trail will bring new opportunities for businesses, communities and deliver major economic benefit to the area in the long term.\"It will achieve this because it will attract visitors who may spend up to six to seven days completing the full circuit,\" he added. We know from feedback that there is already substantial interest from key European markets, particularly Germany, and VILN hope by spring 2019 to confidently go out to markets and promote it.

I said you can\u0026rsquot do that \u0026ndash no one has been notified about this. The guys just said they were acting on instructions.\"Hamish Mackenzie of Tarbat Community Council wrote to Highland Council chief executive Steve Barron back in June after receiving apologies in January from local authority community services staff for the lack of warning.They said the equipment was removed on health and safety grounds \u0026ndash a reason given in other similar instances across the region.However Mr Mackenzie says follow-up enquiries for details about land ownership and the legalities of the situation have not been responded to months later.\"The first choice is to get Highland Council to continue to maintain the park in accordance with the original agreement. People certainly feel short-changed by the council.\"People are also aware of things like threats to toilet provision and grass not being mowed. We seem to have an endless series of services being cut, often without any notice.\"He added: \"I understand budget pressures but we will fight when things are taken away without any warning, particularly when we see no justification for it.\"He said the developer of the Knockshortie Estate, Micky Austin was \"staggered\" to learn of the latest development having paid \u0026pound18,000 towards the cost of the playpark, which he had assumed would continue to be maintained and available to locals. He said: \"He is a public spirited person and has developed a nice estate. A play park lets children to get outside and away from gadgets and devices. It\u0026rsquos a great tragedy.\"\u0026nbspQuestion marks though remain for the community over the legality of the move. Many on the estate feel cheated that a facility which helped attract them in the first place has been stripped away \u0026ndash while others say Highland Council has \"played the health and safety card\" without justification.\u0026nbspThey are now left seeking answers and facing the prospect of potentially having to raise thousands to replace the facility.Tain and Easter Ross councillor Derek Loudon said: \"Highland Council officers have ordered a search of the Land Register and the Register of Sasines to clarify ownership. \"This will allow what is a very pro-active community to acquire or lease the land for a lottery or other funding bid. That is a prerequisite for any lottery bid. Let\u0026rsquos hope the community gets a quick turnaround and are able to buy the equipment needed and get it ready for next summer.\"Highland Council was approached for comment but had not responded as we went to press.Friday 17 Aug 2018 4:41 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

All my sculptures contain a memory and I felt it apt that this particular work should be imbued with the feeling of being held in a loving embrace, feeling safe and secure enough to develop your potential.\"The Shelter of Your Arms is one of a collection of pieces created by Ann on display throughout the garden and in the Sawyer Gallery within Inverewe House.Operations manager Kevin Frediani said: \"As a result of the Gulf Stream meeting the Highlands, Inverewe Garden is a nirvana of unusual and wonderful plants and wildlife. Through our arts and exhibition programme we are providing visitors with another dimension to the garden and new way to enjoy Scotland\u0026rsquos national and natural treasures, as our reputation as a centre of arts and culture grows.\"The exhibition is open now and runs until August 30.Last month, NTS unveiled its vision of a proposed new 20m viewing tower within the garden.The plans, which have been submitted to Highland Council for consent, would see an observation tower overlooking Loch Ewe.If given the go-ahead, the tower would provide unique panoramic views for visitors with, according to the NTS, minimal impact on surroundings and could be used to host educational talks.A spring 2019 opening is planned if all goes according to plan.The attraction has enjoyed a surge in visitor numbers after recent investment including the renovation of Inverewe House, the development of the new Sawyer Gallery and Bothy Caf\u0026eacute and new glasshouses.Friday 17 Aug 2018 4:41 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We wanted to take positive action to help the red squirrel population spread into the local woodlands as safely as possible. The combination of bridge and road signs definitely appears to be working well, which is great news.\"It\u0026rsquos safer for reds to travel in the tree canopy rather than on the ground, so it\u0026rsquos likely that if they have the option of using a bridge rather than crossing the road, they will take it. We also installed feeders at each end of the bridge to encourage the squirrels to use it.\"Since the bridge and road signs were introduced, there has only been one known red squirrel road death locally, with none reported so far in 2018. The year before, there were three reported road deaths of reds in the immediate area and two others further away.The rope bridge is suspended over the A896 outside Shieldaig village, alongside the Ben Shieldaig woodland, one of Scotland\u0026rsquos few remaining fragments of ancient Caledonian forest.Local climber Chris Hingley worked with Becky to install the bridge last June 2017, with support from Highland Council.

We will keep residents informed once a proposed timescale for this work to take place has been identified in consultation with Highland Council.\"On health concerns, he said the water supply across Scotland is sampled, on average, once every two minutes and tested against strict quality standards to protect public health.

Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday.

And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"wait is over as texts arrive with exam results ","story":"\nThose who chose to receive the news by text or email will have woken up to their results this morning while for those awaiting the traditional method will have to wait for an envelope falling through the letterbox.\nShetland pupils have performed strongly, though in some areas the number of passes were down on last year.\nPass rates for National 4 were 94 per cent, down from 96 per cent in 2017.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"various apprenticeships ","story":" Radar Technician – SERCO – Unst\nApprenticeship vacancies are open to male and female applicants, candidates over age 25 will be considered for some vacancies.\nWages vary dependent on employer.

Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nFriday 17 Aug 2018 4:41 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116807.jpg","title":"Dont play mother to lost wildcat kittens","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nThe public is being urged to be hands off if they spot a possible Scottish Wildcat kitten in the wilds of Strathspey unless they are certain it is in immediate danger.\nExperts have issued the warning after a well-meaning member of the public removed possible kittens from the wild and their mother.\nRare wildcats \u0026ndash and other cats in the countryside \u0026ndash are now at an age when they are out and about, even without their mums.\nScottish Wildcat Action Project Officer Emma Rawling said: \"If anyone sees tabby kittens alone in a possible wildcat area and or if mother looks like a wildcat, the public should be cautious and assume they could be wildcat kittens.\n\"Wildcats are protected by law.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

He has spent all of his life as a politicalactivist.\nBut helooks, and interacts socially, like someone much younger.\nBeforehe came to Ireland he inquired about the current ages of my own children.\nI jokedthat as they were getting older I was getting younger!\nHereplied that of course I’d be getting younger, because ‘The struggle keeps usall alert and in fine fettle.\nI firstbecame aware of Ronnie Kasrils in 1992 when the march on Bisho occurred duringthe phase of mass action in South Africa.\nHe wasinterviewed on international news as one of the key leaders and was veryarticulate.\nTheSouth African national liberation struggle was at a decisive period. Historywas clearly being made.\nSomeyears later in 2004 as Sinn Féin\u0027s Northern Chairperson Iproposed we invite an ANC representative to Ireland as part of the Cúige’s Céad (centenary) celebrations.\nThe Cúigeleadership agreed.\nBy thenRonnie Kasrils was the South African Minister of Intelligence.\nSo Ichanced my arm and sent off a letter more in vain hope than any realexpectation.\nRemarkablyRonnie wrote back accepting our invitation to visit Ireland, and, would do soas a representative of Thabo Mbeki’s government.\nNeedlessto say we were delighted (and, the Cúige had just been saved a fortune of moneyin plane fares!)\nAtremendously successful programme of events was organised and Ronnie Kasrilshad a big impact everywhere he visited and spoke.\nHe andother South African comrades returned the following year to share the ANC’sexperience of transition in government as we launched the big debate within therepublican base on policing.\nVerymany comrades have vivid memories of Ronnie’s contribution to our internalpolitical discussions during this period.\nHe alsoattended and addressed Ard Fheiseanna with his then wife Eleanor and thenafter her untimely death in 2009 he wrote a brilliant book about her own rolein the liberation struggle entitled the ‘Unlikley Secret Agent’.\nHislatest book ‘A Simple Man’ is a compelling critique of current day SouthAfrica.\nRonniewas a senior figure in the collective leadership of the ANC MK, or Unkhonto weSizwe (Spear of the Nation) and the South African Communist Party, as well asa Deputy Minister of Defence, and later Minister of Intelligence in SouthAfrica.\nThe newbook provides an analysis of the ANC’s transition from resistance to powerwhich is essential reading for all political activists.\nJoeSlovo, the former MK Chief of Staff, said to Ronnie Kasrils towards the end of1994 that very few people had enjoyed the unique privilege of serving in aliberation struggle and then in government as they had.\nAs acommitted internationalist he has consistently stood in support of the peopleof Palestine, Cuba and freedom loving people across the world.\nHe hasmade an important contribution to the Basque peace process.\nAlongwith others in South Africa he has strongly supported the Irish peace process,and Sinn Féin’s work to achieve an agreed, united Ireland.\nDuringtwo speaking engagements in Belfast and Derry he kept the audiences enthralledwith his political analysis. They reciprocated with standing ovations.\nIn theGasyard centre in Derry’s Bogside he raised the roof with a funny story ofmeeting Ché Guevara in Dar-es-Salaam where he said therevolutionary icon gave a speech on armed struggle in Africa which was “bollocks”!!!\nWe helda very dignified wreath laying ceremony at Martin McGuinness’ grave, duringwhich Ronnie spoke very emotionally of Martin’s legacy, before giving amilitary salute as one freedom fighter to another.\n\nIn aseparate moment towards the end of his stay he said to me warmly: “You’ve gotthe right strategy you’ve got the right politics. The humanity of your peopleand their commitment is so tremendous.\nWe allneed to be able to draw inspiration from history, past sacrifice, leadershipand determination.\nHeroworship is something altogether different. That’s the stuff of sycophancy andthe notion that the celebration of personality is the end itself.\nThephrase that “we stand on the shoulders of giants” refers to those who have gonebefore us, but left a legacy of inspiration and leadership by example.\nThisSunday the National Hunger Strike commemoration will take place inCastlewellan, County Down.\n\nTheIrish Hunger strikers are now among a pantheon of iconic Irish andinternational figures who symbolise the struggle for a better world alongsidethe leaders of 1916 Mary Ann McCracken Nelson Mandela Ché Guevaraand Ho Chi Minh.\nBertoltBrecht the socialist poet wrote:\n      “There are those who struggle for a day and that is good\n                There are those whostruggle for a year and that is better\n                And there are those who struggle for twenty tears and that is better still\n  Then there are thosewho struggle all their lives, and they are the ones we cannot do without”\nRonnieKasrils continues to politically campaign enthusiastically for a better worldeven while approaching the autumn of his life.\nThestruggle for Irish unity, independence, and an Ireland of equals has beenenriched by his friendship and solidarity.\nSinn Féin and other progressives inIreland are proud to call him our comrade and our friend.    \n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27434  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\n“The vibrant, colourful and loud message from today’s Belfast Pride parade is that the ‘north is next’ and Sinn Féin will continue to campaign to ensure that this becomes a reality.” - Megan Fearon MLA\nSinn Féin joined thousands of people on the streets of Belfast today for the annual Belfast Pride finale in solidarity with the LGBTQ community. \nThe parade – led by the Belfast Pride Festival and Mayor of Belfast Deirdre Hargey – started at Custom House Square, made its way past City Hall and through Belfast City Centre. \n\nColourful banners and floats from businesses, community organisations, political parties, emergency services and campaign groups such as Love Equality joined the procession. \nThere was a clear message from today’s parade, there is a demand for equality for the LGBTQ+ community twinned with mass opposition to the DUP’s denial of marriage equality. \n, Sinn Féin Equality spokesperson, Megan Fearon MLA said pride is a display of ‘unity and determination’ to achieve equality. \n“It’s really important that we are all together here today to fight for equality of opportunity under the law. \n“Equality for all our citizens, but especially for our LGBTQ+ brothers and sisters.

The party’s spokesperson for Business, Enterprise andInnovation Maurice Quinlivan TD has announced proposals to increase the numberof people in apprenticeships to 60,000 by 2023, whilst also branding thecurrent government’s reform plans as “unambitious, uninspiring and unacceptablyslow”.\nThe document outlines Sinn Féin’s proposals to reform the system in ways suchas trebling the number of apprenticeship programmes currently availablealongside focusing on plans to increase the female \u0026amp people withdisabilities participation rates within the programmes. \nDeputy Maurice Quinlivan said\n “Thegovernment is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming theapprenticeship system. In 2017 just 391 people took part in newly establishedapprenticeship programmes, compared to the government’s target of 800.\n “Inaddition, only nine of the promised fifteen new apprenticeship programmes wereintroduced last year.”\n SinnFéin has also outlined the benefits of an all-Ireland apprenticeship system andthe benefits that would come with including trade unions in the development andgovernance of the programmes. The document reiterates Sinn Féin’s aim toabolish student contribution fees for apprentices and details how the partywill promote apprenticeship programmes as another tertiary education choice.\n Apprenticeshipis a tried and proven way for employers to develop highly skilled workers fortheir company and industry by using a mixture of coursework and practical onthe job learning. Record numbers of students are attending third leveleducation, but with this route not being suitable for everyone, Sinn Féin wantsto create more alternative routes for young people.\nDeputyQuinlivan continued\n“AcrossIreland we lack significant alternative opportunities for young people topursue other education. We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries. We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018. In addition, the physically demanding nature of the current availableapprenticeships has resulted in just 1.7% of total apprentices in 2016 beingpeople with disabilities.\n\nSinnFéin aims to increase investment in apprenticeships to over €350 million perannum within five years. \nTheLimerick City TD, Deputy Quinlivan has said that this will “fund the treblingof the number apprenticeship programmes and provide places for 60,000apprentices”.\nDeputy Quinlivan continued: “€5,166,000 of investment will be required overfive years for the development of 63 new apprenticeship programmes, bringingthe total number of craft and new courses to 100.\n“Ireland’sallocation from the EU for training and education of the young is €68 million.Fine Gael was forced to return €19.8 million of this allocation in 2016, asthey failed to submit a payment application.\n“SinnFéin will ensure all EU monies allocated to Ireland would be fully utilised, tobenefit the education and training of our young people.

The attack on the marchers was carried out in front of the news cameras, brining global attention to the civil rights campaign and the the discrimination of the unionist regime at Stormont. \n\nThis Saturday\u0027s march, organised by Sinn Féin, is the first in a series of events planned to mark the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the civil rights campaign. \nMid Ulster Sinn Féin MP, Francie Molloy, who helped organise and took part in the original parade 50 years ago, said that the campaign for rights is as relevant now as it was in 1968 and encouraged people to take part in Saturday\u0027s march. \n\"Presently, with the deliberate denial of rights, a shortage of affordable housing and the ongoing issue of constituency boundary proposals, it is clear there is still a job of work to be done,\" he said. \nWith the DUP\u0027s denial of rights to the LGB\u0026ampT community, Irish language speakers and bereaved families awaiting inquests, it is clear the campaign for rights needs to continue in the north. The onset of the Tory Brexit, backed by the DUP, also represents an attack on the rights of people in the north. \nThe main speaker at the end of the commemoration at the Square in Dungannon will be former Sinn Féin MLA Mitchel McLaughlin. \nSpeaking ahead of Saturday\u0027s march, the former Northern Assembly Speaker called for a huge turnout. \"Let\u0027s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0027s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement,\" he said. \nThe parade will begin in Coalisland at 3pm on Saturday and make its way to Dungannon. \n\n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a05f-jpg.jpg","title":"65470  ","story":"    \nNORTHERN Ireland have been crowned World Champions after the local sailors took on the best from around the world for the Atlantic Challenge and won.\nTeams of young people from around the globe converged on Lough Neagh for the toughest test of endurance, strength and skill.\nThe Northern Ireland crew had an outstanding week in Antrim, with big wins in the two Jackstay Transfer tasks, traditional rope work, man overboard and the rowing slalom races.

Heart Foundation Northern Ireland (BHF NI).\n  \nMairead Agnew was inspired by her young neighbour Mark Lynn, who has complex congenital heart disease. At just 8 years old, he has undergone four open heart surgeries and numerous cardiac procedures. \n  \nIn 2015 Mark was diagnosed with heart failure but this still hasn’t stopped him and his parents Donna and Geoff supporting BHF NI and raising almost \u0026pound3,000 for the charity.\n  \nMairead explained: “My sister was born with congenital heart disease so this is a cause that has always been extremely close to mine and my family’s hearts. When I saw the wonderful fundraising that Mark and his family had raised, I wanted to do something to help. When I told Mark I was taking on the Berlin Marathon, he was sure he wanted us to support BHF NI once again.”\n  \nKaren McCammon, Health Services Engagement Lead for BHF NI explained: “When the BHF was founded in 1961, 8 out of every 10 babies born with congenital heart disease died before their first birthday. Our research has helped to turn this around, and now 8 out of 10 babies survive to adulthood. Breakthroughs such as these are only possible because of the support we receive from supporters like Mairead, Mark and his family. We are therefore extremely grateful for all their efforts.”\n  \nBHF have also developed pioneering surgical techniques to treat complex congenital defects. However, there is still much more work to be done. For children like Mark, who have complex congenital heart disease, treatment can be much more difficult.\n  \nMairead, Mark and his family are keen to raise as much awareness and funds as possible and are asking everyone to support in any way they can. You can donate to Mairead or Mark in person or call into any of the following businesses in Ballymena: The Moat Bar, Kockeden Lodge, Credit Union, Willy Allen’s Butchers, The Mace, Ballykeel Chemist, Molly Malone’s Chip Shop and A Star Valeting and Detailing, Ballymena who are running a special offer between August 16 and September 16 - offering full valets for just \u0026pound60 and \u0026pound70 for jeeps and 4x4\u0027s, \u0026pound2 of every full valet will be donated to the cause.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921264.jpg--.jpg?1534230306000\n","title":"plans to extend public realm scheme to greenvale street","story":"  \nPLANS are being considered to extend the Public Realm Scheme to Greenvale Street in Ballymena Town Centre.\n  \nHowever, one local business owner who has been based on the street for 20 years, has hit out at the lack of consultation around the proposals.\n  \nClaire Brennan of Oasis Hair Salon claims she has had to rely on “hearsay” in a bid to find out more about the plans.\n  \nNIE is currently carrying out utility works on the street which is expected to last four weeks.\n  \nClaire said: “I have heard that after the four weeks they are planning to rip the entire street up and replace it as part of the Public Realm Scheme. I understand that the work is expected to last right up until Christmas.\n  \n“My issue is firstly there has been no consultation, I don\u0027t know exactly what they are planning to do. \n  \n“We are relying on hearsay at the minute and I have heard that there are plans to lay stone similar to the rest of the town.” \n  \nClaire said she had written a letter to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council about the issue.\n  \nShe continued: “It took ten days to get a reply which said there was “nothing concrete at the minute”.\n  \nClaire said that among her concerns was that the area has a very slopping street which raises issues around what type of paving is used.\n  \nShe added: “Also there are concerns around water flowing down the street due to the slope and the fact that if the paving used is light in colour chewing gum, which will eventually cover it, will turn black and soon make the street look grubby and shabby.”\n  \nClaire said she would like to see either the street remain the same and be “brought back to its former glory” or be consulted on any proposed plans.\n  \n“We want to have a debate about it, not have to rely on hearsay.

Alan rounds off with some insights into the general history of dam-building in this country and relates how civil engineering has developed its own code of ethics over the 200 years since the foundation of the Institution of Civil Engineers.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921285.jpg--.jpg?1534232428000\n","title":"estelle in the frame for spectacle wearer of year win","story":"  \nA Ballymena woman has been chosen from thousands of proud glasses wearers as a finalist for Specsavers’ Spectacle Wearer of the Year.\n  \nEstelle Wallace, shortlisted in the 45 – 59 age category from Rasharkin could follow in the footsteps of last year’s Award winner, Love Island hunk Alex Miller, winning \u0026pound10,000 and the chance to mingle with the stars at the annual awards. \n  \nGlasses wearers across the UK and Republic of Ireland have been showing off their specs style by sharing their selfies online.\n  \nEstelle, who is a health and wellness coach, was invited to visit her local Specsavers store in Fairhill Shopping Centre to receive a bottle of champagne, a certificate and a \u0026pound125 glasses voucher.\n  \nEstelle said: “I was really delighted to be shortlisted as a regional finalist.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

Their actions made history but Dungannon’s pivotal role in the quest for social justice was soon forgotten as images of beaten and bloodied marchers on the Duke Street march that October grabbed headlines around the world.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nDungannon-born presenter Lynette Fay with Bernadette McAliskey during recording for Stories in Sound: In The Footsteps, due to be broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster this Sunday (August 19) at 12.30pm\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBorn in Dungannon only a decade later, presenter Lynette Fay had no idea that people she knew growing up – her brother’s primary school teacher, and her next door neighbours – were among the organisers of that first march.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn this Stories In Sound documentary for BBC Radio Ulster, she follows ‘In The Footsteps’ of those first civil rights marchers. She revisits the issue of housing discrimination and the ground breaking protests of the young mothers of the Homeless Citizens League, and learns first-hand about the organisation of the march from the so-called “Protestor Number One”. She hears from Bernadette McAliskey about how the march turned her into a lifelong campaigner, as well as from those who took part in a counter protest.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nUsing a blend of highly personal interviews and archive audio, Lynette asks what spurred them to take to the streets in pursuit of civil rights, whether or not they achieved their aims – and at what cost. Fifty years on from that first civil rights march, how has Dungannon – and Northern Ireland – changed?\n\nIn the Footsteps - presented by Lynette Fay and produced by Freya McClements – is broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster on Sunday, August 19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602191.1534343875!/image/image.jpg","title":"fundraising in memory of elizabeth","story":"\nElizabeth Adams was an employee of Mountvale Private Nursing Home, Dromore for over 11 years, she was a work colleague but mainly a friend.  \n\n                \nAfter a short illness called Sarcoidosis, she passed away peacefully on January 15.

Since its formation in 1994, the initiative has sent over 2000 students from Northern Ireland to all four corners of the United States where they have successfully completed a year studying\n\nJonathan Stewart, Director, British Council Northern Ireland, added: “I am confident that the students departing for the US this year will be great ambassadors for Northern Ireland and will help to further important long-term links and connections. A recent report published by the British Council has highlighted that the relationship between the US and the UK is driven as much by cultural factors, as political with programmes such as Study USA supporting these links and strengthening them for the future. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Through Study USA, students will have the opportunity to not only enhance their employability skills but also develop intercultural skills, which will help them to prepare to work in a global economy. We wish them success, and trust that new connections and friendships will be developed in the year ahead.”\n\nStudy USA is just one of many international opportunities available through British Council Northern Ireland.

In addition, the company has faced an extremely challenging retail trading environment reflecting weak consumer confidence and reduced consumer spending. These factors have had a significant adverse impact on Homebase’s trading position.\n\n“After a comprehensive review, Homebase has concluded that its current store portfolio mix is no longer viable. Rental costs associated with stores are unsustainable and many stores are loss making.\n\n“The CVA enables Homebase to make essential changes to its store portfolio, reducing its cost base and providing a stable platform on which to continue its turnaround.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Under the terms of the CVA proposal, all creditors receive a better outcome than any other likely alternative.\n\n“It is anticipated that 42 stores will close during late 2018 and early 2019.\n\n“The proposed changes to the store portfolio will regrettably mean redundancies from those stores earmarked for closure. The process is expected to lead to a reduction of up to 1,500 roles, although every effort will be made to redeploy team members within the business where possible.\n\n“All stores in the UK and the Republic of Ireland will remain open for business as usual and this process will have no impact on customer purchases, outstanding orders or any product or service guarantees.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The creditors will vote on the CVA on 31 August 2018.”\n\nDamian McGloughlin, CEO of Homebase, said: “Launching a CVA has been a difficult decision and one that we have not taken lightly. Homebase has been one of the most recognisable retail brands for almost 40 years, but the reality is we need to continue to take decisive action to address the underperformance of the business and deal with the burden of our cost base, as well as to protect thousands of jobs. The CVA is therefore an essential measure for the business to take and will enable us to refocus our operations and rebuild our offer for the years ahead.”\n\nStephanie Pollitt, Assistant Director of Real Estate Policy, British Property Federation (BPF), said: “These situations are never easy as property owners need to take into consideration the impact on their investors, including those protecting their investors’ pensioners’ savings, as they vote on the CVA proposal. Homebase and Alvarez \u0026amp Marsal have, however, demonstrated best practice, engaging with the BPF in the process and therefore ensuring property owners’ interests have been properly taken into account. Ultimately, it will be for individual property owners to decide how they will vote on the CVA, but the proposal has sought to find a solution that provides a sustainable future for Homebase.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8478809.1533901811!/image/image.jpg","title":"was speeding in hurry to get to work","story":"\nIn a hurry to get to work a 49-year-old man broke the speed limit in his van, Craigavon Magistrates Court heard last Wednesday.\n\n                \nAsen Asenov, whose address was given as Flush Place, Lurgan, was fined £75 for excess speed on May 30 this year.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThree penalty points were also imposed and he was ordered to pay a £15 offender’s levy.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFor having a defective light on his vehicle he was fined £50.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe court heard that at 11.30pm on the Portadown Road in Lurgan police saw a Mercedes Sprinter van with a Bulgarian registration travelling in excess of the 40mph speed limit.\n\nThey followed the van for a distance of over half a mile and to keep up they were doing between 60mph and 65mph.\n\nPolice also noticed that the right rear side light was not working.\n\nThrough an interpreter Asenov said he had been rushing that day.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe explained that he had already received a warning about his job and he didn’t want to be late.

As the years went on they became less and less involved, but they were still on our board of directors for a number of years.\n“As time went on we became more secular and we didn’t have that relationship with the Church anymore. But we’re still very grateful for them for setting it up and for identifying the huge need for counselling and support in this area, I suppose because Ardoyne was hit so hard by the conflict.\n“The Passionists worked tirelessly, and I remember sister Kathleen constantly bringing funders into a room and saying ‘You have got to fund this.’ Because there was very little funding in the early days she worked extremely hard to get us established, funded and working.\n“We have grown considerably, and we now deliver about 12,000 to 13,000 sessions a year to about 2,500 people. As well as operating from this site, we also work in a range of local schools and community venues. If someone wants to be seen or needs help somewhere else we can do that too.”\nNorma continued: “Our clinical practice is excellent. We have just been awarded BACP [British Association for Counselling and Psycho-therapy) accreditation for our services. Most counsellors are individually accredited by the BACP, but very few organisations carry the accreditation. We are one of only six in Northern Ireland to be accredited this year.”\nWith a degree in psychology and a professional background in both therapy and conflict resolution, Norma said that New Life felt like a place where she could make a difference.\nIn the past, she has worked at New Life as a sessional counsellor and her experience in play therapy has allowed her to help children and adults alike. New Life is one of the few organisations in the north that offers child and family therapy – services that Norma insists are vital for North Belfast.\n“I think in this area you are working with generations of people who have had things really difficult,” she said.\n“Personal safety was at risk throughout the Troubles and the area has grown up with generations and generations of high unemployment. Poverty, conflict and trauma have a huge impact, not just psychologically, but on a cellular level it impacts people physically.\n“Poverty also has a huge impact on children’s education and a number of different things, so we’re working with multiple issues for a lot of families and they are trying really hard to overcome those things. It has a massive impact on people’s self-esteem, so it’s almost a vicious cycle.”\nShe continued: “There is a lot of research that has come out recently into adverse experience in childhood and the impact that those have on physical health, mental health, and educational achievement. The aim is to try to tackle things early. I think that’s why we believe that child therapy is so important, because you’ve got to be working with children from an early age to begin to address their issues early on.\n“If you don’t catch certain things in childhood, sometimes you’re working with very difficult teenage years because it’s harder to intervene. Sometimes those teenagers will come back as adults and they will feel like they are ready to tackle the issue at that stage.\n“At any stage in life it’s encouraging to know that anything can be repaired. Our brains are wonderful organs and in many ways they have a great plasticity so you can address those issues, you just have to be motivated and have the right motivator to identify what that change might look like.\n“Not everybody needs counselling, sometimes a friend or a colleague or anyone you can connect with can transform things for you. Talking to anybody helps you and can help you, but counselling gives a framework and a focus for those who need it.\n“If you can catch people before they hit the crisis it’s much better. When you’re in a crisis your ability to think clearly, to support yourself or to act lessens, so it’s much harder to activate the changes you need. If you can get into counselling when you’re not in crisis then you’ll be able to change things more quickly, but counselling can really help. It helps you to clear your mind enough to realise what needs to happen next to take you out of crisis.”\nWhile New Life has come on leaps and bounds since it began, offering thousands of yearly counselling sessions, Norma admits that mental health charities, including New Life, need more support to effectively help those in need of support.\n“I think pre-Troubles we didn’t have nearly enough mental health services,” she said.\n“People were just in lockdown mode, they were just surviving. Since the peace process there has been a lot more services established. I think mental health services are still desperately underfunded in Northern Ireland given what we have come through.\n“For our service we have a six-month waiting list and sometimes it can go up to a year. If you need a counsellor it’s way too long to wait, but we don’t have the funding to deliver any more sessions than we currently do.\n“I think there needs to be more accessible services. People get fed up sitting on a waiting list and a lot can happen in that space of time.”\nShe concluded: “If you do need someone to talk to it’s important that you come forward. Young people, especially can access our services quite quickly so we would really encourage them to come forward.”\nIf you think you might benefit from talking to New Life, call 90 391630.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tribute call for elisha scott","story":"\n\nTHE\n public vote to name the new road leading to the Olympia Leisure Centre in Belfast is in its final week and SDLP Councillor Donal Lyons is encouraging people to ensure they have their say and to vote for \u0026#8216Elisha Scott Boulevard\u0026#8217.\n\nElisha Scott is a Liverpool football legend and was Belfast Celtic’s most successful manager who also took the club on their tour of the US in 1949 where they defeated the then British champions, Scotland.\n\nCllr Donal Lyons said: “The vote to name this new road closes on this Sunday and the 125th anniversary of Elisha Scott’s birth will be on the 24th of this month, just days after. \n\n“I’m glad that my proposal to name this road after Elisha Scott has been included because despite Elisha being one of the most successful footballers to have come from our city, awareness of his achievements has faded. \n\n“It’s my hope, that by naming this road after Elisha Scott that we can correct this and begin to give him the full and long overdue recognition he deserves.”\n\nGoalkeeper Scott was born just yards from this new road. Cllr Lyons said it It would be fitting if the road was named after one of Belfast’s greatest ever footballers.\n\n“After famously signing for Liverpool FC in 1912 for ‘£1 and the price of the boat trip’, Scott would be a key player in Anfield for an incredible 22 years, making 468 first-team appearances. He holds the record as Liverpool’s longest serving player to this day. The earliest recorded football chant was Liverpool fans cheering his name. Scott is widely considered the first King of the Kop. \n\n“But it’s not just his time in Liverpool that’s worthy of celebrating. Elisha returned to the Donegall Road in 1934 to become player-manager for Belfast Celtic. Over the following 14 years, he would secure 31 trophies with the Grand Old Team, including 10 Irish League titles, six Irish Cups and eight Gold Cups. Belfast Celtic were the powerhouse in local football and the club still retains a loyal and dedicated fan base. \n\n“Scott also knew what mattered in football and when challenged amid worsening sectarian tensions in the 1930s, for fielding a cross community team he responded in his trademark forthright style, ‘I don’t play Protestant players. I don’t play Catholic players. I play good players.’ Scott’s success as both player and manager secured his place in history but his dedication to his club, players and fans ensured his place as a legend of the game.”\n\nYou can vote online at https://dof.belfastcity.gov.uk/NameTheRoadVote/  or by emailing NameTheRoad@BelfastCity.gov.uk with Elisha Scott in the subject and including your name and address.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"75m rooftop running track plan for old belfast","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast gridlock economically damaging for city have you been affected","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

You\u0027re not going to have cruise ships sending tour buses to Titanic if it means that people are getting stuck in traffic and don\u0027t make it back for the time they were meant to leave,\" she said.\n\n\"All of these things have an economic impact. Not everybody who drives in the Titanic Quarter is a commuter, some is necessary business traffic, there are haulage firms, and lorries who are caught up in this.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour.

He was also found to have breached rules on paid advocacy after lobbying then Prime Minister David Cameron on a UN resolution concerning human rights abuses in Sri Lanka.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC\u0027s Talkback, presenter William Crawley asked if he was considering resigning his position. \n\nHe responded: \"I have been very quiet about this since my apology in the House of Commons  - I have let that stand.\n\n\"The electors in North Antrim are now being petitioned.\n\n\"If I believed I had done anything that deserved me to resign my job I would not be there today - I think that answers the question.\"\n\nMr Paisley contacted the programme to talk about the benefits of road racing. It sparked a discussion after a lifelong bike fan, writing in Friday\u0027s Belfast  voiced his second thoughts on the sport given the recent tragedies.\n\n\n \nLifelong bikes fan\u0027s second thoughts about road racing after years of tragedy\n \n\n\nMr Paisley said he did not want to mix the worlds or sport and politics and said he would be prepared to do a full interview once the petition had closed.\n\nHe was asked if accepted he brought the House of Commons into disrepute - as the report authors stated. \n\n\n \nIan Paisley - full report from Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards\n \n\n\nWatch: Ian Paisley: Statement to House of Commons after standards report [full speech]\n \n\n\nHe added: \"I have accepted the report from the House of Commons and apologised for it... and accepted the punishment and I think everyone knows that.\"\n\nWhen it was put to him it was not like him to run away from a question he said he did not want to say anything that would \"influence\" what was going on with the petition.\n\nMr Paisley has also been suspended by the DUP pending an internal investigation.\n\nIf 7,543 people sign the recall petition, 10% of the electorate, then a by-election will be held.\n\nThe petition, which is due to run until September 19, is the first of its kind in UK parliamentary history.\n\nMr Paisley\u0027s 30-sitting day suspension from the House of Commons begins on September 4, when MPs return to Westminster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Paisley family at home in 1988.

that the Government would consider EU proposals that demanded accepting European environmental and social legislation, in order to facilitate a free trade agreement.\n\nThe comments came in an interview with ITV News after a meeting with the Dutch foreign minister as part of a three-day tour of Northern Europe.\n\nWhen asked whether he was presenting the Government’s Brexit plan as “take it or leave it”, Mr Hunt answered: “No, but it is a framework on which I believe the ultimate deal will be based and I’ve been to several countries and met seven foreign ministers and am meeting more in the weeks ahead and I’m getting a strong sense that not just in Holland but in many of the places I’ve visited that they do want to engage seriously to try and find a way through to try and get a pragmatic outcome.”\n\n\n\nIt (no-deal Brexit) would be a mistake we would regret for generations, if we had a messy, ugly divorce and would inevitably change British attitudes towards Europe\nJeremy Hunt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked if the UK would make concessions regarding environmental and social legislation, Mr Hunt responded: “I think we have to see what their proposal was, some of those things can have an impact on the level playing field, some won’t.”\n\nDiscussing the risk of no proper negotiated deal he said: “It would be a mistake we would regret for generations, if we had a messy, ugly divorce and would inevitably change British attitudes towards Europe.”\n\nAsked to compare himself with Boris Johnson’s approach as foreign secretary he said: “I think the role of the foreign secretary is to go around foreign capitals and point out the implications of not getting a deal are profound in terms of our friendship and corporation with foreign countries across a whole range of areas.”\n\nMr Hunt went on to respond to reports that Brussels Brexit negotiators were concerned they were being bugged by British spies.\n\nOfficials had raised security concerns after the UK obtained sensitive documents “within hours” of them being discussed, according to the Daily .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Hunt is touring northern Europe (David Cheskin/PA)\n\n\n\n\nSabine Weyand, the EU’s deputy chief Brexit negotiator, reportedly told officials at a European Council working party on exit talks that “it could not be excluded” that British intelligence had penetrated their meetings.\n\nMr Hunt, when asked about the rumours, said: “I’m Foreign Secretary and foreign secretaries never comment on such matters but you are a journalist and you don’t have any trouble finding out what is going on in those meeting just like you have no problems in finding out what’s happening in our London meetings.”\n\nA European Commission spokesman told journalists in Brussels at a regular briefing: “The commission’s position today is that we cannot comment on this press report.”\n\nIt comes as Brexit talks resumed in Brussels between UK and EU officials.\n\nBrexit Secretary Dominic Raab and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier are not involved in the latest round of discussions, which are focused on the Irish border and future relations, and are due to finish on Friday.\n\nThe spokesman said: “As this week’s round is at technical level there won’t be a meeting between Michel Barnier and Dominic Raab.\n\n“We will confirm in due course whether a subsequent meeting has been arranged.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"local government commissioner to hold hearing into complaint against uup veteran rodgers","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo

He\u0027s been in the industry for 30 years and has worked in venues from Andersonstown Leisure Centre to Wembley Stadium.\n\n\"This is just another day at the office,\" he said. \n\n\"It doesn\u0027t matter whether it\u0027s in a leisure centre, the SSE Arena, here or in Wembley Stadium, all I\u0027m doing is putting the same facilities together, using the same people.\n\n\"I\u0027ve put a schedule together and worked it all out so we all know what to do and when it\u0027s going to be done.\"\n\nWhat is clear is that it\u0027s a collaborative effort from all members of staff at the IFA. From ground staff to directors, employees have had to adapt to changeable surroundings.\n\nThomas Fulton is the ICT project manager and usually works in a team of two at the stadium. Sub-contractors have been brought in to cope with technical demands.\n\n\"We\u0027ve had to put temporary scanning into two corners of the pitch, which adds a little more pressure to my job,\" he said. \n\n\"We\u0027ve also put in a wireless network to monitor how many people are moving on and off the pitch, while having visibility of how many people are coming through our turnstiles.\"\n\nDirector of sales and marketing Simon Fitzpatrick added that the increase in visitor numbers will be beneficial to the future of the stadium and to local football.\n\n\"This gives us an opportunity to showcase the stadium for future events,\" he said. \n\nIn a night that\u0027s set to place Belfast back on the boxing map, everyone at Windsor Park is hoping the dedication and hard work has been worth it. \n\nIt\u0027s now over to you, Carl.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

other religious and civic leaders in Dublin Castle on August 25 for a reception set to be attended by Pope Francis and Taioseach Leo Varadkar.\n\n\n \nDancer dazzled by invite to perform at papal concert\n \n\n\nIt is understood that the Catholic Primate of Ireland, Archbishop Eamonn Martin, will introduce the Moderator and other church leaders to the Pope.\n\nLater on, Dr McMullen and his wife Barbara will attend a concert at Croke Park, at the invitation of Archbishop Martin.\n\nPope Francis will be the chief guest at the concert which will feature 2,000 performers, including singers Andrea Bocelli, Daniel O\u0027Donnell, Nathan Carter, and the Riverdance act.\n\nNorthern Ireland will be represented by The Priests and world famous flautist Sir James Galway.\n\nThe Croke Park concert will end a busy week for the Presbyterian Moderator and his wife who will return to Belfast next Tuesday from an official church visit to Jordan.\n\nSpeaking from the Middle East yesterday, Dr McMullen said: \"As a Church we recognised that this Papal visit would bring great joy to our Roman Catholic neighbours and friends, and it was something we wanted to welcome.\n\n\"I am pleased that our church has been able to accept the invitation to the reception and I am looking forward to it.\n\n\"Should there be an opportunity to meet Pope Francis I would very much welcome that in the context of building good relations.\"\n\nThe Presbyterian Clerk, Rev Trevor Gribben, told the Belfast  last night that there was a broad consensus to welcome the Pope.\n\n\"We are a large church and there will be people who believe sincerely that this would be a step too far, on theological grounds,\" he said.\n\n\"A small number of people on our General Council made this point, but did so graciously.\"\n\nThe Presbyterian Church did not send its Moderator to meet Pope John Paul II during his visit to the Republic in 1979, but the Assembly Clerk Dr Jack Weir personally attended a Papal reception in Dublin.\n\nDuring the UK visit by Pope Benedict in 2010 the Moderator Dr Norman Hamilton attended an ecumenical service involving the Pope in Westminster Abbey, but did not attend a reception afterwards to meet him.\n\nHowever, Presbyterian Secretary Dr Donald Watts met the Pope during his visit to Scotland during that tour.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed top 10 baby names

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch belfast gridlock drivers vent frustration at lengthy delays","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass. Extra bus and rail services will be provided by Translink for people travelling from Northern Ireland to Dublin for the visit.\n\nBuses will be run across both days by Translink, with additional services from Belfast, Banbridge, Newry and Londonderry for the Saturday. \n\nOn the Sunday, as well as the destinations listed, additional services will run from Larne, Dungannon, Downpatrick, Limavady, Dungiven, Magherafelt and Newtownards. Additional rail services will also run across both days.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"12 single square metres of land on earth that people would like","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nIn the clip, writer and composer Aaron Alon breaks down the maddening inconsistency of English vowel pronunciations, and entertainingly re-imagines it as a phonetically-consistent language. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe seemingly tongue-twisting video took the 37-year-old American around three days to make and has gone viral, with hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube and a huge reception on Reddit.\n\n“My creative work is often inspired by interesting questions and hypotheticals,” Aaron told the Press Association. \n\n“The greatest difficulty in making the video, outside of remembering how to speak normally again, was probably that I aimed to make this with a zero-dollar budget.” \n\n\n\nComment\n from discussion \nbig_american_tts’s comment from discussion \"What If English Were Phonetically Consistent?\"\n.\n\n\n\n\nAaron, who lives in Houston, Texas, and recently directed an award-winning film musical, Bully, hopes viewers will take two lessons from the video.\n\n“First, I hope that people gain an appreciation for how difficult it is for non-native speakers to learn English, given what a linguistic kludge it is,” he said.\n\n“Second, I think that people often get weird questions and ideas in their heads, but dismiss them pretty quickly. \n\n“I’d encourage them to dig into those instead talk about them with friends, write a sketch, or make a video. \n\n“There’s a lot of creative fodder in the weird places to which our thoughts drift.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAaron Alon (courtesy of Aaron Alon)\n\n\n\n\nAlthough his main focus is working on plays and film, Aaron’s work dissecting the English language may not be over.\n\n“I’m considering working on something to do with idioms and possibly the Oxford comma (of which I’m a fan),” he said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"imran khan elected as pakistani premier","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

We are thrilled that so many wicked witches turned up for some fun this evening. This year we’ve extended our programme, making it our biggest celebration to date, and we just look forward now to showing the world how it’s done.”\n\nYou can find out more about all the spooktacular
