Switzerland and Germany have been ided by the coronavirus pandemic. Fences, concrete obstacles or barrier tapes separate them after the borders were closed to slow the spread of the virus. But love cannot be locked away“Look, we even marked the border on our blanket,” laughs Sabrina. And indeed just below the barrier tape a black line ides the cloth in half. Lying on one half is Sabrina, from Basel on the other, Davor from Wiesbaden. We are in Riehen, the rich suburban community of Basel.It is the first time that the two of them have seen each other since the border was closed a good six weeks ago. The Covid-19 pandemic caused Switzerland and its surrounding countries to close their borders mid-March. Only people who work in another country and companies transporting goods are now allowed to cross the borders at the few crossings that are still open.It is a warm spring day. Riehen is famous for its cherry trees, thanks to the mild climate of the Rhine plain. And on these cherry trees, which are in blossom on both sides, the border guards have attached barrier tapes which now mark what is accessible. These tapes also trace the border lines which were reinforced with barbed wire during the second world war.For the people on both sides, these restrictions are a serious disturbance, as the border has hardly been noticed in recent decades. Friendships exist across borders, as do families and lovers.“Take pictures of us,” says Sabrina. “It’s good if this becomes known.” An untenable situation for her. Davor arrived today to see his girlfriend. It takes three and a half hours to drive from Wiesbaden, and he will return in the evening.Despite everything, the mood is good on this friendly day. Along the barrier tape several groups of people have arranged to meet: separated families, friends, other lovers. A group of young men has set up camping chairs on both sides of the barrier. All three are from Lörrach in Germany, the neighbouring community of Riehen. One of them is studying in Basel. This is the only place they can meet and drink beer together.The border stretches up the hill. A bit further up the edge of the forest, I meet Diethard (on the German side) and his girlfriend Sibel (on the Swiss side). Sibel, also a German citizen, works in a clinic in Switzerland: “If I were to officially go over to Germany, I would first have to be in quarantine for two weeks. That’s impossible.”Now and then an army helicopter flies along the unclear border, making sure the rules are obeyed on the ground. There soldiers reinforce the border guards. If a couple gets too close to each other on the border, the guards usually turn a blind eye.This is not the case everywhere. Further east on Lake Constance are Kreuzlingen (Switzerland) and its sister city of Constance (Germany). They have grown together completely. In some places, the fence erected by the Swiss during the second world war to prevent Jewish refugees or German opposition members from crossing the border still exists.Since the border is shorter and clearer here than at Basel, it was easier to close it again in the wake of the pandemic.Shortly after the closing of the border, I meet Katarina from Frauenfeld, in Switzerland, and Ivo, a student from Konstanz. Three times a week they meet at the border, also to exchange tenderness they met in Croatia only last New Year.Here, physical closeness was a thorn in the side of the Swiss law enforcement officers: a week later, when I saw the two of them again, kissing was no longer possible. A second fence was raised two metres away from the first, under strong protest from the local population. Now Katarina and Ivo can only look into each other’s eyes.But they still have it good: along the Italian and French borders, such meetings were always out of the question, because in Italy and France – unlike in Switzerland and Germany – strict curfews prevented this.With the flattening of the corona curve, demands are now being made to open the borders again. Not only families and couples want their normal relationship back, but also the trades that usually do good business on the other side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b65c9de0703d788c1f220a6704d600e5be628b8/0_30_4220_2532/master/4220.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=242820321209cfb2506c14dc87bb02a4","title":"buy a classic sport photograph euphoria at the 1966 world cup","story":"The latest of a  Print Shop series featuring classic sports images.

Can they stop people switching over to Netflix?This week, the most social, crowded, people-watching-oriented event of the global visual art calendar – Frieze art fair, in its New York iteration – is happening on devices everywhere. It has transformed itself into an online shop with art as the scrollable produce. The Asos effect is amplified by the fact that prices, for once, are displayed for all to see. A Martin Creed neon spelling out the words DON’T WORRY could be yours for $150,000 (£118,000).The reopening of art institutions still seems a distant prospect for many parts of the world – and the idea of the hyper-crowded blockbuster show even more so. So has the moment for digital art arrived? Artists – many of them locked out of studios and with projects, residencies and exhibitions having evaporated – are improvising with the means at their disposal. At least those, of course, who aren’t sick, or caring for others, or running up face masks on their sewing machines (like Stephanie Syjuco, the California-based artist, who has been producing around 100 a week for use by frontline community workers). Many are getting used to working in new ways, some of them digital. But this is what artists have always done. As Martin Clark, director of Camden Arts Centre in London, says: “I used to work at Tate St Ives. There it’s really noticeable that when you get to the war years, paintings became really small – because there wasn’t much canvas around. Everyone’s work changed to accommodate the material conditions. In a way, what’s happening now is no different.” (For his own institution, accommodating the conditions has meant launching an online version of a now delayed exhibition, The Botanical Mind – a site rich with texts, recordings and images, plus a new digital work by Adam Chodzko.)Some forms of digital experimentation are survival strategies. East Sussex-based painter Matthew Burrows began #artistsupportpledge on Instagram to help artists financially, given that many fragile livelihoods have been destroyed by loss of projects, residencies and second jobs. Artists post work to sell for no more than £200. Whenever they make £1,000, they pledge to spend £200 on another artist’s work – and so on. It has raised an estimated £20m for artists and makers worldwide.Supporting artists financially was also part of the idea behind Transmissions, organised by artists Tai Shani, Anne Duffau and Hana Noorali, under the auspices of Somerset House Studios in London. Every Thursday evening at 9pm until the end of May, artists invited by the trio are putting on a kind of TV show. (Episodes are not archived – be there on Twitch or catch the Friday morning repeat.) Episode one, put together by Shani, Duffau and Noorali, started with a magical journey through the cosmos to meet a beneficent goddess episode two, by Sophie Jung, had anarchic echoes of old-fashioned Saturday-night light entertainment, Basil Brush and all. Putting art out online in this way, says Shani, is using the internet “more as a carrier or vessel for work than a conceptual point”. Like many artists, Dubai-based Lawrence Abu Hamdan (along with Shani, one of the artists who won the 2019 Turner prize) posted most of his film-based works to YouTube during lockdown, though there are significant losses when works made for a gallery sit on the flat, unforgiving rectangle of a digital screen – not least that the viewer may be tempted to switch to Netflix at any second. “The first few minutes of Once Removed are deliberately almost boring,” he says, referring to a recent work about a young Druze man who understands himself to be the reincarnation of a relative who died in the Lebanese civil war. “That doesn’t work so well online.” (It is very much worth sticking with.)Goshka Macuga – whose intellectually dense work is usually based on lengthy periods of intense research – began a lockdown Instagram account, @Grekaandfriends, in which an animated version of her dog offers satirical thoughts on life, the pandemic and everything. “I went into it with the aim of entertaining people, sharing, doing something that existed outside the art market,” she says. “I think of it in the tradition of the political cartoon.” She records the sound in her loo, which has the best acoustic for the purpose, and has used a simple animation app. “It was easy, and has given me a way of having an instant voice. We don’t know what the art world will be like in the future. An economic crisis on a large scale will, of course, impact it. We may have to change the way we work. It has been a good exercise in making something that literally takes no money to produce.”Another project born from confinement is a short film by Madalina Zaharia, which will be part of Viral Portraits, an online exhibition, from 15 May, at Moderna Galerija, in Ljubljana (which has just reopened after the easing of Slovenia’s lockdown). After she was grounded in London with her partner, fellow artist Ross Taylor, the couple decided the time had come – at last – to clean their small basement flat. But, she decided, not before “documenting the mess”. Fortunately, she was in temporary possession of a film camera that could not be returned to its owner owing to lockdown, and so she got to work. The Mess Can’t Clean the Hand is a creepy, noirish little film that seems to encapsulate the domestic anxiety around clutter and mess. The hand itself is an agent of chaos – perhaps even contagion – rather than Marie Kondo-like order. (The flat remains untidied at the time of writing.)Ben Vickers, the chief technology officer at London’s Serpentine Gallery, is soon, along with colleagues, to publish a report completed before the pandemic, titled Future Art Ecosystems. One of the open – and unanswered – questions posed by the document is: “What would a major public art institution look like without physical exhibition or performance spaces?” That seems a particularly resonant line of inquiry right now. But it’s also clear that digital art has a long and complex history. What used to be called “net art” can trace its roots back to an era before the web – to the 1960s mail art movement, for example, when artists sent work by post. Organisations including New York-based Rhizome have been supporting and preserving art made to be seen online for years. Some organisations better known for their physical exhibitions, such as Dia Art Foundation, have long been working with digital art, and now may be the time to discover some of these older web-based commissions, which date to 1995. (Dia director Jessica Morgan reports an uptick of interest in these, as her audience’s attention erts to Dia’s website.) It’s too early to tell what impact the pandemic may have, says Vickers. One thing, though, that he’s spotted on a personal level, is the appeal of virtual reality at a time when much of his life, professional and social, has been conducted through the aching flatness of Zoom. He has been “meeting” with the artist Jakob Kudsk Steensen – who last year made an augmented-reality tour of Kensington Gardens called The Deep Listener for the Serpentine – in a VR environment. “I’d given up on VR a year or so ago, but the greater sense of presence you get is a relief now there’s only the flat screen. Curators are starting to think about how you could host a public event with VR, how you could really deploy it well.”Meanwhile, Glasgow International – the biennial festival that should have taken place in late April, but has now been delayed until 2021 – launched a small, well-judged digital programme that will stay online through May. It combines old, new and swiftly reworked art by some of those commissioned to show in the physical lineup. It begins with a simple audio work, Yesterday, by Georgina Starr, a recording of her whistling the Beatles song, that she made in the empty corridors of the Slade School of Art when she was a student in 1991. Heard now, the solitary voice echoing from a deserted space seems appropriately melancholic.Alberta Whittle, meanwhile, quickly reworked the film she had been making – about the Forth and Clyde canal as a metaphor for the migration of people over waterways. Now it speaks directly to the moment, drawing together the threads of the Home Office’s “hostile environment”, the Windrush scandal, and the role of immigrants as frontline NHS workers. According to Richard Parry, the festival director, some aficionados of this well-loved festival gathered together on Zoom for an unofficial opening party, with drinks and group viewing of the online works: a sense of community despite the odds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68907e553be4e02cca96461240e8eb7babcee45e/0_398_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d24f062db2b227cfcd7d5d0d10336031","title":"life on the road during coronavirus lockdown photo essay","story":"Photojournalist Sean Smith travels with long-haul drivers delivering essential goods during the UK lockdownby  Lisa O\u0027Carroll photographs by  Sean SmithFresh breezes carry the scent of spring meadows across the empty motorways as thousands of truckers keep the nation stocked with food and medical supplies.Long-haul drivers’ journeys have been cut by up to three hours and they have received heartwarming expressions of appreciation from people clapping them on their way from motorway bridges.But there is also hardship for those not in the essential goods business, and some surprising letdowns including closures of toilets and exceptional reckless driving to contend with. One car driver was recorded at 134mph in a 40mph zone in London, while Gloucestershire police clocked a driver at 122mph on the M5.But lockdown also brings out the best in people, says Bill Dommett, 62, a driver with C\u0026ampD South West, based in Chard, Somerset, during a trip with the  onboard.“You see kids, adults, elderly people waving and clapping and they have little placards. You give a hoot or a smile and you can see they are so happy. I don’t look at myself as anyone special, I’m just a lorry driver, so seeing people appreciate what you are doing although you’ve never been appreciated like that before is really nice. It’s heartwarming and brings a tear to your eye a bit,” says Dommett.He tells of another incident in the past week when he bought 15 bars of a new variety of Galaxy chocolate for his prison-officer daughter, who says it kept her going after he brought a bar home for her one night.“The cashier came round and picked up another five bars and handed them to me, saying, ‘That’s from one key worker to another, stay safe and well and hopefully see you next week,’” said Dommett. “It’s just really made me stop. What a gesture.”Mark Bagley, 45, is a night driver, cabbing a double-decker 60ft truck for the same firm. His usual route is the 340-mile return journey from Chard to a Palletforce distribution centre in Burton upon Trent, where he can drop off or pick up vital supplies ranging from bread, flour and fruit to industrial supplies.Each way takes about three and a half hours, depending on accidents, bottlenecks and congestion.Covid-19 has emptied the roads, reminding Bagley of the big open countryside of the US where the only other vehicles are the tractors and combines slowly moving through the crops.“Before coronavirus, you’d see about 300 vehicles an hour. Now it’s a completely different world. I’ve driven in the States quite a lot and it’s very similar countryside. I thought you’d never see that in this country but when coronavirus hit it was like I was driving in Wisconsin again,” says Bagley.It is not just business trips and family car journeys that have vanished, but also truck carrying non-essential goods.“It’s been very spooky,” says Dommett. “If you go to a service station now, there are two or three cars in the car park, no caravans, no coaches.”But there are upsides too, he says. “It’s so nice to be able to get into your lorry and set the cruising speed at 53 to 56mph and just stay there without having cars in front doing 50mph forcing you to use the gears.” Like everywhere, there are those flouting the lockdown rules, and Bagley says he has been shocked on one or two occasions.“The other day I had two bikers on Harley-Davidsons on either side of me – that’s the middle lane doing 80mph and his friend doing the same on the inside of me on the hard shoulder. This is in broad daylight. There was a car in front of me and a truck in front of the car and next thing the bike on the inside swerves in between the car and the truck. I thought: I hope he falls off his bike and breaks his neck. It made me really angry. “You’ve got a five-year-old girl dying of Covid and you have these 3435-year-old men messing around with people’s lives on the motorway. It was just depressing to see, especially as you have the electronic matrixes every gantry and bridge saying “Stay home, essential travel only, save lives”. It’s constant, there are no excuses. You don’t drive on the hard shoulder anyway, even at 80mph,” says Bagley.As expected, she has seen larger volumes in collections and deliveries to supermarkets, including Morrisons’ regional distribution centre in Bridgwater, Somerset, as well as garden furniture and patio tiles. But there have also been some surprises including an increase in orders for hot tubs and pools.Small breweries have stopped deliveries, while business for a client who supplies wood-burning stoves has plummeted, as fitting the furnaces would involve workers entering a home for non-essential work, which is advised against.Dommett having a lunch break on the road.C\u0026ampD South West also did a twice-weekly run to central London with hotel minibar stocks including water bottles, snack packets and chocolate. The supplier is still trading but the hotel business evaporated overnight.The decline in custom has also hit drivers. Food is no longer available at service stations, which have also closed toilets and showers.“I think it’s disgusting,” says Dommett. “We are out on the road the whole time keeping supplies moving, where are you supposed to wash your hands?” he said, underlining the risk that creates of spreading the virus between different locations.One day Dommett might be in Wolverhampton, another in Middlesbrough or nearer home, picking up or dropping off farm feed. He remembers the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, when everything and everyone entering a farm was disinfected, and cannot believe the cavalier attitude of some when it comes to hygiene and coronavirus.He thinks some depots might have used Covid-19 as an excuse to close toilets they did not want to provide for drivers in the first place.A spokesman for the Road Haulage Association (RHA) said: “It goes against health and safety as essentially a lorry driver is at work and should have access to toilets where they collect or deposit loads. We had loads and loads of complaints at the beginning and still get one or two a day. We got on to the Department for Transport and phoned the various depots too.”Hammond says she tries to keep up morale, giving drivers laminated drawings of rainbows for their windscreens and baking a seven-layer coloured cake for her workers.While her business is going OK and might be big enough to survive, she fears for the smaller family-run businesses.Paul Mummery, an RHA spokesman, says: “There are a lot of truckers out there who just want to get back to work, even if they are furloughed and that might seem like it’s OK. There’s an anxiety that volumes of trade won’t return and this is a precarious industry anyway.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a608a2b53ff6b52170a0ca092bbaed84d738b62/0_234_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa4e8af3ccc01b7b854e8b7052d65a17","title":"readers favourite coronavirus street art laugh uk lockdown houses roads shops","story":"Houses, roads and shops all over the UK have been redecorated and reinvigorated during lockdownSeeing this makes me feel proud of what we have in the UK.

They are working seriously hard in difficult circumstances to make our lives the best they can be.It also makes me proud of the people in my borough. They are pulling together, using their skills and doing their bit to check on each other and help out in these strange times. Whether it’s amazing artwork like this, online quizzes, DJ sets, online advice for business, craft making or calling up lonely people for a chat, they are all pulling their weight through tough times.This piece of work stands out and really brightens up the street. I witnessed the artist finishing the piece and people who were out on their daily walk were saying how great it was. It’s a conversation piece and makes people smile when they walk past. Jimmy Lee, DagenhamIn these difficult times street art is a great way to connect and express the way we are feeling. Vic Brown, TamworthThis curious glittery sign appeared on the street overnight and made me stop, smile and take a photo. I was pleased to see that there’s no shortage of creativity despite everything else that’s going on. Ben Park, Ealing in LondonThis made me happy. It was great to see something someone has made just to share and spread cheer. Simon Doughty, DesboroughMy partner works in our local hospital and it made her day when our next door neighbour painted her back wall in a such a glittery fashion. Ashley Woodfall, BoscombeMy wife Mel is an artist. She took the side of our house as a canvas. This is her with our daughter. She’s now encouraged all her friends to stop by when they are on their allotted exercise, take a photo and send it to her. She is then going to create a collage of the photos. Seeing this makes me feel proud. Kevin Chappell, Wirral.Seeing the message to care workers filled me with both happiness and sadness. Happiness to know that someone has created this to acknowledge and thank those who strive everyday to care for our loved ones. Sadness that these amazing people have for so long been overlooked and undervalued. Tracy Wilson, South Norwood in LondonA few weeks ago the council painted social distancing markers on the promenade. They were a bit utilitarian. A few days later someone gave the little people faces and personalities. When I first saw them, they made me laugh. I look forward to seeing them every day on my daily walk. Jacquie, Worthing.Every time I walk past this house it makes me smile as they have obviously put a lot of effort into sending a message of support to our NHS. As I was taking a photo this morning, one of the housemates was leaving and chatted about ordering the chalks from Amazon and spreading a little joy in the world. Great stuff. Peter Spark, OxfordI walk past this while taking my daughter to school. It had been vandalised for years until our local community group commissioned a local artist to create a design as a tribute to our key workers. I find it uplifting and love the fact that it’s something the whole community can appreciate. Angie Talbot, LeedsThese sign paintings have been accumulating over the past months. They have become a landmark in our area. The route is a main road between two major hospitals so ambulances pass by regularly.I like it because it is representing something we all want to say. With all the museums closed, it feels like art has found a way to come out into public space and remind us all why we need it here – and more than ever at this time. Asif Khan, Hackney in LondonI saw this on the front of a closed down takeaway restaurant. I love the bright colours and the sentiment. Annie Willetts, Sydenham in LondonI took this on the last weekend before lockdown in Manchester. I have not been in the city centre since, sticking to my local area. It makes me sad for all the amazing small businesses in this city, but hopeful that they will survive and be thriving again soon. Elizabeth Relins, ManchesterI run on the cycle path a couple of times most weeks. There is a long hoarding separating the path from a brownfield building site and it is constantly changing and evolving with artwork, ranging from some pretty crappy tags to some terrific pieces. This comes somewhere in the middle. I love how it has taken the Corona logo and made it into something more menacing and timely. I also like the “please wash your hands” strap along the top. I don’t know how long it will last, but it’s there for now. Kate Matheson, BristolWe saw this piece of street art just before the lockdown measures were put in place. It is a striking and skilful design. When we saw the work it seemed very prescient. At the time people were stockpiling toilet paper and the art work satirically incorporates a loo roll instead of a dot on the “i” in “virus”. While humorous, the work was an ominous indication of the effect the virus was going to have in the weeks to come. Michael Mulvihill, GatesheadHackney Wick is alive with street art. Every day you turn a corner and something new grabs your eye. This piece appeared early on in the crisis. To me it captures the public’s mood to the Covid-19 crisis – NHS, masks, loo roll, don’t panic. Jacqueline Bruce, Bow in LondonOur pedestrian tunnel had been a tagging magnet for a long time. The interior was greatly helped a few years ago when someone painted inidual bricks in a myriad of different shades, making the wonderful rainbow that appeared overnight on 8 April all the more perfect. Our local social media has been abuzz with how uplifting it is and how emotional people feel travelling through it. We’re all hoping it will be preserved post lockdown. Helen Wade, HoveI know my friends are missing being at school and that the teachers are missing us too, so I wanted to use my art as a voice to acknowledge that. The crossing at my school, Comberton Village College in Cambridge, felt like the perfect place to make an artwork. Rowan Briggs Smith, CambridgeThis series of posters is outside a cafe in the Cathays area of Cardiff. It’s an image of hope and sustenance that helps me remember that these dark days will soon be over.

Travellers will undergo further temperature tests at the airport, must wear face masks or other coverings and wash their hands and use hand sanitiser in terminals.On board the aircraft, they will be able to buy pre-packaged snacks and drinks, using cashless payments only. Queuing for toilets will be prohibited on board, although inidual passengers will be able to use the facilities “upon request”. Physical distancing at airports and onboard will be encouraged where possible.The measures include fewer checked bags and a deep clean of the aircraft every night with chemicals that are effective for more than 24 hours. All Ryanair planes are fitted with Hepa air filters similar to those used in critical hospital wards, the airline says.Since the Covid-19 flight restrictions were imposed in mid-March, Ryanair has been operating a skeleton daily schedule of 30 flights between Ireland, the UK and Europe. The pandemic has forced airlines around the world to ground their fleets.As a temporary public health measure, while EU countries emerge from their Covid-19 lockdowns, Ryanair will require all passengers flying in July and August to fill in details at the point of check-in of how long their planned visit will be, and their address while visiting another EU country. This contact information will be provided to EU governments to help them to monitor any isolation regulations.The Ryanair chief executive, Eddie Wilson, said: “It is important for our customers and our people that we return to some normal schedules from 1 July onwards. Governments around Europe have implemented a four-month lockdown to limit the spread of the Covid-19 virus. After four months, it is time to get Europe flying again so we can reunite friends and families, allow people to return to work, and restart Europe’s tourism industry, which provides so many millions of jobs.”Other airlines including Wizz Air and KLM have also announced a return to flying. The British Airways owner, IAG, had been planning to run 1,000 flights a day from July, but its chief executive, Willie Walsh, said on Monday it would review its plans in light of the UK government’s plan to quarantine people arriving by air. He said the number of flights would probably be “pretty minimal”.Michael O’Leary, the group chief executive of Ryanair, brushed off the 14-day quarantine, from which French and Irish travellers will be exempt. He said the exemption showed the quarantine period was not based on science, passengers would ignore it, and the UK government lacked the police resources to check on people.He told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “I don’t think this 14-day isolation will be effective. It will have no credibility among the travelling public, but it is manageable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e05074f219f3709cee1d5c5f62563d89e6f5d58/0_202_4863_2918/master/4863.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17aec908e325612b2c574b541115f766","title":"coronavirus racism bame pandemic race","story":"The BAME experience during this pandemic tells us that race is not about inidual morality, it profoundly shapes people’s livesAs coronavirus continues to rampage across the globe, it has become apparent that, while biologically the virus may not discriminate, it is having a much worse effect on people from ethnic minorities. As the researcher Omar Khan has noted, BAME Covid-19 deaths “track existing social determinants of health” such as overcrowding in homes, insecure work and lack of access to green spaces. In other words, the virus is hitting people harder not because it can see their race but because “racialised” people – those who are categorised by societies as, say, black or brown – are more vulnerable.And this is not the only way that race is playing a role in the crisis. All around the world, minority communities are disproportionately targeted by ramped-up policing that has accompanied the enforcement of lockdown measures. Data from New South Wales in Australia reveals that, although the richer, whiter Sydney beach suburbs have the majority of Covid-19 infections, it is in the neighbourhoods with larger numbers of people of migrant origin and indigenous Australians that people have received the most fines for breaching social distancing directives. The US has seen a business-as-usual approach to police brutality targeting black people while, at the same time, groups of overwhelmingly white people in New York’s West Village freely breached social distancing.Some voices are uninterested in this connection between race and the virus or treat it with derision. “Campaigners are twisting BAME Covid data to further their ‘victimhood’ agenda,” reads a commentator in the Daily . An article in Quillette – the online magazine of the so-called “intellectual dark web” – asks the question “Do Covid-19 racial disparities matter?” before concluding: “The fact is our culture is obsessed with race.” These responses are the product of a discourse in the west that for decades has claimed that “making it about race” unnecessarily sensationalises an issue. But as BAME people die and suffer disproportionately from a virus, it is clear that “race” is about power – which is very much contrary to the way that it is usually discussed.The usual discussion of race in Britain is exemplified by conservative academics and political commentators who argue against what they see as an unhelpful leftwing moralism around issues of race and migration, which silences the concerns of a working class that they portray as uniquely white. In 2018, the online publication UnHerd organised a panel discussion originally titled “Is rising ethnic ersity a threat to the west?’, before this was changed following a backlash. In response to an open letter against the event signed by more than 230 academics, two of the organisers, Eric Kaufmann and Matthew Goodwin, wrote that “large numbers of people across western democracies do feel under threat from immigration and rising ethnic ersity. There is no point shying away from it.”Labelling those concerned about immigration racists is unhelpful. But through books, media appearances and social media, these commentators created a climate where the conversation around race is defined by “free-speech rationalists” pitted against “irrational antiracists”. These antiracists see race everywhere, supposedly demonising and silencing everyone with “concerns” about migrants, Muslims or black people – the same people who are now dying disproportionately of Covid-19. But race is not a category that antiracists impose on the world, or a debating point about inidual morality: it is a factor that shapes the lives of the people who are racialised.At its most extreme, this discourse has enabled a return of eugenics – treating the pseudoscience as just another part of the marketplace of ideas. The seemingly benign term “race realism” is defended by a growing circle of pundits who argue for the spurious claims of behavioural genetics and differential IQ iding the middle class from the poor white and Asian from black people. The British associate editor of Quillette magazine, Toby Young, epitomises the worrying nexus between “free speech” advocacy, eugenics cheerleading and now coronavirus scepticism. Young has advocated for genetically engineered intelligence to be offered “to parents on low incomes with below-average IQs”. He has now started Lockdown Sceptics, a website opposing measures to stem the spread of Covid-19 by staying home. It publishes links to articles by other sceptics whose past output has the common thread of opposing antiracism in the name of “free speech”.Racial inequality is expressed in all dimensions of life. But given that it takes the form during the coronavirus pandemic of disproportionate deaths, the growing calls to relax social distancing measures across the global north further signal societies’ disregard for the lives of racialised people. This disregard was made possible – in societies that declare themselves “post-race” – by the treatment of racism as a matter of mere opinion, with commentators and activists given carte blanche to vilify migrants and Muslims, double down on anti-blackness and anti-Roma racism, and ramp up antisemitism in the interests of media “balance”.The pandemic shows us that race is not a biological fact, as the “race realists” believe, since there is no meaningful biological explanation for the BAME experience of Covid-19. Instead it is a technology of governance that shapes the life chances of many racialised people and maintains white supremacy.• Alana Lentin is an associate professor in cultural and social analysis at Western Sydney University and author of Why Race Still Matters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e3b99d1ec3646ddc6b2d8790cc5213afa9a8989/268_193_4677_2807/master/4677.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a8a83223559caac0035f7fd8ef8f450","title":"tories lockdown social distancing testing second wave coronavirus","story":"Easing social distancing without a proper programme of testing, contact tracing and isolating will lead to a second wave of coronavirusThere are no silver bullets, clever models or easy answers for how to control the coronavirus. But neither is it rocket science. Governments have three choices in how they respond. The first and most difficult path is to contain the virus through a programme of mass testing, contact tracing and isolating. This requires a huge effort: building a large infrastructure to monitor cases of the virus and identify hotspots, ensuring this system runs efficiently, providing adequate PPE to everyone who needs it, and deploying border controls to vet who is entering the country.The second path is far simpler. It involves slowing the spread of the virus by using timed cycles of lockdown and release, with the government issuing guidance on how much social distancing is required. But the side effects of this path are very costly: it risks wrecking the economy, straining health and social care systems, and creating social unrest. The third and easiest path available to governments is simply to do nothing. The virus sweeps across the population, the economy remains open and whoever makes it through is lucky to still be alive.It’s almost impossible to decipher which path the UK government has chosen. Over the past months, its response has vacillated from the third approach to the second and, more recently, to the first. While Boris Johnson’s address on 10 May made clear he has recognised the dire position in which the UK finds itself, the government’s confusing new advice – that people should “stay alert” to the virus, work from home when possible, but go to work if working from home isn’t possible – exemplified the mixed messages coming from the government.The confusion turns on an internal struggle between two opposing camps. The first seems to think the government should attempt to get over the worst of the pandemic by allowing the virus to spread through the population, albeit at a slower pace to ease the strain on the NHS, and by creating more hospital and mortuary capacity to cope with a spike in deaths. The second camp wants to drive down the number of coronavirus cases and reduce the rate of infection – or R – to as close to zero as possible. It recognises the uniquely dangerous nature of this virus, and the emerging evidence that it can cause long-term health complications in survivors and that immunity may only be temporary.These are clearly two different goals, with two different strategies behind them. The confused messaging from the government is a worrying illustration of the lack of consensus on which of these objectives and strategies should be adopted, both within Westminster and across the four nations.But this debate misses a more fundamental point: containment (the first path) is the best strategy for public health, the economy and society. The decision in early March to shift from containing to mitigating the virus was disastrous on all three of these fronts. By the time the government introduced a lockdown, the number of coronavirus cases had already increased exponentially, making prolonged quarantine necessary.Now, the key challenge facing the government is to replace this lockdown with a package of public health interventions involving mass testing, surveillance and real-time data to identify clusters of the virus and quarantine those who are infected. This will mean providing adequate PPE to those who need it, enforcing border controls and instigating a phased relaxation of social-distancing measures. Rather than putting everyone under lockdown, these measures would give health authorities information about the spread of the virus, allowing them to identify hotspots and target interventions where they’re needed.Without these measures in place, the past seven weeks of lockdown will have been completely pointless. As quarantine measures are lifted, the virus will continue to spread, the number of daily cases will rise and a second peak will become inevitable. Everyone agrees that we need to get out of the lockdown as soon as possible, but doing so will require massive investment in public health infrastructure. Countries such as South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, New Zealand and Australia have already built this capacity, allowing them to ease measures while retaining control over the virus and identifying who has it, who has had it and who could be exposed to it.The social costs of lockdown are severe. Seven weeks in, we’ve witnessed the increased use of food banks, delayed care for those needing NHS services, the closure of schools, rising cases of domestic abuse and bankruptcy among small-business owners. So why has the government made such little progress in building the public health infrastructure necessary to control the virus and ease the lockdown? You could be forgiven for thinking that the lockdown was simply a way to reassure the public that the government was “doing something”. We need to be asking: what measures has the government put in place to ensure we’re in a better position to release the lockdown and prevent a second wave?Everyone wants to know when the lockdown will end and life will go back to “normal”. The better question to ask is how we ease lockdown measures in the coming months and years while preventing a second wave of infections and keeping R well below one. There are a number of endings to this story. First, an accessible and affordable vaccine could become available within the next 18 months second, the government could embark on a resource-intensive and gruelling campaign to eliminate the virus, particularly if emerging data proves coronavirus is as dangerous as diseases such as smallpox and polio or third, antiviral therapies could become available to treat Covid-19 that make it a mild illness, so the population would gradually and safely build up natural herd immunity. But on our current path we seem destined for a disastrous ending. Lifting lockdown without the public health infrastructure in place to contain the virus will allow Covid-19 to spread through the population unchecked. The result could be a Darwinian culling of the elderly and vulnerable, and an inidual gamble for those exposed to the virus. This should be avoided at all costs.• Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a400b6f69f947c2698f5e6d9dda68c8fcf9ece5/298_468_2986_1792/master/2986.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=266e12f9d6bdab3984f4ae7e7ee56588","title":"womens research plummets during lockdown but articles from men increase","story":"Many female academics say juggling their career with coronavirus childcare is overwhelmingIn April Dr Elizabeth Hannon, deputy editor of the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, noticed that the number of article submissions she was receiving from women had dropped dramatically. Not so from men.“Negligible number of submissions to the journal from women in the last month,” she posted on Twitter. “Never seen anything like it.” The response was an outpouring of recognition from frustrated female academics, saying they were barely coping with childcare and work during the coronavirus lockdown.“I was taken aback by the nerve I seem to have hit,” she says. “I have now heard many stories from women of abandoned projects, collaborations they have felt unable to continue with, and so on. It’s extremely worrying, especially so for philosophy, which already has so much work to do in terms of gender equality among its ranks.”Having articles published in academic journals is key to being promoted at many universities, and is a critical measure of success in the government’s all-important Research Excellence Framework, which distributes around £2bn of annual funding to universities.Hannon is worried that the additional lockdown childcare, as well as caring for older family members and an increase in chores such as cooking and cleaning, is slowing up female researchers far more than their male colleagues.Dr Jenny Hallam, a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Derby, who is currently home schooling her two boys, aged seven and four, while trying to do her job, isn’t surprised. She loves doing research, but it has become a luxury she can no longer squeeze into her exhausting lockdown schedule.Two days a week she is the sole home teacher, snatching the chance to work where she can. The other three days she and her husband, who is also an academic, do relay childcare. In the evenings she catches up with emails from students who are struggling to adjust to online teaching. She is coping, she says, but it is “overwhelming and tiring” and the days feel very long.“Research has fallen by the wayside,” she says. “It’s important and I want to do it, but it’s not as urgent as supporting my students. My students and my children have to be my priority.”On top of that, Hallam has heard back from a research journal to which she submitted a paper before the lockdown, wanting her to make revisions by early June that she can’t find the time to do. She notes the journal took two months less than usual to respond. “Perhaps the reviewers aren’t parents,” she says drily.“I wrote back explaining why I would struggle to make the deadline. The editor declined an extension, saying deadlines were important,” she says.Dr Anneli Jefferson, a lecturer in philosophy at Cardiff University who is also home schooling her two boys, of nine and 12, agrees that research is the first thing to suffer when time is short. “Research is really important, but it’s not urgent. It’s not usually the thing that someone’s breathing down your neck about.”She thinks anyone with a family will be slowed down by lockdown – “but women will probably be disadvantaged more strongly”.“Many female academics will have partners with a more structured job with online meetings that are non-negotiable,” she says. “And it must be even harder for single mothers, because they are doing all this on their own.”Prof James Wilsdon, director of the new Research on Research Institute based at the Wellcome Trust, worries that the coronavirus is skewing a playing field that wasn’t ever level in the first place. “We have to be very cautious that we are not privileging those who are able to use the coronavirus situation as time to race ahead of their peers, who are held back not by talent or aspiration but by the need to do homeschooling and put three meals a day on the table,” he says.He agrees that research is not really compatible with family life in lockdown. “Research requires headspace and the ability to immerse yourself over a prolonged period.”Wilsdon, who is himself juggling work and four children at home, says: “This is also about the ision between those who have caring responsibilities and those who don’t. But I’d be the first to admit that women bear the brunt of the problem.”And the issue goes beyond journals, he says. UK Research and Innovation, the national funding body for research, and other funding bodies, are fully aware that many women will also be struggling to find time to enter competitions for new research funding. Wilsdon points out that raising money for new research is extremely important to universities, but it is less of apriority than the challenges of shifting teaching online. “No one is standing over you saying you must apply for a grant, so in a sense that becomes even more of a luxury than writing a research paper for a journal.” This worries funders, he says, but there is no easy solution.Dr Viki Male, an immunologist at Imperial College London, says there is “definitely a danger” that female academics might be taking more of a hit in the lockdown than their male colleagues and competitors. She is looking after her children, aged three and six, as well as trying to run her lab, give lectures – including a new one on Covid-19 immunity – and check in with her research students. She often notches up 16-hour days of work and childcare. She is quick to point out that her husband has taken on a lot at home too, but because she earns less, and can be more flexible about when she works, the bulk of the childcare falls to her.“It made sense for me to be on domestics from 9 to 5,” she says. “I suspect, around the country, couples have had the same sorts of conversations we had. It probably reflects systemic ways in which men’s and women’s jobs often differ.” She is concerned that women might be falling behind in the race to publish their research, and argues that even if all universities and funders agreed to make allowances for researchers who couldn’t publish during lockdown, those with caring responsibilities would still be left behind because others had had extra time to progress their research.Wilsdon, however, says that in his more optimistic moments he hopes some good might come out of the lockdown for women, and that universities might be forced to confront calls for more flexible working.“All the juggling and the hidden labour of domesticity that is part of many academics’ real lives is now being brought into view ,” he says. “Maybe when those things are raised in the future, universities will be better at understanding.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f313bdc70e7a758772d0a31fd20b1b1d7a7cf09/0_219_3285_1971/master/3285.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31aa5e6fb4f21c744dcd973158c1a130","title":"english national parks ask people not rush back beauty spots lockdown","story":"Authorities fear communities could be overrun by visitors after easing of lockdownNational park authorities in England are telling people not to “rush back”, amid fears rural communities living inside the beauty spots could be overrun by visitors.People should “stay local” and think twice before driving to parks, despite lockdown restrictions easing in England, said Kevin Bishop, the national parks officer and chief executive of Dartmoor national park. “We want people to be responsible and respectful. It’s a living, working landscape. How would you feel if you suddenly had lots of visitors suddenly descend on your home?”From Wednesday, people in England can drive to outdoor spaces, irrespective of distance, as part of the government’s relaxation of lockdown measures. Bishop is concerned that local services in national parks – home to 327,000 people – could be overwhelmed by a sudden influx of visitors.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.This could lead to a repeat of what happened in Snowdonia at the end of March when authorities said it had been the busiest visitor weekend in living memory. Bishop said: “We’re desperate to do everything we can to avoid a repeat of the images we saw of Snowdonia. That’s what we’re working to do at the moment through the steps we’re taking and messages we’re giving to people.”Park authorities wanted a phased reopening of the countryside but the government’s announcement means England’s national parks are “playing catch-up” and will work as quickly as possible to open car parks and toilets before reopening other facilities.Local communities are concerned visitors will spread the virus, with farmers worried about contamination from people opening and shutting gates. Bishop is encouraging people to stay out of settlements for the moment: “We wanted to be able to welcome people back to our towns and villages to get the footfall to aid our businesses but we don’t feel now is the time to do that. Those shops that are open have limited supply and are supplying our local community, and that needs to be the top priority.”It follows warnings from police in the Lake District that people should “take a long hard look at your own conscience” before travelling to the national park.The chief executive of Welcome to Yorkshire, James Mason, said: “In March we asked people to stay away from our many beauty spots (coastline and countryside) to prevent the spread of Covid-19. We welcome the road map to recovery but with caution. Please respect that these communities are not yet able to cope with tourism.”Welsh national park authorities welcomed Welsh government guidance for people to stay at home and told people not to visit national parks. Popular rural spots such as Snowdon and the Pembrokeshire coastal path will remain closed and people from England have been told not to cross the border to go walking on Welsh hillsides and coastlines.Emyr Williams, the chief executive of Snowdonia national park, said: “These measures in Wales mean that people cannot drive to exercise in Wales – no matter where they live – and there will continue to be no parking or access to the most popular sites in the Welsh national parks.”Lockdown restrictions have also been extended in Scotland and people should still not be driving to take exercise. A spokesperson from Loch Lomond and the Trossachs national park said: “The vast majority of people have done what’s been asked of them: they’ve stuck to the ‘stay at home’ guidance and have stayed local for exercise. We certainly hope that will continue to be the case.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a3179aa5b75e3737770774ae7fc3fea747341d9/71_61_816_489/master/816.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=025f99dce66a37f6d79b0b2e567d388a","title":"ive never seen the magnificent seven","story":"In one sense this is a glorified rip-off that guts Kurosawa’s thoughtful original, repackages it with a stylish title and fills it with guns … but it’s fun!I used to be indifferent towards cowboys. I’ve seen a few of the famous westerns, but I didn’t grow up watching them. When lockdown began, however, I started playing Red Dead Redemption 2 on the Xbox for hours every day, and my opinion warmed. Red Dead borrows from all the major films in the genre, and now I’ve finished the game I find myself hungry for more cowboy stuff. Next up is The Magnificent Seven.I know this one contains a famous theme song, which I recognise from parodies and adverts, as well as seven men who are magnificent in an unspecified way. I may have even caught snippets on TV as a kid, but they probably bored me at the time: The Lord of the Rings was always my go-to for horses and violence.I’ve also heard The Magnificent Seven was inspired by Seven Samurai, another “classic film” directed by Akira Kurosawa. (I saw this at university, where I briefly studied film.) Seven Samurai follows a group of samurai who are hired to protect a village from bandits. Many regard it to be the pinnacle of cinema, and likewise I thought it was very good.So I’ve retrieved my unopened DVD of The Magnificent Seven. A leaflet inside says that Kurosawa was “so impressed” by the film that he presented the director John Sturges with a ceremonial sword. But according to an interview in 1966, Kurosawa actually thought it was “a disappointment” – so maybe the sword was more out of politeness.As for me, I thought it was fun! Especially the first act, when Yul Brynner first assembles the Seven and we learn each of their unique character traits: the laidback one, the hotheaded one, the one who wears ties, etc. Brynner is enigmatic and Steve McQueen is cool, but my favourite is James Coburn as the steely Britt, who can outdraw a gunman with a throwing knife.I hadn’t realised that The Magnificent Seven is not only “inspired” by Seven Samurai, it’s a direct remake. The Magnificent Seven lifts the plot of Kurosawa’s film, changes the setting from feudal Japan to Mexico, and swaps the samurai for gunslingers. The story translates well into the old west, although The Magnificent Seven is over an hour shorter, meaning some of the nuance of the original is lost. Much of the interaction between the villagers and their saviours has been cut. The Mexicans don’t say all that much while the mostly white gunmen rescue them, which adds a racial undercurrent that hasn’t aged well.So yes, in one sense this is a glorified rip-off that guts the thoughtful original, repackages it with a stylish title and fills it with guns. But a fairer comparison for The Magnificent Seven might be A Bug’s Life, the Pixar film where an ant asks some bigger insects to protect his nest from grasshoppers. Again, it’s the same plot, but when I left the cinema in 1998 I don’t remember anyone saying, “Those ants are an insult to Kurosawa.”There are some new additions to the story, such as the bandit leader Calvera, whose role has been expanded. Eli Wallach does “absolutely livid” very well. The Seven spend a chunk of the middle of the film negotiating with him, which gets dull, but things pick up again at the final battle. There’s a sense of jeopardy here, even if a couple of death scenes felt rushed. I was furious to see Britt throw BARELY ANY KNIVES before he goes.Now for some more westerns. Maybe I’ll try the Magnificent Seven sequels: Return of the Magnificent Seven, Guns of the Magnificent Seven, and The Magnificent Seven Ride! Given that four of the seven are dead by the end of the first film, I’m very interested to know where they take this."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0165b238f2683a61e34e84f596748f76798fc1df/0_712_1709_1025/master/1709.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=613911b8d5818234494ee095fd45e62f","title":"nigel slater recipe for baked spring cabbage and sweet potatoes","story":"A warm and comforting midweek veggie mealPut 150ml of olive oil in a blender with 100ml of water, 10g of dill fronds and 15g of parsley leaves, then process to a vivid green dressing.

Dot 65g of butter between them, then bake for 20 minutes, until tender to the point of a knife. Baste them a couple of times as they cook.While the cabbage is baking, tip the sweet potato into a bowl and mash to a smooth, thick purée with a masher or fork, then season generously. Divide the sweet potato mash between 2 warm plates, then remove the baked cabbage from the oven, trickle over any remaining dressing and serve. Enough for 2Baste the slices of cabbage as they bake with any dressing or butter in the oven tray (and with a little more melted butter if necessary), and test every few minutes. You ideally want the outer leaves to be green-gold, lightly crisp at the edges and the stalks to be tender.Use other root vegetables for the mash, including swede or large, maincrop carrots. If you didn’t want to bake the cabbage, you can sauté it in a little oil and butter instead, basting it as it cooks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a61e4b5b179232bbdd433657f5b505dc695967e3/0_213_4251_2551/master/4251.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bde38dcfc3e4a75f1bd5fc4235b7f241","title":"manuel almunia troy deeney watford 18 seconds of ecstasy leicester championship play offs 2013","story":"When Leicester won a penalty deep into stoppage time it seemed the Hornets were departing the 2013 Championship play-offs in the semi-finals. Then came a freakish climaxEighteen extraordinary seconds. That was all it took for the pendulum to swing from dejection to delirium for Watford almost seven minutes into stoppage time, with Manuel Almunia keeping out Anthony Knockaert’s penalty with his feet, then blocking the rebound with his chest before Troy Deeney rifled the ball home at the other end to send the club into the Championship play-off final at Leicester’s expense. That freakish finale is the maddest moment Vicarage Road has witnessed.Deeney’s finish was emphatic, prompting home fans to spill on to the pitch. A minute earlier Knockaert had zoomed beyond Briggs into the box, where he fell despite little contact with Cassetti, luring Michael Oliver into awarding a penalty, a decision Watford’s then manager, Gianfranco Zola, said the referee apologised for last year. “I felt my mistake led to Cassetti giving away the penalty,” Briggs says. “At the time I was blowing, jelly legs and nursing a groin injury. Knockaert dropped a shoulder and I couldn’t move my feet quick enough. I was gutted but if that doesn’t happen then Deeney’s goal doesn’t happen … I still watch it back on YouTube now and get goosebumps every time.”Zola galloped down the touchline but tumbled as a delirious Jonathan Bond, Watford’s back-up goalkeeper, attempted to get to grips with him. The scene of stewards, substitutes, supporters and coaching staff entangled and engulfed by the celebrations is reminiscent of a Renaissance masterpiece. Briggs hauled his teammate Joel Ekstrand, grounded amid the chaos of the pitch invasion, to his feet and spotted a friend mobbing Deeney, who had whipped off his shirt and jumped into the crowd to embrace his brother, Ellis. For Deeney, it was a moment of ecstasy at the end of a season that began behind bars at Winson Green prison in Birmingham.For Rob Mackenzie, the buildup to that day began in earnest 200 miles away in the directors’ box at Bolton. On the final day of the regular season Mackenzie, then Leicester’s head of technical scouting who is now head of scouting at OH Leuven, was tasked by the manager, Nigel Pearson, with feeding updates to the Leicester dugout at Nottingham Forest. Leicester had to better Bolton’s result against Blackpool to sneak into the play-offs and Knockaert scored an injury-time winner to edge out Bolton on goal difference.“I was on the phone for what felt like an absolute eternity for the last five minutes of stoppage time, relaying what was going on,” Mackenzie says. “I wasn’t sure what to do. Do I commentate? Do I just sit here in silence? The final whistle goes and I was out of that stadium as quickly as possible. I ran to my car and I felt like Mourinho wheeling down the touchline. I was the only person in that stadium who was happy that day. To go to that game I had to give up usher duties at a friend’s wedding in south Wales but I somehow managed to get there before the speeches.”Mackenzie was responsible for opposition scouting and set to work on how to beat Watford. The first leg went to plan, Leicester winning 1-0, but the second ended in tears, Matej Vydra scoring either side of a David Nugent header before Deeney lashed in Watford’s third. Vydra’s opener was a sumptuous volley but, at the end, only one Watford striker’s name was on the lips of supporters. For the second half, Mackenzie was behind the away dugout.“It was like panning a widescreen camera from right to left,” he says of the decisive passage of play. “A couple of weeks earlier Doncaster got promoted from League One when Marcello Trotta hit the crossbar for Brentford with a penalty and they broke down the other end and James Coppinger walked the ball in to win the game. I thought: ‘Is this normal now?’”Knockaert, having won the penalty, was determined to finish the job but a teenage Harry Kane, on loan from Tottenham and a second-half substitute, also wanted to take the spot-kick. Unused on the bench was Jamie Vardy, who signed from Fleetwood the previous summer and had four league goals for Leicester he now has 119. Knockaert said he didn’t sleep for three nights but he returned revitalised the following season, when Leicester were promoted as champions under Pearson. “If ever there was a strength-of-character test, then that was it,” says Mackenzie, influential in signing the winger from Guingamp.In November 2013 Knockaert scored in a 3-0 win at Vicarage Road as Leicester recorded their 14th win in 19 league matches. “I think that showed the character the team had and he had, and I remember that was a really big win for the lads in terms of mentally putting that game to bed,” says King. “Fair to play to him for being able to brush something like that off. And it would have been easy for the Leicester fans to turn after a situation like that but they still love Anthony now.”When Watford’s players returned down the tunnel, the majority topless, Zola praised their resilience and character. “And then it was like: ‘Now celebrate,’ and we opened a crate of beers,” says Briggs. “It felt like we had won the final, just because the game was so dramatic.” The then Watford midfielder John Eustace, a substitute, recalls a party atmosphere. “It was rocking in the dressing room,” he says. “As soon as we went in, everyone sat down and shook their head. Nobody could believe it.”Zola has since said Watford over-celebrated. They lost to Crystal Palace in the final and, ironically, the only goal came from a penalty after Cassetti fouled Wilfried Zaha. That was nothing compared with the drama a fortnight earlier. “You try to re-rationalise what you have just seen and what has happened but you can’t,” Mackenzie says. “We shook our heads all the way home. Your brain does not consider that a possible or suitable end to a football game. But it very much was, unfortunately for us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e70e432715566bbdea0678b5abcbaafb6834426/140_205_3251_1951/master/3251.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66a0a52e25da5d626edee3f677cf841f","title":"premier leagues restart plan needs public scrutiny says shadow minister","story":"The shadow sports minister, Alison McGovern, has called for public scrutiny of the Premier League’s Project Restart plan to help give confidence to athletes and the public alike.The MP for Wirral South has written to her opposite number, Nigel Huddleston, with 20 questions regarding top-flight football’s mooted return. Central to her concerns are the medical protocols which the league submittedto the government this week for consideration.“People want football back,” McGovern said. “But we need to have confidence that we’re doing it in a way that supports the health of athletes and supports broader public-health objectives.”Although the government must give final approval to any plan for a resumption of play, with matches still targeted for the middle of June, the process for these decisions is expected to be conducted in private. An increasing number of Premier League players, meanwhile, recently including Raheem Sterling, Danny Rose and Todd Cantwell, have spoken publicly of their concerns over safety,McGovern has called for any government advice on resumption to be published in the House of Commons library and debated at the DCMS select committee. “I think that most people accept that in a well-functioning democracy that is what you do,” she told the . “You put yourself up for scrutiny.“I don’t think that the government can say to any sporting body, least of all the Premier League: ‘This is up to you.’ I don’t think they can say that because nobody in any governing body or any sports club anywhere across the United Kingdom is going to have access to the kind of medical and scientific expertise that the government does.“Will they therefore accept that only they can open the gateway, and that we should therefore have transparency of that advice? They should put that advice in the library of the House of Commons so that people can see it.”McGovern says that consensus is necessary not only between the league and government but also with the general public if the game is to return successfully.“People’s lives come first,” she said. “In general I think most football people are thinking about the health aspect of this. I know that people want football back, personally speaking I want to go and kick a ball about with my friends I know that would be good for my mental health. But the health of the nation comes first. I don’t know anyone in football who disagrees with that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b7bba7f8fee506b494c90a49d3b4db33f56fcbc/0_58_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9f37e8dbd3a5ebaebb92923e2674684","title":"more birds and bees please 12 easy expert ways to rewild your garden","story":"Now is the perfect time to boost the bioersity of any outside space you have – whether by buying your cat a bell or ditching the insecticidesWith humans – and our polluting, road-killing, noisy machines – largely out of the way, nature is having a big party. This is one of the few positives of lockdown to which we can cling, witness and even encourage. “The land taken up by gardens in the UK is greater than the area of all our national nature reserves,” says Mark Fellowes, a professor of ecology at the University of Reading who specialises in interactions between humans and wildlife, as well as urban ecology. Everyone with outside space, he says, “can become a nature reserve manager. You can do really simple things to affect bioersity where you live.”These days, even the most lackadaisical gardeners are taking a greater interest in whatever outside space they have, not least because panic food-buying seems to have segued into panic food-planting. Grow bags have become hard to come by and the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) has reported increased inquiries about growing fruit and vegetables.But whether or not people are growing new things, terraces, balconies and gardens are receiving unprecedented levels of attention this spring. If we employ a few bioersity-boosting tricks, we can keep the nature party in our backyards going for good.As such, investing in a pest-proof feeder is important. Fellowes recommends those that close if a squirrel, or anything heavier than a small bird, lands on them.  This does not mean bird tables should be banned, but Fellowes recommends “putting small volumes out regularly, clearing it up and putting out food the squirrels don’t like”. Goldfinches love niger seed, for example, which squirrels eschew.“Disease can spread through feeders every now and again,” says Fellowes. “Our greenfinch population was badly affected by trichomonosis that was probably spread via bird feeders. It’s not definite, but all the circumstantial evidence points in that direction.”When people get nest boxes, says Fellowes, “they get very keen and they can put cameras in the boxes. It’s fantastic: nature on your doorstep that you can really connect with.”Birds such as blue tits and great tits would naturally nest in nooks and crannies in woodland trees, so boxes are important in cities, especially if you live in a modern development. Fellowes recommends WoodStone, brick or woodcrete boxes. Not only will they last longer, he says, but also, “if you have wooden nest boxes, woodpeckers can raid them and predate the chicks”. Of course, this would happen in the wild, too, but it is a bit of a buzzkill if you are enjoying the chicks.Fellowes suggests trying boxes for a variety of birds: “You can get nice ones for robins, nuthatches and sparrows, which haven’t been doing brilliantly – a lot of that seems to be around losing nesting sites.” You can buy swift boxes, too, and even bricks made specifically for swifts or bats, if they are in your area (they tend to be near water in urban zones). Nest boxes need to be cleaned out at the end of the year. “As fantastic as it is to watch leopards in South Africa or cheetahs in the Serengeti, that’s not our nature,” says Fellowes. “The nature on your doorstep is just as interesting and worthy of attention.”Birds can’t feed their chicks the seed you put out. Chicks need bugs, so it is not a good idea to kill them. “Urban birds tend to have fewer offspring than ones in the countryside,” says Fellowes. “That’s probably to do with the amount of insects that are available to feed on in the breeding season.”Unless you are competing in the Chelsea flower show, he says, “your garden can deal with a few aphids. And if you allow natural insect populations to grow, you will attract ladybirds, which eat aphids and have crashed in numbers.”You can’t have butterflies and moths without caterpillars. “As we have simplified and tidied our gardens, we have provided fewer plants that the caterpillars can do well on,” says Fellowes. “Some of the most beautiful species feed on nettles and brambles, and most people won’t want those in their gardens. At this time of year, holly blues are laying their eggs on holly.” They feed on ivy, too. So let a little corner of your space stay wild.Fellowes suspects that, if you have room, this is the biggest thing you can do for insects – “and all bioersity in your garden. Ponds across the UK have been disappearing at a massive rate.” They are vital for swallows and swifts, as well as amphibians such as frogs, toads and newts and insects including dragonflies, damselflies and water boatmen. Size is not important. Mini ponds can be made in a bucket, an old sink or something similar. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds’ website explains how to make one. Lionel Smith, a colleague (and former PhD student) of Fellowes, has spent years developing a nature-lover’s alternative to a lawn. “Lawns are really not very ecologically friendly,” says Fellowes. “Not much lives in them and, if you fertilise, mow and water them, they’re a net CO2 contributor, rather than a typical plant that helps absorb CO2.”Covering up the spaces between neatly arranged ornamental plants with bark chippings is not great for bioersity, says Fellowes. If you want to control what plants grow in your beds, it is healthier to grow your chosen plants more densely together – another reason the cottage garden explodes with nature. Perhaps you won’t balk when a dandelion pops up when you know that pollinating insects love them.“I would never suggest anybody must follow my unkempt way of gardening,” says Fellowes. “But if you’re a neat freak, think about how you can get your aesthetics while using species that will also benefit wildlife. Anything positive you do will have an effect. You don’t have to let your garden turn into a jungle.”“I absolutely wouldn’t use pellets or the powders that you can put out to kill slugs, simply because hedgehogs can eat them and be poisoned,” says Fellowes. The old beer-trap method is a more responsible way to kill slugs. There are endangered species of slugs, says Fellowes, “but you won’t be getting those in your garden”.Slugs are excellent food for hedgehogs, amphibians, beetles and birds, so you may consider them worth having in that respect. There are humane traps, too, so you could relocate your slimy garden chompers to somewhere they will be more welcome.Fellowes is always doing research on cats. A few years back, Fellowes’ team calculated that domestic cats in the UK were killing about 185m prey items a year. “About a million birds a week,” he says. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature says that domestic cats rank third globally among alien species threatening vertebrates. Keeping cats indoors as much as possible is recommended, especially at peak hunting times (dawn and dusk) and if you live near a nature reserve. Also, putting warning bells on collars, says Fellowes, “certainly reduces predation rates”.Dump them on a compost heap, or just leave them in piles to rot down, and make a home for small mammals, amphibians and invertebrates such as centipedes – “just like in natural woodland”, says Fellowes. They could take months to break down, so you have to think carefully about where to leave them.Similarly, leaving a little pile of chopped wood will attract stag beetles and solitary bees. Alternatively, you can buy homes for the bees from garden centres. “They’re at their peak at this time of year,” says Fellowes. The homes “attract leaf-cutter bees, which are really cool to watch”. Slow worms love compost heaps, too, and one of Fellowes’ few sightings of a grass snake was in his own suburban compost heap.The thing to avoid in all of this, says Fellowes, is becoming judgmental. Decking, for instance, may not be the best thing for nature, but if you need it for practical reasons you can still invite nature in with bird boxes and thoughtful planting. “These are things that we can all do,” he says.30-Second Zoology by Mark Fellowes is published by Ivy Press.

I pay back £400 a month and still owe £10,000. All my freelance work has dried up due to the shutdown and I applied for universal credit.I contacted Sainsbury’s Bank about taking a payment holiday but all it would do was delay my next payment by a month. But despite agreeing, it still took the £400 payment. This emptied my account and led to my card being declined while food shopping.When I called to complain, the only solution offered was to make an indemnity claim on the payment with my bank but then I’d be in arrears on the loan.At the start of the crisis, the Financial Conduct Authority was quick to tell loan providers to offer consumers a three-month payment freeze. It seems, in your case, the person processing your call simply didn’t apply this. At least after we took your case, Sainsbury’s Bank moved quickly to put it right. It has now apologised, applied the full three-month payment holiday, refunded the £6 overdraft fee and will pay you a further £125 for distress and inconvenience.Better news for those looking for travel refunds. Eurostar this week announced more generous cancellation terms and has promised cash refunds.Previously, it was pushing customers into taking vouchers that had to be used to make a booking before the end of September for travel by the end of April 2021.After many complaints, it has said customers have 12 months to make a new booking, and a further six months to travel to its “core” city destinations – or nine months to its seasonal stations such as Disneyland Paris or the south of France.Passengers have complained that trains were cancelled only 48 hours before they were set to depart, in an apparent bid to get customers to accept vouchers rather than refunds. The advice is not to do anything until the day before you were due to travel, if you want a cash refund.Meanwhile, readers who bought flight tickets, but paid using PayPal rather than a credit card, have reported getting full refunds for cancelled flights. SH writes: “I supplied the correspondence from Ryanair – the cancellation plus original email offering a refund and subsequent one offering a voucher – and I received notification that the money was back in my PayPal credit account within a week. Hope this helps others in the same boat.”BA customers are now reporting being offered refunds, too, after phoning the company.We welcome letters but cannot answer inidually.

Nearly a decade later, with the MP3 era a speck in the rear-view mirror, the way to create a streaming smash is both more open and more complex. But it’s not always as pricey. Lil Nas X shelled out just $50 (£40) to create Old Town Road, a cheering country-rap daydream that became the longest-running No 1 in US chart history, racking up 19 weeks at the top. It spent two weeks at the summit of the UK Top 40 in April 2019.Despite the song’s ubiquity, it was difficult for anyone to truly hate. That’s largely thanks to Lil Nas X’s charismatic, gravel-voiced performance in which he raps about “bull riding and boobies” over trap beats and (thanks to a Nine Inch Nails sample) the loneliest-sounding banjo in the world. A year before Old Town Road’s release, he had been sleeping on his sister’s floor: his faux-flexing in the lyrics (“Cowboy hat from Gucci  Wrangler on my booty”) adds an absurdist yet autobiographical twinge to the song, evoking an underdog hustling for a life of greater means. But Old Town Road wore its creator’s struggles lightly and its straightforward, knowing silliness made it fly. It begs for choreography as much as a Steps song, and duly inspired TikTok’s viral #YeeHaw challenge (think plaid, lassos, and “Yee-Yee juice”). The dance app rocket-fuelled the song’s rise and cemented TikTok’s power to make trending songs into bona fide hits. (A year later, music’s A-list are catching up: Drake leaked his new single to TikTok, and Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj have remixed its biggest songs.)A meme demigod with a bright smile, Lil Nas X didn’t plant Old Town Road on TikTok himself: it was first picked up by a user named @NiceMichael. But he turned out to be his own best advocate – for his music, online, and himself, when he came out last summer. As Old Town Road first started to climb Billboard’s country songs chart, the US country establishment closed ranks, excluding the song from the tally. Lil Nas X responded with philosophical grace (“I think people are just ready for something different, a change within the world”), but the move stands as a grim faux pas that seems racist and looks even more embarrassing in hindsight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7cf406a48f3af31107a6fb927a8d11ed80d0106/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=534cfa390532674f7915b204b34f013d","title":"blind date takeover looking for love in lockdown part 1","story":"Lockdown has changed the way we date.

Churches will be allowed to open for private prayer and hold drive-through services. Big outdoor-based retailers such as garden centres will also be allowed to reopen.In stage two, certain types of non-food retailers can open, as can some libraries and open-air museums. In stage four, hairdressers, fitness studios and tattoo parlours can reopen and schools will open for all children on a part-time basis, blending in-school and remote learning. Cafes, restaurants and pubs will have to wait until step five to reopen.The DUP and Sinn Féin sparred in the early stages of the pandemic – Sinn Féin wanted to close schools before Downing Street recommendations – but now present a united front in steering a policy that in several aspects sets Northern Ireland apart from the Republic of Ireland as well as England.The blueprint detailed the scientific and health criteria that must be met for moving to each of the five stages. A key criterion will be the R-value, or reproduction number, which is estimated at 0.8-0.9. Authorities want to push it lower before easing restrictions.Northern Ireland has registered 438 coronavirus-related deaths, a per capita rate significantly below that of England and on par with Ireland.However, the Unite union has warned that the devastating toll in Northern Ireland’s care homes could be repeated in meat-packing plants unless there is mass testing and deep cleaning.A worker based at a Moy Park plant in Dungannon died after contracting coronavirus, part of what the union said was a cluster in mid-Ulster.The republic is to begin its own five-stage lockdown exit plan on 18 May, with intervals of three weeks.Critics have accused authorities in Belfast and Dublin of paying lip-service to coordination instead of forging an all-island strategy, as happened with previous disease outbreaks involving animals.Some of the republic’s highest infection rates are in counties along the 310-mile border, fuelling concern about possible spillover."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34e4eb28f6e7f3c7cf3e84a816e1cc1ef84f6a26/0_344_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=27217fabf661ee1b15bd9b49bf393b35","title":"gp doctor on how the coronavirus pandemic has progressed edinburgh","story":"Following his previous in-depth account of the early days of the outbreak, Edinburgh GP  Gavin Francis reports on how he and his practice have dealt with the escalating crisis since lockdownBy the time the schools closed in late March, my GP consulting room in Edinburgh had been emptied of clutter, its surfaces rendered easy to wipe down with disinfectant. It felt as if the decks had been cleared. There are almost 4,000 patients at my practice on the south side of the city, close to the university. As the lockdown began, my colleagues and I were spending our time phoning two or three hundred of the frailest, as well as the 30 or so who had been advised by the government to “shield” from the virus until July at least. On the phone we made sure they understood the advice to stay in and that they had arranged food deliveries for the coming weeks. We checked they had a “key information summary” – an electronic précis of their principal medical issues – available for paramedics, A\u0026ampE and hospital staff to access should they become unwell.In the first few weeks of the year, the pandemic had been a dreaded but distant anxiety. I had little sense of how severely it would hit us, and how much planning would be enough. The speed of its arrival was startling, and the past six or seven weeks have been unlike anything I’ve known in general practice. Now that restrictive lockdown measures are starting to be eased, cases will surely climb. My GP colleagues and I have all seen some patients with Covid-19, but because of the effectiveness of the lockdown, fewer than forecast in those dark days of March. Two of our patients have died of it – about the same proportion, 1 in 2,000, as have so far died of the virus nationwide.The agility of the NHS in response to the crisis has been impressive. Our practice has four GPs and two nurses all still travel to and from the clinic every day, and the four receptionists are still fielding and triaging calls. The appointments book is filled as usual, but now with names for the clinicians to phone back, rather than with appointment times for patients to come in.The NHS is notorious for its slow uptake of technology – I still use fax machines and pagers daily – but we can now text patients’ phones with a link to open a video call to our aged desktop PCs. There are still clinical problems for which a physical examination is imperative: those I do at the practice if the patient is fit enough to come in, or at their home if they’re not.Either way, I wear a mask, apron and visor, and two pairs of gloves. As aspiring GPs we were taught to value the subtleties of human communication – to carefully attend to body language, to silences, to the way a patient holds or evades eye contact. In a mask and visor, I feel less like a GP than an old-school surgeon, oblivious and insensitive.Two “Covid hubs” were set up in Edinburgh just before lockdown came in: one for telephone triage and one for face-to-face assessments. (A third was opened a week or two later, but then closed, because there weren’t enough patients to justify it.) The idea was to keep patients with coronavirus away from their usual GP surgeries, where risk of cross-infecting others was high.I spent the evening of 19 March at the telephone triage hub, when cases were still climbing steeply, with a glued-and-Sellotaped headset, one finger in my uncovered ear, speaking to patient after patient reporting the same pattern of symptoms: a dry irritating cough (as the virus irritates the upper airways), lack of smell (as the nose becomes infected), headache, a tight chest, fever, and a bone-weary, sagging exhaustion. A few complained of nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea, as the virus upset the digestive tract. And fear: everyone was frightened by what they had heard about this virus.The sickest patients were directed to the other Covid hub for a face-to-face assessment, and I began work there the following week. There is an efficient system in place to keep staff and other patients safe: each patient is met at the door by a nurse in mask, gloves and apron, and has their name and date of birth checked. The patients are given a mask and gloves to put on themselves. They are led down a corridor to the assessment room – a freshly mopped, stripped-out clinical space – and offered a seat. The doctor waits outside the room, puts on mask, apron gloves and visor, and goes in once the patient is alone.My training as a GP emphasised the importance of building empathy and rapport, but on shift in the Covid hub I stay as far from the patient as possible until the moment of actually examining them, even taking their medical history from the far side of the room. I remember seeing a middle-aged man there who had flown in from Italy not long before lockdown. Another who had caught the virus at his mother’s funeral. A builder who’d had a sick workmate on the last site he worked before lockdown. A young mother who thought she’d caught it on the train from London.On shift one Thursday evening, we all stopped at 8pm to listen for the sound of clapping, but the clinic is surrounded by hospital buildings, and the night was silent. “It makes my toes curl anyway,” said one of my colleagues. “I’ll be glad when it stops.”“I like it,” I said. “It’s the one time of the week I get to see all my neighbours.” For me, those Thursday rituals are far more about people cheering one another, than they are about thanking the NHS.Scotland was at an earlier stage in the spread of the disease as lockdown came in even so, nationwide distancing measures should have come in earlier – by early April, with the upswing in cases steepening, we could all see that. Making call after call, seeing patient after patient, I thought how we’d been like toddlers on the beach, watching the waves edging ever-closer up the sand, but still squealing with shock when the water rolled over our toes.On 3 April, Boris Johnson, at home isolating with coronavirus, posted a video online. He was visibly overbreathing, interrupting his sentences to take brief gasps. Two days later, he was admitted to hospital, and on 6 April he was moved into intensive care. The BBC was publishing flow charts of how the transition of power would work if the prime minister died.The trajectory of his illness was by now familiar: a week or so of flu-like symptoms, and then, between day seven and day nine, just as most patients start to improve, the onset of worsening breathlessness. Covid-19 has been called a “biphasic” illness, for these two phases – the first “virological”, as the body confronts the virus, and the second “immunological”, as misdirected messages from the immune system thicken the lungs and the lightest, airiest part of the body becomes sodden with fluid.In my part of Lothian, there are usually two cars providing emergency GP home visits at the weekends and in the evenings. A few days after Boris Johnson was admitted to hospital, I was out in Car 2, driving to a visit in the most urgent triage category, which means getting to the patient within one hour. The experience was a fairly typical snapshot of what it’s like to make home visits as a GP right now. On the phone, the patient had said that after a week of flu-like symptoms he was breathless even when lying on his sofa, and had a fever. It was early evening as I drove to his house. Westering sunlight was turning the suburban streets golden and blackbirds were singing in privet hedges. I phoned the patient from the car for directions. His breath came in gasps, his sentences interrupted.“Are you alone?” I asked. Yes. “Can you sit near the door?” Yes. “Just to warn you, I’ll be wearing an apron, mask, visor, gloves. I’ll give you a mask and gloves to wear, too.” OK. “If you sit near the door, it’s easier for me – I won’t have to come all through the house to find you.” OK.I ignored the twitching curtains of the neighbours, the kids out on their bikes. Earlier in the shift, leaving another home visit, a patient had asked me, “Can you shout to the neighbours that I don’t have Covid?” Now I stood at the back of the car, opened the boot, and began The Great Faff – another new protocol to get accustomed to. Thermometer, oxygen sensor, stethoscope, all placed into a clear plastic bag. Apron on, mask on, gloves on. Then a second pair of gloves over the first. The apron flew about in the wind. (Some of my colleagues have been sellotaping the thin flapping plastic to their legs.) Visor on last – its frame was 3D-printed in green plastic, with clips for attaching a head strap to the back, and a clear acetate shield to the front. On the inside of the forehead band was written Car 2 in permanent marker.At the patient’s front door, which was ajar, I breathed in the smell of stale cigarette smoke. The man was sitting on a stool just inside the door, elbows on his knees, bracing his chest with his arms to better move air in and out of the lungs. He was wearing grey pyjamas that had lost a couple of buttons.“How are you doing?” He grunted an acknowledgement. “Can you manage on with one of these?” I handed him the mask, but he couldn’t tie the strings of it. Wishing my forearms weren’t bare, I leaned over him, holding my breath, and knotted the ties at the back of his head and neck.I counted his breaths – fast, at 28 per minute. I put a digital thermometer in his ear and it flashed red with an impressive fever. I put an oxygen sensor over his finger – by shining light through the skin, it can gauge the oxygen content of the blood. His was worryingly low. His pulse, even sitting down, was galloping along at more than two beats a second.“Could you stand up for me?” I asked. We shuffled awkwardly on the small landing in a doleful dance. He turned his back and I lifted his pyjamas to place my stethoscope on his back. The sound of air through his lungs was accompanied by a quiet hissing sound, like sizzling fat. The sound of pneumonia. In his case, pneumonia probably caused by Covid-19.“I’m going outside, then I’ll phone you about what happens next,” I told him. I picked up the clear bag with my stethoscope, oxygen sensor and thermometer, and stepped out, trying to hold central to my awareness and every action that there was virus on the walls, the door handle, my gloves and all my equipment.Out on the doorstep I gulped down the fresh air, then it was back to the rigmarole: topmost layer of gloves off and into a waste bag. Still wearing my underlayer of gloves, I took a chloride wipe and began to clean all the equipment – stethoscope, oxygen sensor, thermometer – and placed them into yet another clear plastic bag, ready for the next patient. The wipe went into the waste, then my apron. Next it was the visor’s turn to get cleaned, and afterwards I placed it on the ground to dry. Then undergloves off, mask off, the clinical waste bag tied off and sealed, and back into the car.With the donning and doffing of PPE, and cleaning all the equipment, home visits now take far longer than they used to. I’d be happier wearing a gown in addition to the gloves, mask and visor – it would better protect my arms, trunk and legs from droplets carrying the virus. But for now, there are no gowns available. A few days earlier, I had looked through the supplies of gloves and masks that had been delivered to my practice from central government stores: the masks were stamped with the name of a Canadian company, manufactured in China, and distributed by another in Germany. My gloves were all manufactured in Malaysia or Vietnam. If we’re to get this equipment to the people who need it in the UK, we need manufacturers here – and production should have started in January.From the car I dialled the man’s number again. All those years learning about personal consultation styles, and now I was breaking bad news by telephone from a car parked outside. As I waited for him to pick up, I glanced at the car mirror. My forehead was stamped with Car 2 in reverse, transferred in sweat from the visor headband.“I think it’s likely that you have coronavirus,” I heard myself say, “and that it’s affecting your lungs, causing pneumonia. That’s why you feel so breathless.” Silence. “I’ll arrange for an ambulance to come and take you to hospital.”I waited. His breathing was audible. “Is there anything you’d like to ask?”“How long for?” he said.Heading on to see the next patient, I passed the ambulance I’d just called, on its way to collect him. The paramedics both waved, and I waved back – one, who wasn’t yet wearing his mask, smiled. One of the few consolations of this pandemic is its grim camaraderie, a new fellowship among the fear.Later on I walked along from the GP clinic to the A\u0026ampE department to see how my patient had fared. One of the nurses called up his x-ray on the screen: the lungs should be light and spongy, the blackness of air clear against the white of the ribs, diaphragm and heart. But an “infiltrate” had clouded his lungs. Where there should have been a black void, there were speckled galaxies of white.“How old is he?” the nurse asked me.“Mid-50s,” I said. “Like the prime minister.”“Overweight?” she asked. I nodded.“They’re all like that, up in ITU,” she said. “Strange days.” We paused together for a moment in silence in front of the x-ray, before she had to attend to another patient, as did I.Throughout April, I watched maps online showing the number of cases growing worldwide, with red dots bloomed into wide circles, like spores in a petri dish. Between 1 April and 15 April they doubled from 1 million to 2 million deaths tripled from 50,000 to 150,000. Epidemiological studies were published showing that without limitation on its spread, the coronavirus has the potential to cause 30 million deaths, comparable to the Spanish flu of a century ago.Meanwhile, the lack of testing in the UK, even among healthcare staff, was becoming alarming. One of my colleagues came down with Covid-19 symptoms on a Friday, couldn’t get tested until Monday, and by Wednesday evening we were still waiting for her result. Five days from symptoms to result, five days of not having a GP working. Five days, as well, of the GP’s husband – a hospital doctor – not working, as he, too, had to self-isolate.As hospital cases plateaued in April, the virus began to take hold in nursing homes. There are two nursing homes on my practice’s patch in Edinburgh one had an outbreak affecting four or five patients, but it was swiftly and professionally contained. None of the residents died of it. The staff reassured me they had sufficient PPE. I began hearing stories of nursing homes that weren’t so lucky – that had seen every resident infected, and a quarter had died. I also heard of homes that had no protective masks or gloves.At the same time, it was obvious that, in the wider community, lockdown was helping slow transmission. The numbers in ITUs (intensive therapy units) dropped consistently from a peak around 9 April. We GPs were sent a message of praise from the hospital, thanking us for doing so well at keeping people away. But it was becoming harder to field patient frustration at the shutting down of much of what the NHS used to do. No outpatient clinics, no colonoscopies, no sexual health services, no routine x-rays – so much has been put on pause. Even cancer services have been stripped back to essentials, and many routine lab tests have been cancelled to create capacity for coronavirus testing.Many whose mental health was already tenuous before the crisis now feel unmoored, desperate and angry. The inescapable uncertainty that comes with the disease is particularly difficult to live with, and I’m grateful, as a GP, to at least have reliable work. For those whose jobs offered identity and a sense of purpose, being furloughed has been a tragedy exacerbated by forced disconnection from friends and family. Many children, my own included, are missing the structure and social life of school, and every day I hear of more best-laid plans being added to the bonfire of this global crisis.The UK maintains relatively few critical care beds in comparison with its neighbours. Before this crisis, there were around 40 ITU beds in Lothian for a population of 850,000.. Now that number has been increased to 113. With the new critical beds added, the UK is at roughly the same levels as pre-pandemic Italy and Bulgaria.The peak of Covid-19 bed occupancy in Lothian’s ITUs was on 9 April, when there were 42. Ten days later there were 30, and they stand now at 11. A friend who is an ITU consultant in the Midlands told me that only four in 10 of his patients who are intubated due to Covid-19 survive it.On Sunday 10 May, Boris Johnson relaxed some lockdown measures for England, while Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland kept their own stricter measures in place. Johnson encouraged a return to work, but asked people to avoid public transport, and said that driving to work and to places for exercise would be permitted. I asked my ITU friend what he thought of the speech. “No mention of facemasks in public? Everybody in their cars? I think it’s an experiment at the expense of the English,” he said.On 7 May, the first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, had extended our lockdown, shortly after recommending the use of “cloth face coverings” on public transport, in shops and in places where physical distancing isn’t possible. On 10 May, she announced that she had “asked the UK government not to deploy their ‘stay alert’ advertising campaign in Scotland”. The message in Scotland, Sturgeon said, was not “stay at home if you can”, but “stay at home full stop”.The lockdown has already had profound social and economic consequences. It’s likely that unemployment is going to soar this summer, and unless robust housing legislation is put in place, so will evictions. On my occasional work at the Access Practice, a GP clinic providing health services for Edinburgh’s homeless population, I’ve seen how they’re preparing for a surge in need.In late March, the Scottish government, public health officials, charities and local authorities came together to mitigate the worst of the pandemic’s effects on homeless people, with an initiative brokered by the charities Streetwork and the Bethany Trust. By the evening of 24 March, 80 of the city’s rough sleepers had moved into rooms in one of the city’s empty hotels. With homeless shelters closing to minimise the spread of Covid-19, another hotel was opened as a temporary night shelter. Mobile outreach clinics were set up in each hotel, and rapid detox and methadone programmes initiated for those who needed them.I was due at the outreach clinic in one of the hotels last week, but just before attending, I came down with a viral headache. I felt weak, nauseated and feverish, so instead of going to the clinic I went to a test centre, where a knitting needle of a swab was plunged into the depths of my nose.While waiting for the result, I phoned Rankin Barr, the service manager of Streetwork, to arrange a visit to the outreach clinic, and asked him about the effects of the lockdown. “The people presenting for emergency shelter are not your traditional rough sleepers,” he said. “Many are coming from domestic problems, relationship breakdowns – with lockdown they can’t stay with family, can’t go to B\u0026ampBs.” We spoke of how much had been done so far – of the rapid setting up of clinics, of food provision, immigration advice and vaccination programmes, and how the city council was even now procuring more emergency accommodation for the emerging social crisis. The calamity of the pandemic has triggered a new attitude and approach to the city’s chronic housing shortage. “This virus has changed everything, but there’s an opportunity from now to do things differently,” Barr told me. “The city and public health authorities are completely on board. We just can’t lose all the vital work that’s been done.”My result came through: negative. I felt better, and will be able to visit the outreach clinic later this week. On the phone recently, I asked one of the doctors organising treatment for the homeless, John Budd, how many cases he’d had to deal with. “We’ve been lucky so far – unbelievably, there has only been one confirmed case. That’s perhaps symbolic of just how marginalised the homeless are from society. But when it enters this relatively closed community, it will spread like wildfire,” he said. “But this virus is like Voldemort,” he laughed. “We know it’s out there, we just don’t know when it’s coming back.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c733c8916244906fdd4e6c4e89cb917ed135678/132_0_3531_2121/master/3531.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96121060f9417105440a4768d32f0e02","title":"regular gamblers up the stakes during uk lockdown","story":"While sports betting has fallen, problem gamblers are spending more time and money online, prompting calls for actionRegular gamblers have stepped up their betting during lockdown, prompting a call from the industry regulator for firms to introduce new measures to protect vulnerable people.The Gambling Commission found that, overall, gambling is down due to the absence of sporting events such as football, which typically attracts a high volume of occasional bettors.But data from the polling company YouGov found that nearly two-thirds of “engaged” gamblers – those who spend on three or more betting products a month – have increased the time or money they spend.The regulator published the evidence amid concern among MPs and campaigners about the industry’s commitment to protecting vulnerable people, including by curbing advertising.The commission said companies should now take further steps to protect people.These include ceasing to offer bonuses to customers displaying indicators of gambling-related harm and a requirement that firms interact with people who play for longer than an hour to ensure they are not in distress.The guidelines also say gambling firms should prevent reverse withdrawals, which is where a customer wins money, opts to withdraw it into their bank account, but then cancels the transaction and ploughs it straight back into another wager.Reverse withdrawals are a controversial feature of online gambling and are cited by the commission as indicating that someone may not be in control of their betting.Tighter player protection measures such as these could become a permanent fixture, depending on the outcome of a review, which the commission is bringing forward.The sports minister, Nigel Huddleston, said: “It is vital that people are protected from the threat of gambling-related harm and I welcome these latest steps from the Gambling Commission.“We will continue to monitor the situation closely and will not hesitate to take further action if required.”“Operators must use the data they hold to protect their customers and now, more than ever, it’s vital that online operators really know their customers by monitoring how long they are playing for and understanding how financial uncertainty is impacting them and what they can afford to gamble with,” said the commission’s chief executive, Neil McArthur.“We are monitoring online operators closely and if we see irresponsible behaviour we will step in immediately, suspending licences if we need to.”Under the guidelines, operators should also review the trigger points at which they carry out problem-gambling checks on new customers, whose typical patterns of play are not yet well understood.Where there is suspicion of a problem, the customer should be blocked pending affordability checks to ensure they are gambling within their means."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d238ac9e70ec862bf34ca9fd1ee54896a8b05d2/0_70_2480_1489/master/2480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3159df5889a65620efabc655f8fa2cdd","title":"sebastian vettel to leave ferrari formula one team at end of year reports","story":"Sebastian Vettel will leave Ferrari at the end of the year after contract negotiations between the four-times world champion and the team broke down.The 32-year-old’s deal concludes at the end of 2020 and despite both Ferrari and Vettel previously expressing their ambition to extend it, Vettel bluntly stated there was now “no longer a common desire” to work together.Vettel won the world championship four times with Red Bull between 2010 and 2013. He joined Ferrari in 2015, with both parties optimistic he would return their first drivers’ title since 2007. However neither drive nor team have proved able to match the dominance of Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton, failing to really challenge for the title.Vettel insisted the decision had not been motivated by a failure to agree on money but Italy’s Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper recently reported he had been offered only a one-year extension with a salary reduction. The German has been clear in the past for his preference for a three-year period.“The team and I have realised that there is no longer a common desire to stay together beyond the end of this season,” he said. “Financial matters have played no part in this joint decision. That’s not the way I think when it comes to making certain choices and it never will be.“What’s been happening in these past few months has led many of us to reflect on what are our real priorities in life. One needs to use one’s imagination and to adopt a new approach to a situation that has changed. I myself will take the time I need to reflect on what really matters when it comes to my future.”Ferrari have already made a long-term commitment to Vettel’s teammate Charles Leclerc, with a contract until 2024. They have been open in their belief that Leclerc represents the future. The team principal, Mattia Binotto, stated that Vettel and Ferrari no longer shared objectives.“It was not an easy decision to reach, given Sebastian’s worth as a driver and as a person,” Binotto said. “There was no specific reason that led to this decision, apart from the common and amicable belief that the time had come to go our separate ways in order to reach our respective objectives.”The decision has reopened the drivers’ market, with one of the most sought after seats in F1 now open. Both Renault’s Daniel Ricciardo and Carlos Sainz of McLaren are out of contract at the end of this year and considered to be potential replacements. It also raises once more the possibility that Hamilton, whose contract also concludes this year, could switch to the Scuderia. The British driver, who has won five of his six world titles at Mercedes, has, however, made clear his intent to stay with his current team.For Vettel the decision may preempt his retirement as he has few options to continue in a competitive car on the current grid. Mercedes are understood not to be interested in signing him while Red Bull have said they are satisfied with Max Verstappen as their No 1 driver. There may be options at Renault or McLaren but both teams are firmly in the mid-field and as things stand in no position to challenge for wins.Ferrari openly declared Vettel to be their No 1 driver last season, stating they would favour him over Leclerc, who was in his debut year with the team. However it was the 22-year-old who comprehensively outperformed the German, beating him in points, wins and poles. There had been tension between the pair, including a prearranged track-position agreement falling apart in Russia and a crash in Brazil. Ferrari had already announced that this season the pair would be allowed to race without favouring one over the other. Leclerc insisted their relationship remains amicable.“It’s been a huge honour for me to be your teammate,” he wrote on Twitter. “We’ve had some tense moments on tracks. Some very good ones and some others that didn’t end as we both wanted, but there was always respect, even though it wasn’t perceived this way from the outside.”Formula One has yet to hold a race this season because of the coronavirus outbreak but is still aiming at staging 15-18 meetings. The first round is due to take place in Austria on 5 July, immediately followed by another at the same venue before holding a further double-header at Silverstone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c535587fe04a8dd27b65a7865b08e5911ae48724/0_438_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a24345553c322569cc389bd4968d6343","title":"disney fast tracks hamilton film for july lin manuel miranda","story":"Streaming service moves forward launch of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Broadway hit by a year, to just before the US Independence Day weekendAn eagerly anticipated film of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s landmark Broadway musical Hamilton has been fast-tracked for digital release.

If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me.”Musk’s announcement followed a weekend of escalating threats by the entrepreneur against the county that is home to Tesla’s only car factory in the US, in the city of Fremont. On Saturday, Tesla sued Alameda county, alleging that the local public health order violated California’s constitution. Musk also threatened to move its headquarters and “future programs” to Texas or Nevada “immediately” and suggested that the company may not continue to “retain Fremont manufacturing at all”.Musk has for weeks railed against restrictions put in place to mitigate the spread of the virus that has killed nearly 80,000 people in the US and more than 285,000 people worldwide. The billionaire entrepreneur has become one of the most high-profile purveyors of misinformation about the virus, regularly promoting false messaging about the disease to his more than 34 million Twitter followers. Musk has also appeared to lend his voice to the fringe political movement equating public health measures with government oppression, referring to shelter-in-place orders as “fascist” and tweeting messages such as, “FREE AMERICA NOW.”Musk’s most recent grievance stems from the fact that his factory is located in a part of California that has stricter rules for reopening than the rest of the state. On 7 May, governor Gavin Newsom announced rules to allow some manufacturers to reopen on 8 May. However, the statewide rules do not supersede local restrictions, if they are stricter, and many of the state’s most populous counties, including seven counties in the San Francisco Bay area, have decided to keep in place their more stringent rules through the end of May.On Monday, Newsom said during his daily press briefing that he was not aware Tesla had reopened but that he had “great expectations that we can work through at the county levels”, adding: “We look forward to many, many decades of that relationship with Tesla.”State law allows a fine of up to $1,000 a day or up to 90 days in jail for operating in violation of health orders.Any arrests at the factory are highly unlikely. A spokeswoman for the Fremont police said that the department has not yet issued a single citation for violating the coronavirus public health order in the city of approximately 240,000 people, and that “all matters have been mitigated through compliance”.The spokeswoman referred questions about Tesla to the county public health department. “We do enforce the order at the health officer’s direction, but we have been told they are in active talks with Tesla surrounding safety protocols,” she said. “We have not received any additional information or direction.”The county health department said Monday that it was aware that the Tesla factory was operating beyond the “minimum basic operations” that are allowed, and that it had “notified Tesla” that it was not allowed to do so until the company and county agreed on an safety plan for reopening.“We are addressing this matter using the same phased approach we use for other businesses that have violated the order in the past, and we hope that Tesla will likewise comply without further enforcement measures,” the county said in a statement.The Tesla plant has been closed since 23 March. The factory employs about 10,000 workers. On Monday, the plant’s parking lot was nearly full, prompting speculation that the company planned to defy the public health order even before Musk’s tweet.“We’re happy to get back to work and have implemented very detailed plans to help you keep safe as you return,” an email to Tesla employees stated, according to Reuters.Tesla says it has safety procedures to protect workers including increased cleaning, enforcement of social distancing, providing face coverings and gloves where needed, installing barriers between workers when necessary and worker temperature checks at some locations.Alameda county had recorded 2,101 cases of Covid-19 and 71 deaths as of Sunday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e9a811a74a67e0907386d3fff3c4aad4dd29b87/0_282_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d17e64f8c148f4fe03fa3b5f46cd546d","title":"how to conduct a remote interview seven tips for schools hiring teachers","story":"A former deputy headteacher reveals how to ace the remote recruitment process during lockdown and hire a teacher perfect for your schoolAs a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, more schools than ever are recruiting new teachers online. How can you prepare effectively to make the most of the remote interview process? This handy seven-point guide will help you keep in mind the questions you should be asking any potential new members of your staffroom. The teachers on your candidate shortlist might know their ABCs from their hypotenuses – but what do you need to do to get the best out of them in a remote interview?1. Prepare your questions – and answersAn online interview is like any other – make sure you’ve set your interview agenda. If you’re interviewing with another member of staff make sure you’ve decided who will ask what questions – and also, who will answer any questions from your candidates. Key questions you should be prepared to answer would include: What makes the school unique? What does the school need to improve? Does the school provide personalised, professional development? How would pupils, parents and other teachers describe your school? And be prepared to include a range of pupils and teachers in the recruitment process. Those who do this now should find themselves ahead of the recruitment process.2. Find a quiet space When you’re conducting the interview make sure you’re in a quiet space, with a background that is tidy and clear. It’s also worth considering how you position your microphone and camera lens so that you can present yourself from the waist upwards. Simple stuff I know, but you’d be surprised how many do not consider camera angle and lighting positioning. It could make the difference in a successful appointment!3. Ensure your technology is up to date It’s worth making sure your browser is running the latest updates and that you’ve got a reliable broadband connection. Check both camera and microphone are working with your fellow teachers before you are on an interview video call. It’s worth giving candidates details of the technology you use in advance of your interview, so they have time to familiarise themselves with the differences between Zoom, Skype, Google Hangouts or Microsoft Teams.4. Prepare to multitaskLearn how to speak to the camera lens, make notes as well as use the video technology to navigate between your camera, the screen and the microphone. When you are not speaking, for example, you may wish to mute your microphone so that the interviewee does not hear any distracting background noises. If you take time to rehearse, this will also help schools make better appointments today rather than after discovering where and how the technology lets you down.5. Offer to let candidates speak to colleagues Once you have set the interview agenda it can be helpful to arrange for an informal meeting with colleagues already working at the school. Select a range of teachers who best represent your school, to show your potential as a good employer. For example, a member of the support staff, the school receptionist, a member of staff who has just joined the school and a member of staff who is leaving the school. You’re looking to give an indication of the school’s culture. This may be difficult to achieve remotely, but it’s not impossible. Plan to have this in place, now.6. Offer a pupil interview if possibleTechnology may also be able to offer the capacity for a pupil interview experience, or perhaps even an online lesson for the candidates to teach with the panel observing as part of the application process. If you are able to provide the opportunity for candidates to teach a lesson online, it’s critical to offer as much information about the lesson and the children for it to be an effective exercise. Of course, during a pandemic, going about teaching online will be immensely different from teaching face-to-face: watch to see how teachers engage the pupils in a virtual classroom. How do candidates communicate effectively through a camera lens? Can they question, hold to account, and provide feedback to pupils online?7. Can you offer a virtual tour?One of the key opportunities at interview is a tour of the school. Doing this remotely presents a significant challenge, but again, those innovative school leaders will already be working ahead of the bell curve. Beyond the school website, most schools will have a range of images of events taking place on site, with photo galleries and online videos. It’s worth making sure your school’s social media strategy shares positive news stories with the general public, as well as pupils and parents, and prospective teachers. With most schools open during Covid-19 in a limited capacity, there will be an option for school leadership teams who are currently on-site to provide applicants with a virtual tour of the school facilities, classrooms and office spaces. This will allow potential candidates to ask questions or gain a perception of potential employment opportunities.Appointing teachers during a pandemic is difficult, but it’s not impossible. To ensure your school isn’t missing key appointments when all schools resume full service, it is critical that your school considers remote recruitment ideas now.If you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiters.the and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit our jobsite"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b64c0f636f3690d5155b3d549d130742b4b3be93/0_118_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d50164f93cb2f968cf2f8c49cea81a27","title":"looking to teach at a new school heres how to find the one thats right for you","story":"How do you get a feel for what a school is really like when you can’t walk through the playground or see what’s on the whiteboards? For teachers in the remote recruiting market, here’s how to make the most of the virtual experienceWhether it’s your first job after teacher training or you’re an experienced hand, evaluating a potential school is a crucial part of the interview process. But how do you do that remotely? Here are top tips for teachers applying to work at a new school under lockdown.Prepare for remote interviewsAlthough the coronavirus pandemic presents us with many challenges, it’s worth remembering that schools and supply agencies have been recruiting teachers online for almost 20 years. Independent and English language international schools are increasingly recruiting teachers via video to work with them overseas. The current lockdown has forced all schools across the UK to reconsider how they recruit teachers.Be tech-readyOn both sides of the camera it is critical to check the video technology, the microphone and your background environment when conducting an interview via video. What apps will they be using? Have you used them before? If not, rehearse with a friend.Think the process throughIt is crucial to find a school which best meets your needs. Find as many schools as possible before you begin any application process. This will give you motivation, as well as building up a network for future job opportunities.Visit the school – virtuallyIn order to determine which type of environment you feel most comfortable with, one important planning aspect to consider is your journey to and from the school, should you be successfully appointed. Under normal circumstances it’s worth considering a trial journey during peak commuter hours to see if the journey is manageable. Under the current conditions, it’s worth trying to arrange for a virtual tour of the school site – just as you would for a position that involves relocating to the other side of the country, or an international job. A conscientious school leader should be more than happy to take candidates on a video tour. This is even more critical during lockdown when all schools are struggling with recruitment.Prepare your applicationLook at the key facts listed on the job advert, and evaluate how they match up with the person specification – not the job description. Think carefully about what you can offer the school. Initial research on examination performance, pupil demographics and inspection reports will help you identify key priorities in the application. It would also be wise to consider why you want to work at the school. For more on this, see the five-minute interview plan. Regarding referees and references, it is always worth asking permission and giving those key people a “heads-up”. References are frequently requested with limited time for the referee to respond, putting them under pressure. You don’t want to put your job application in jeopardy!Submitting your application Spellcheck, spellcheck, spellcheck! Whatever you do, do not copy and paste bog-standard educational cliches and fire off application after application without due diligence. I’ve seen thousands of applications thrown in the bin because they accidentally mention another school’s name, have grammatical errors or include inappropriate information (no one needs to know your astrological birth sign!). Ask a friend to proofread your application. Show the reader that you have conducted some research, posing questions and thoughts, as well as some solutions with evidence of things that you have contributed towards in your current role. Remember, you can discuss finer details during the interview, so keep the facts concise.Plan your questions The easiest way to discover if a school leadership team is on track is to ask direct questions at the interview. For example: “How many teachers left your school last year?” “How much of the overall budget does the school protect for professional development?’’ “Why should I work at your school?” “Is the school budget in deficit, if so by how much?” If these questions are avoided, it’s a good indication that this might not be the school for you.Nail that interview!Be prepared, rehearse potential questions and answers, pick out what you will wear on the day – even for an online interview. Show interest and be conscientious by keeping your questions and answers concise. Whatever you do, do not be late: in an online interview, there really are no traffic excuses.Have your answers readyBe prepared to answer a range of challenging questions, and rehearse a variety of scenarios where you can provide concise answers. What would colleagues say about you? What area of the teaching standards do you most need to work on? What has been the greatest challenge in your career to date? Where do you want to be in three years’ time? Why do you want to work in this school? When it comes to “awkward” questions, they can often be a test of how professional and measured you will be in your response, rather than the answer itself.Final questionsFinally, asking questions at the end of an interview, always have two or three questions prepared. Whatever you do, make sure you ask them. It shows the interview panel that you are prepared, interested and it is your one opportunity to put them on the spot and turn the tables in the process.If you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiters.the and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit our jobsite"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55f1622a0eb54040ce4ec2c7da77870f2d120e7d/0_276_5121_3073/master/5121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=703fa1814e91baa9df95c9651da83d53","title":"the new rules of remote recruiting how to prepare for an online interview","story":"The Covid-19 lockdown has completely reshaped the way companies operate – even once restrictions are eased, many expect remote working to stay. So how can you impress a potential new boss from home?Candidates in their dressing gowns, dogs and children running about, partners in the background watching TV, or piles of dirty washing up on the kitchen counter – with 25 years in the recruitment sector, David Stone has heard it all when it comes to disastrous video interviews. “When people are working at home, because it’s your personal space, a lot of candidates completely overlook the fact that it’s still a formal first meeting,” Stone, the founder of MRL Consulting Group, says. “It’s amazing what you see going on in the background.”Holding interviews remotely – whether by phone or video – isn’t a new concept, particularly for companies that have built remote, international teams. Nor is the use of technology in the recruitment process, with an influx of artificial-intelligence tools that source and screen candidates hitting the market in recent years. There are algorithms that can analyse candidates’ tone of voice, facial expressions, and speech patterns during video pre-assessments, scoring them against an ideal profile for that role. Graduates have reportedly spent thousands of pounds learning how to beat these systems.But for many companies, still recruiting during the global Covid-19 lockdown, moving the process online can be a daunting prospect. Stone recommends all involved – recruiter and candidate – treat a remote interview like a traditional, face-to-face meeting as much as possible. “Get up, get showered, put a suit on,” he says. “Pay consideration to what can be seen on that camera behind you. Make sure you’ve got an hour’s worth of peace and quiet.” Some candidates may be more nervous appearing on video than they would be in person, he adds. “You’ve got to try and get past that. Build rapport, put them at their ease, get them talking about subjects they’re comfortable talking about so they relax.”Ellie Wilson, the co-founder and operations director of Virtalent, has run hundreds of remote interviews since launching her virtual assistant service six years ago. She’s found the recruitment process much more efficient when it’s all online. “We can go from someone submitting an assessment to having the final interview and running background checks almost within 48 hours,” she says. “I certainly don’t think you lose anything just because you can’t shake that person’s hand. I ask the same questions to a candidate that I would if they were sitting right in front of me. For me, nothing changes – I try to extract the information that I need to be assured that this is the right person for the job: can I see this person working with us, working with our clients? Do they give me confidence?”While recruiters may prefer to do the first round of remote interviews over the phone, Wilson says it is important to see the person you’re speaking to at some stage in the process. That doesn’t have to be via a bespoke HR platform – video conference tools such as Zoom, Skype, and Microsoft Teams work just as well. “If they’re going to be working remotely, you also need to be reassured they have the right set-up at home,” she adds. “I check that they have a dedicated desk area, they have an appropriate seat, and it looks free from distraction.”Candidates and interviewers alike should switch on all equipment 15 minutes beforehand, think about getting the lighting and camera angle right, test microphones, and put phones and any push notifications on silent, says flexible working consultant and executive coach Marilyn Devonish. “When speaking, look directly into the camera so the other person feels like you’re looking at them,” she adds, rather than getting distracted by your own image on the screen (Zoom has a “hide myself” option, which can help). She recommends interviewees also do a practice run-through with friends or family: “Think about making sure your personality comes out. So if you’re going for a job that needs a motivated self-starter, that’s what you’ve got to be when you’re on camera.” Candidates interviewed by video also have the luxury of being able to use printouts of the job description and any other reference notes without the interviewer’s knowledge.Recruiters should be mindful of including more visual and linguistic cues than they might use in person to show they’re following what the candidate is saying. “Things like saying ‘right’, ‘OK’, ‘great’,” Devonish adds. “If the sound drops, this is not the time to be scared or too polite – say: ‘I’m sorry, I missed that.’ Both sides need to make sure they can hear each other clearly.” A clear explanation for how the process will work should also be provided in good time, including the necessary passwords and access links. And always have a plan B. “Let them have a telephone number so that if the technology fails, they can call you. And if something does go wrong, watch how the candidate reacts – if they completely lose their head, that actually tells you a little bit about how they operate under pressure.”Stone believes the Covid-19 lockdown could mark a seismic shift in the way companies operate going forward. “This episode has proven that you don’t have to stop in your entirety when something like this does occur,” he says. “We’ve got some clients who are interviewing remotely and then onboarding new recruits by video too, just having a laptop delivered to their house. They’re hiring highly skilled people having never met them in their lives.”If you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiters.the and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit our jobsite"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4756bddd003771413a1abc4d879761ca80c2b648/0_110_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c603eb4f14b12e711c02d715347309f","title":"i dont know how i lived without the great british bake off cobie smulders lockdown tv","story":"The star of How I Met Your Mother and Stumptown on the heartwarming camaraderie on Bake Off and Prue Leith’s delightfully funky glasses and earring combinationsI am very grateful to your country for producing The Great British Bake Off.

We binged the last three seasons as a family and we can’t get enough.I don’t watch a ton of television so this has been the first time I’ve been able to catch up on things people have recommended, such as Killing Eve, Fleabag and now Bake Off.

I’m always excited about whatever you guys are making over there.The contestants on Bake Off are really next level, though.

She is somebody who seems to really enjoy tasting food, not just eating it. So if she tastes something that she likes, she gets tickled by it, she gets all bright and bubbly and you can just tell that it’s her joy to taste the perfect flavour combination – her enthusiasm is infectious. Her funky glasses and earring combinations are also delightful.What I maybe enjoy the most about it though, compared with US competitions, is that all the competitors are so kind. They really root for each other and there’s this camaraderie. They seem so invested in their successes and so excited to create something delicious.

A wave of brown British screenwriters is emerging too – notably Nida Manzoor, whose forthcoming series Lady Parts follows a group of Muslim women in a band (the pilot was excellent).But there were also those representations that were completely lacking, such as the titular character in The Mindy Project. As the writer and star of The Mindy Project, from 2012 to 2017, Kaling played Mindy Lahiri, a doctor dealing with silly, engaging romantic dramas. For almost the entire series, her ethnicity was incidental – something she was reprimanded for constantly during the show’s run, with people upset that the lead character only dated white men with no discussion of race Lahiri aspired to blonde women with blue eyes and begrudgingly dealt with the dated concept of being a “coconut”.To her credit, in writing Never Have I Ever, Kaling has taken on board some of the criticism. In one episode, Devi tries to make fun of people who are “Indian-Indian” at the Hindu festival Ganesh Puja and is met with derision, while her formerly equally cynical friend returns from college with new enthusiasm for his culture. He tells Devi: “Am I going to be this insecure Indian guy who hates doing Indian things? Because that’s its own identity. It’s just a shitty one.”Often, the show takes well-worn tropes and sets them on unusual ground. In one scene Kamala, Devi’s live-in cousin, is video-calling the family of a prospective arranged-marriage partner downstairs, while Devi is in her bedroom with her mates reading up on sex positions. It’s refreshing, when so often the narrative surrounding South Asian women and sex is shame. Devi’s mum, Nalini, disapproves of her daughter dating, instead wanting her to focus on academia – but she’s also learning to deal with parenting alone. She’s grieving for her husband, riding his motorcycle along the Malibu coast. While the “Indian” accents can be dubious, there is depth afforded to these women that goes beyond stereotypes.Nalini is also surprisingly accommodating about Kamala’s secret boyfriend, while Kamala immediately pushes back when said secret boyfriend assumes that arranged marriage is oppressive. The lack of dialogue around caste is very telling, though, and has seen the show come under fire online. It is the privilege of those of us who are from upper-caste backgrounds to be able to ignore it – at best, no discussion of caste on the show is a tacit acknowledgement of that. But it seems a cop-out to not mention a huge source of disparity and discrimination even in diaspora, not least when it comes to marriage.Another cause for controversy is the character Jaya, who is ostracised by the community for having married a Muslim. This is certainly steeped in reality, however, it strikes me as unlikely that no one would call this out – at wider family gatherings such prejudice often causes big arguments. Moreover, when anti-Muslim rhetoric and action has become a troubling part of Indian politics, a throwaway line or two as if to say “that’s just how it is” feels irresponsible.In 2017, Aamna Mohdin (now a  journalist) wrote for Quartz and article headlined: “It’s not Mindy Kaling’s job to explain racism and sexism to you”, arguing that it is exhausting for women of colour to be expected to constantly engage in discourse. Vice also noted Kaling might have felt precarious speaking about race as one of very few Indian people working in her industry. Artists Riz Ahmed and MIA have also discussed the pressure to speak for all South Asians. “We’re expected to carry the burden of representation for our whole communities and I don’t want to,” Ahmed said.Of course, it’s unfair to expect so much from Kaling – she should be allowed to tell whatever stories she wants, without every aspect being subject to scrutiny. Everyone is, like Devi, messy, imperfect and problematic – and, hopefully, constantly learning. Even so, the reality is there are few South Asian voices being afforded this kind of limelight in the west, and accordingly a lot of responsibility lies on Kaling’s shoulders. She might be telling her own story as a well-off south Indian Hindu, but it will largely be perceived, unhelpfully, as a much wider story about brownness. Moving forward, the show should be more mindful when considering community issues beyond a white gaze. More generally in the TV industry, it’s necessary to bring in a much wider range of screenwriters from the wealth of vastly different South Asian experiences.Regardless, I can’t help but think shy, romcom-loving teenage me might have been emboldened seeing a brown girl in a high school series living fully and loudly, holding and navigating her heritage alongside everything else. But for more of us to feel seen, we need South Asian stories from different socioeconomic backgrounds, castes, religions, skin tones, sexualities and countries moving forward. Ideally with plenty of sweet, predictable grand romantic gestures.Never Have I Ever is available on Netflix"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8d496288700e52a96c8cc386033b69f4e2b1c35/0_225_4935_2961/master/4935.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2157edcf2ca9d4d052b8f9ceb570510","title":"coronavirus loud neighbors community lockdown","story":"Locked-down Americans are learning more than they ever wanted to know about their neighbors. But the disease is building socially distant bonds, tooOne day a month into quarantine, Christie was leading a Zoom board meeting of the local political club where she’s president when the floor in the unit directly above started creaking. It was just as she feared: her upstairs neighbor had decided to engage in loud intimate activities.“I just sat there waiting to see if anyone said anything,” she said from her San Diego apartment. “They couldn’t hear it. But it was so distracting and made me so anxious.”Now she’s looking fearfully ahead to the next Zoom meeting she’s slated to lead with the full club, which will feature 30 to 60 people, including elected officials. “The thought of that happening again during it scares me a lot,” she said. “I need to ask how thick the walls are next time I move.”Americans are spending more time than ever at home and that means redefining relationships with neighbors – for better and, sometimes, for worse.In cities, parties in apartment buildings that were once merely a nuisance may seem suddenly nefarious, imbued with the potential to unleash contagion. And disturbances like a baby crying or a particularly thunderous living-room dance-off can quickly drive the best-intentioned neighbors to despair.One 47-year-old mom of two in Minneapolis said a neighbor’s birthday party recently prompted her to call the police. “Seeing them all gathering, not caring about social distancing, I actually started to cry,” she said. “Each one person that doesn’t care causes a ripple effect. It’s going to be a tsunami sooner or later.”Even slovenly dress has become a point of contention in certain communities.A Maryland police department recently entreated local residents to put on pants before retrieving mail. And on NextDoor, the social media network that connects neighbors and is known as a place for petty complaints, one user asked neighbors not to leave the house in pajamas.“You don’t have to dress to the nines but please consider clean, neat casual clothes … women maybe do a bit of makeup,” a Richmond, Virginia, resident named Jerry recently wrote in a post. “Just because we are experiencing a crisis we don’t have to be slobs.”One Bay Area resident posted on Nextdoor that, after witnessing a neighbor purchasing large bags of Clorox wipes, they rooted through the trash to ensure the neighbor was throwing them away rather than flushing them down the toilet. (Evidently they were concerned for the building’s plumbing.)And coronavirus has also brought neighborly connections to new heights. Italy’s balcony singalongs have been repeated around the globe and across the country, from Boston to Indianapolis to Wichita, Kansas and San Jose, California. Residents of Marin county, California, have organized a nightly howling.Harriet Riley, a writing instructor in New Orleans, was at first distraught about the prospect of having to cancel her annual crawfish boil, a beloved Louisiana tradition. That is, until she realized there was still a way to connect.“We set up a long table at the end of our driveway with the four ice chests of crawfish,” she said, and each family had just one designated person approach. “Everyone took their crawfish to their front porches and we laughed and yelled around to each other. We also saw some neighbors that we don’t see as often. The crawfish really brought everyone out.”Such interactions mark a surprising shift. A pre-Covid report found that only about a fifth of Americans regularly spent time with their neighbors, while a third said they had never interacted with those living next door to them. It’s a steep drop from several decades ago, when a third of Americans spent time with their neighbors twice a week or more.Now even the barter economy is enjoying a boost. Sandra Choute, a special education department chair within the Maryland public school system, found herself making a deal with a neighbor in her complex who works as a nursing assistant and lacked supplies to mend a mask.“She needed needles and thread,” Choute said. “I made her a small sewing kit and she gave me gloves and masks.”Choute’s relationships with neighbors have gotten deeper, she added. Casual chit-chat from her balcony can easily turn emotional, as it did recently when a neighbor in the grass below explained how an aunt in New York was battling both cancer and Covid at once. “She’s in tears and I’m just trying to talk to her, trying to lift her spirits,” Choute recalled.It can be easy, while complaining about or praising one’s neighbors, to forget that you are also a neighbor yourself, as Hillary, a communications specialist from Cincinnati, discovered recently.“My downstairs neighbor is definitely still having hookups,” she said a few weeks ago. “Should I call the police, or … ?”But when the  circled back a week later, Hillary was in higher spirits. She and a different neighbor from down the hall had started dating.“The tables have turned,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfef76e42da6298d528fb31c11e6361facff69f7/0_1_4981_2989/master/4981.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b7f41c0deffe24243d2ee99dc2404ad","title":"are you planning to return to your workplace on wednesday","story":"If you’re preparing to go back to work – away from home – we’d like to hear from you.

The country reported no new cases or deaths on Tuesday.While many are relishing the prospect of resuming their normal lives – and economists are sighing with relief that the economy can kick back into life – a small sense of anxiety is growing among some at what will be a very altered version of New Zealand’s “normal”.Strangers are being asked to keep their distance from one another, and social gatherings are capped at 10. Many workplaces and public transport will operate in shifts to satisfy social distancing requirements, and up to a third of small businesses may be forced to close their doors for good, unable to recover from the lockdown.Dr Dougal Sutherland, a clinical psychologist at Victoria University of Wellington, said for many, fears of catching the virus may flare up with the loosened restrictions, while others may feel they have become rusty when it comes to basic social skills such as friendships, dating and interacting with colleagues.“The announcement of moving to Level 2 will bring a sense of relief for many. However, for a significant number the return to work and school may bring about a return of worry and anxiety,” Sutherland said.“Despite the obvious downsides, Levels 3 and 4 did bring a sense of protection and security for some who suffer from anxiety. As we emerge from the shadows of strict lockdown old fears about becoming unwell may reappear. Triggers for anxiety that have lain dormant for weeks, such as the fear of social evaluation by others, may arise again.”With many having lost their jobs or been forced to take pay cuts, Level 2 may also drive home the stark reality of the social and economic consequences of the pandemic, Sutherland said.“Breaking out of our bubbles may bring with it feelings of loss, shame, and guilt as we come face-to-face with these harsh realities and have to front up to others.”Ardern has urged Kiwis to think of Level 2 as “the new normal” an idea Dr Hiran Thabrew a child psychiatrist and paediatrician at the University of Auckland, agrees with. Thabrew said if expectations were too high, some people could struggle with the ongoing requirements for social distancing and stringent hygiene practices.“We are not going back to business as usual,” associate professor Bernard Walker of the business and law school at the University of Canterbury said. “We may be only nanoseconds away from the chaos and grief overseas.”Anxiety about returning to life post-lockdown is a global experience, with reports of similar feelings emerging among populations in Italy, Spain, France, Australia and the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64d3696319dbd7d3fde425f620ac617f6644ddbb/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=514e25796b2cd1f0b91c0faa29bac0c0","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance ","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:Bars, restaurants, hairdressing and beauty salons will reopen across Italy from 18 May.

This is essential,” the EU home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, told MEPs last week.Separately, Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron were said to be working on a deal that could allow their citizens to travel freely between the UK and France over the summer.The UK prime minister and French president were reported by the Sun newspaper to be working on a travel corridor, aimed at allowing British tourists to visit France in the summer and vice versa.Keeping the corridor open would depend on both countries maintaining a downward trend in coronavirus cases and a similar rate of contagion. The agreement would also apply to Ireland, which is part of a common travel area with the UK.The British government has exempted travellers from France from having to go into a 14-day quarantine that will apply to most international visitors. But for now citizens of both countries are being advised not to travel to holiday homes.By the peak summer season, travellers across the EU will be able to check an interactive map drawn up by the European commission’s science service that will provide information on the latest border controls and travel conditions, under the commission plans. The EU executive will also call on member states to construct preparedness plans in case of a second wave of coronavirus.The World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on face masks has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers – not the public.\u0026nbsp“Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” the WHO has stated.Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.\u0026nbspThere is no robust scientific evidence – in the form of trials – that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.Also underlying the WHO’s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play if everyone wears them.The commission has pledged to prioritise tourism in an EU recovery plan that is still being worked on.Meanwhile, the commission has declined to back a call by more than a dozen EU member states calling for a relaxation of passenger rights rules that would allow cash-starved airlines to reimburse people with vouchers rather than money for cancelled flights.The commission is expected to say customers should retain the right to a cash refund, but will propose common rules for vouchers to make them as attractive as possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c672da680b07750906793ffc6d2aec45ed9ea5b/57_0_1087_652/master/1087.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54459831484bf5e6dea3cb228e7cc247","title":"matt hancock tries to clear up confusion over coronavirus advice","story":"Summer holidays are likely to be cancelled this year, the health secretary warned, as he said the public need to prepare for the “reality of life” in a period of physical distancing.Matt Hancock appeared on ITV’s This Morning just 24 hours after the government was severely criticised by the presenter Phillip Schofield for its messaging on how the country would leave the lockdown.In their exchange, Hancock said it was “likely to be the case” that summer holidays were effectively cancelled.The minister also clarified it was possible to see one parent and then another outdoors “10 minutes apart” but that giving people social hugs would only be possible after a treatment or vaccine would be found, which at the earliest could be in the autumn.“We will seek to reopen hospitality from early July if we keep successfully reducing the spread of this virus but I think social distancing of some kind is going to continue,” Hancock said.“And the conclusion from that is that it’s unlikely big lavish international holidays are going to be possible for this summer. I just think that’s a reality of life.”The government has been criticised for the way it has handled the communication around its roadmap out of lockdown plan, with a televised address by the prime minister giving the impression people should return to work if possible from Monday. It emerged later changes are due on Wednesday.Johnson is also under fire for not announcing the strategy first in parliament.Hancock batted away suggestions the government’s messaging on the way out of lockdown had been confusing for the public, and said: “I’m here to try to make sure that everybody understands as best as possible what we’re trying to achieve. I think we were quite clear.”He said his constituents “get it” but admitted he thought it best to go on the daytime TV show in person after watching the criticism levelled at the government on Monday.Earlier he said social “bubbles” that allow for two households in England to mix should soon help with the “anguish” of not being able to see family members.In a round of broadcast interviews, he said the government had to draw a line somewhere when limiting social contact, and one-to-one meetings outdoors was a reasonable way to “protect everybody against that burgeoning into large groups of people”.He said it was sensible to limit such meetings to public places rather than private gardens, because the latter could require people to walk through one another’s houses, which was less safe.Hancock also tried to explain why childminders were being allowed to go back to work but people could not rely on their relatives for childcare. “For some people’s livelihoods they need a childminder in order to earn an income and so that is important we allow that to happen,” he said.“But at the same time we don’t want to encourage the large scale, we don’t want to encourage people, especially when grandparents are older, and we know this virus kills more older people than younger people, so we don’t want to encourage kids to stay with their grandparents, but we do want to allow people, where possible, to get back to work.”Johnson has been criticised for failing to acknowledge the pain felt by people being kept apart from their wider families, despite the guidance being very slightly changed to allow one-to-one contact between members of different households outdoors.Hancock said he understood people were upset about not being able to see relatives and partners and signalled that further loosening of the rules in the coming weeks would help to address that.He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It will help if we can do it in a way that doesn’t impact on R. I think it will help with this anguish of a lot of people wanting to see family members in another household, whether that’s a grandparent – although there are the risks for older grandparents – or for people who are in a relationship but are in different households, and I understand that yearning as well.”Hancock also defended the policy of allowing people to drive to beauty spots, despite concerns about the potential for crowds to gather. He said there should not be a problem if “people socially distance when they get there, and hence we’ve kept the socially distancing rules very clearly in place”, adding: “This isn’t for people to move house or to go on holiday or to be able to stay.”There is concern about the prospect of being encouraged to go back to work from Wednesday when guidance on safety standards is only being published on Tuesday.The health secretary refused to directly answer whether people had a legal right not to go to work if they did not feel safe due to coronavirus, when twice asked on BBC Breakfast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/443a50ed6bd72f311480e43f6073571881b150d4/0_111_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1db2ba23188b8744cdf1ab372daee6df","title":"uk commuters share your photos and experiences of travelling to work lockdown","story":"What it is like to travel to work at the moment?

The wave of infections also spread from the hospitals to the old people’s homes, which could also have been avoided. The government is now trying to pretend to the public that it has the situation under control.”Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung acknowledged the UK’s special context: “The prime minister may be credited with having to fight a harder struggle than some other heads of government. Britain (and London in particular) is particularly vulnerable. As a former colonial power and Europe’s air hub, it is in close contact with the world. Many Britons live in metropolitan areas where the virus spreads faster. With the state’s National Health Service, the nation has also given itself a health system that is cumbersome, bureaucratic and has been underfunded for some time.”It predicted: “Once the nation has returned to normal, more citizens than before may question faith in British exceptionalism. That will not immediately drive them back into the arms of the European Union. But it could at least increase pressure on the Johnson government to prolong trade talks with the EU and not to fail with a gesture of arrogance.”The Spanish newspaper El País reported the UK government’s strategy had generated confusion and anger among citizens, businessmen and the self-employed.It claimed Johnson had always known how to pitch his speech to the character of the British and tell them what they wanted to hear. “Or at least make them smile. Until now.”In an editorial, Le Monde, the leading French daily, described Britain’s new slogan as cringeworthy, given the UK had recorded the worst mortality figures in Europe.Its news report suggested the UK itself was “fading” and added: “Despite Europe’s worst mortality, probably too late entry into confinement and a blatant lack of preparation, the British have so far supported Johnson.”The Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant also challenged the UK performance: “According to many, testing, testing, testing is the motto. That has hardly happened in the UK for weeks, losing sight of the spread of the virus. This gap shows that the British were insufficiently prepared for the pandemic, despite the presence of expertise in this area. The country has been catching up in recent weeks. Much of the harm has already been done.”The Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet criticised Johnson’s ambiguity while the New York Times said many had been left baffled, adding: “His proposals had run into a barrage of opposition, as critics pointed to gaps and contradictions in a plan that left many pondering basic questions such as when to return to work and how to get there.”The Wall Street Journal, owned by Rupert Murdoch, was more sympathetic, saying the UK faced the same trade-offs as countries worldwide, but warned: “It’s quickly becoming a bigger political challenge for Prime Minister Boris Johnson than Brexit.”Tom Fletcher, a former British diplomat and a great student of the soft power league table, recently wrote: “This will be a defining period for national identities, as many of us are more attuned to what is happening globally and have more time to absorb it.“The reputation of nations has been put under the microscope. Were they efficient in responding? How did their populations react? Were they led by reason or emotion? What did they prioritise in the response? All of that will resonate for years in the league tables of soft power. There will be winners and losers”.It is hard as it stands to see the UK bidding for the title."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2fc73475d90179adb95ed656929228329ffb406/0_99_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f830372cd338e3c1b341f9bbda59eee1","title":"what is the future for travel and immigration in age of covid 19","story":"Lockdowns are starting to ease but travel and migration will be disrupted for longerOur globalised world has been brought to a crashing halt by coronavirus.And while local lockdowns are starting to ease in many countries now, the pause on international travel is likely to last far longer. With countries still focused on staving off a second wave of infections, there is little appetite for rapid reopening.“Travel and immigration – for work, study, seeking asylum – is going to be disrupted much longer than our daily lives, in a way unprecedented in our lifetimes,” said Prof Lindsay Wiley from the American University Washington College of Law.Senior figures in the aviation industry have already said they expect it to be several years before passenger demand returns to 2019 levels, if it ever does.Greece’s tourism minister, Harry Theoharis, recently told the  that although the country is desperate to protect its economy, long-haul flights to its islands and beaches are almost certainly out this year.Countries that acted fast to bring the disease under control – at least for now – are exploring ways to open up a limited “bubble” for their citizens to travel without restriction. The first to discuss the idea were New Zealand and Australia.Nine countries scattered across the world, but united in their successful handling of the virus are also actively seeking ways of setting up travel bubbles or corridors, broadening an unlikely alliance.In their second meeting via teleconference on Thursday, the leaders of Austria, Greece, Israel, Norway, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand agreed that as each begins to ease restrictions they could capitalise on low infection rates by creating tourism safe zones.Israel, Greece and Cyprus – tourist-dependent nations – are already discussing the idea in the eastern Mediterranean, and hoping to partially open up from July. On Wednesday the European commission is expected to recommend a three-phase approach to reopening borders that brings together member states with “similar overall risk profiles”.Any reopening would be very gradual however, with authorities prepared to shut back back down if the virus re-emerges.“A month in an epidemic is a very long time,” said Cyprus’ chief virologist professor Leondios Kostrikis.And beyond these bubbles, travel is likely to be severely curtailed either by outright bans, or by quarantine rules. The UK, a laggard on quarantining by international standards, outlined its own plans at the weekend. The incubation period of the disease means most countries are requiring two weeks isolation on arrival.If that is enforced in both departure and destination countries, it would mean a month under lockdown in total, in order for travellers to spend any time working or relaxing somewhere else – effectively putting an end to most business and tourism travel.These partial or total closures, while they may protect public health, come with a huge economic cost to countries dependent on tourism or other types of travel, like international students flying in for a university education. That burden might help attempts to reaccelerate opening of borders.“You can protect yourselves by isolating the entire jurisdiction, but then you have to think through how you restructure your whole economy if you aren’t going to allow travel.”Yet even partial, controlled re-opening to travel carries risks. The disease’s long incubation period means the most up-to-date information on current infections may still miss the latest clusters countries that seem disease free may be nursing fresh undetected infections.New York’s outbreak provides a recent example of how ineffective travel bans can be it appears to have been driven by cases from Italy, brought in after the US government halted entry of people coming from China but not from Europe.“My worry is that travel bans become a distraction from appropriately managing local transmission, that’s what happened in the US, where we could have had a policy of ‘test trace, isolate’, and the focus was on the travel bans instead,” said Alex Phelan, professor at Georgetown University Centre for Global Health, Science and Security.“As it demonstrated, if you are going to be putting bans in place against countries, you are always going to be acting on data that is out of date.”And no travel ban is absolute global supply chains mean people will continue travelling to transport goods, and most land borders are somewhat porous, so viruses can slip across with smuggled goods.“We human beings often have tried to forestall epidemics by shuttering, by drawing up the drawbridge, and there is no question that travel can spread some types of disease. But it’s also much harder than we imagine to contain,” said Wendy Parmet professor of law, public policy and urban affairs at Northeastern University.“This virus is extraordinarily contagious. New Zealand is an island (nation), they may be the one place that can. I certainly don’t think the US can, or the countries on the Eurasian continent can.”Other options to try to restart travel before a vaccine is developed could include tests shortly before travel either for antibodies to prove immunity, or for the disease itself to prevent infected people travelling.There is precedent for requiring either immunity or virus-free status for travel travellers coming from places with yellow fever are required to have a vaccination certificate for the disease to enter countries from Australia to India and Mexico.At a time of concern about the climate impact of flying, there are suggestions that some of the slide in travel could and should become permanent. And some businesses are already embracing the savings in costs and carbon that have been forced on them.France has said its bailout of national carrier Air France will be dependent on the airline eliminating short domestic flights where the trip could be made by train.And the enforced end of travel may change expectations around business travel in a positive way, said Prof James Faulconbridge, head of the Department of Organisation, Work and Technology at Lancaster University.“Many of those meetings never needed to happen through travel anyway, but there was a sort of expectation, a working practice that associated travel and going to meet people as a way of doing business, a sign of commitment.”Mass international travel only emerged a couple of decades ago it is possible that habits could change dramatically again.“Its easy to forget that it was only around the turn of the century that levels of travel we now accept as normal started to emerge,” he said. “So a reset that changes our presumption around travel is not as radical as it might appear.”"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

This was because vitamin D deficiency was common among those at risk of Covid-19 (particularly older people) there was no toxic risk from taking it at the recommended dosage level, and growing evidence of benefits.Last week, scientists at Northwestern University in the US found those with severe vitamin D deficiency were twice as likely to experience Covid-19 complications.If changing advice led to a rush of products on sale in shops, “it is not a reason not to take it . . . This is no time to hang around”, she added.“While there are currently no results from randomised controlled trials to conclusively prove that vitamin D beneficially affects Covid-19 outcomes, there is strong circumstantial evidence of associations between vitamin D and the severity of Covid-19 responses, including death.”Daily sunshineIn England, Scotland and Wales, public health bodies have revised recommendations since the Covid-19 outbreak to say all adults should take at least 400 IU (international units) of vitamin D daily.Prof Kenny said most scientists would recommend between 800 and 1,000 IU – she takes the higher dose – and recommended older people be exposed to 10 to 15 minutes of sunshine daily, if possible.Vitamin D is produced in the skin from UVB sunlight exposure. It is changed into an active hormone that keeps the skeleton strong and free of osteoporosis. It is also contained in many foods, such as oily fish and cheese, while most people ensure they have adequate amounts through a combination of sunlight and a healthy diet.Controversially, US president Donald Trump suggested zapping the virus with sunlight or UV but this was not related to the vitamin D connection in boosting the immune system.In response to the study, a Department of Health spokeswoman said the National Public Health Emergency Team which advises the Government on Covid-19, “keeps all national and international evidence and advice under continuous review as the basis for any recommendations”.Cytokine stormsThe TCD data, produced in collaboration with Prof Jon Rhodes at the University of Liverpool, suggests it is likely to reduce serious Covid-19 complications. “This may be because vitamin D is important in regulation and suppression of the inflammatory cytokine response, which causes the severe consequences of Covid-19 and ‘acute respiratory distress syndrome’ associated with ventilation and death,” Prof Kenny explained.Cytokine storms seem to kill a majority of Covid-19 patients, and not destruction of the lungs by the virus itself.This study shows – counterintuitively – countries at lower latitude and typically sunny countries, such as Spain and northern Italy, had low concentrations of vitamin D and high rates of deficiency. These countries also experienced the highest Covid infection and death rates in Europe.Northern latitude countries (Norway, Finland and Sweden) have higher vitamin D levels despite less UVB sunlight exposure, because supplementation and fortification of foods is more common. These countries have lower Covid infection and death rates.Vitamin D deficiency is common in Ireland and is most prevalent with age, obesity, in men, in ethnic minorities, in people with diabetes, hypertension and in nursing homes.Dr Laird said: “Optimising vitamin D intake to public health guidelines will certainly have benefits for overall health and support immune function. Research like this is still exploratory and we need further trials to have concrete evidence on the level of vitamin D that is needed for optimal immune function.“Supplementation is the best means of ensuring sufficient vitamin D blood levels. As the effects of coronavirus continue, many of us are limited in the time we can spend outdoors, so extra care is required to keep vitamin D levels healthy.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"The  would like to hear about your summer plans, and hopes for next yearFianna F\u0026aacuteil leader says country needs government making long-term decisionsWinner yet to come forward to claim prize after buying ticket in Talty\u0026rsquos Mace Circle KEasing of measures to be \u0026lsquoled by science and not by the calendar\u0026rsquo as part of new roadmapFrench authorities asking to see legal submissions from State and Ian Bailey, lawyer saysCommittee will scrutinise and review actions of State and other agencies in dealing with pandemicHarris concerned about study showing high percentage who think worst of pandemic is overOrganisation warns global pandemic means a likely drop in overseas recruitmentArchbishop Diarmuid Martin says churches should begin \u0026lsquopreparing a detailed plan\u0026rsquoMany left comments saying they donated in remembrance of aid to Ireland during FaminePhase one of Government\u0026rsquos roadmap to reopen society is scheduled to begin on MondayGirl treated in hospital for non-life-threatening injuries on Monday eveningAlso, outbreak of coronavirus in Dundalk nursing home has \u0026lsquostabilised\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash managementFears of \u0026lsquosporadic outbreaks\u0026rsquo if turnaround times do not improve before people return to workProcess takes average of nine days says HSE, but experts say this must be within 72 hours to stop spread of virusTII warns of limited available funding due to prior commitments and ongoing projectsIt seems like Groundhog Day with continuing delays in Covid-19 testing and contact tracingMental Health Commission criticises \u0026lsquoinconsistencies\u0026rsquo in staff testing for Covid-19Dublin archdiocese facing mounting financial crisis with priests\u0026rsquo wages cut by a quarterFine Gael and Fianna F\u0026aacuteil leaders outline commitment in letter to Labour leaderStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4251380.1589276818!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"beyond amazing navajo nation s ag praises irish generosity to coronavirus fund","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMonument Valley is home to the Navajo Nation, who have been badly affected by coronavirus. Photograph: Eric BaradatAFPIrish people’s generosity in helping Native Americans fight one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in the United States has been described as “beyond amazing” by the Navajo Nation’s attorney general Doreen McPaul. Hundreds of thousands of dollars poured in to the Navajo \u0026amp Hopi Families Covid-19 Relief Fund since it began to go viral in Ireland, helping it burst through its target of $1.5 million (€1.3 million) last week.The list of donors to the GoFundMe page is dominated by Irish surnames, and many donors left comments to say they were giving in remembrance of Native American aid to Ireland during the Great Hunger.In 1847, members of the Choctaw tribe raised $170 in famine relief for Ireland, a huge sum for a time when they had very little, as it came after they had been driven from their land in the devastating so-called Trail of Tears.Many comments on the GoFundMe page referenced the Choctaw donation. Some read “Ní neart go cur le chéile” and others simply “Ireland remembers”. “173 years ago, the people of the Choctaw nation showed Ireland unimaginable generosity,” wrote donor Michael Foy. “I am donating today in memory of our shared past, and to help overcome this crisis together – just as we did nearly two centuries ago.”The Nation’s attorney general Doreen McPaul who has Irish grandfathers, told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland on Tuesday that it was “just really heart-warming” when she learned of the many donations from Irish people. “It made me want to follow up more,” she said. Both of her paternal grandfathers were Irish and her father has dual citizenship, she said. Ms McPaul has visited Ireland twice as her sister lived in Ireland while she studied international human rights.Her sister subsequently married an Irish man, from Newmarket-on-Fergus in Co Clare and they visit Ireland every summer along with her parents.The fundraiser was organised by a group of Native American women who are community organisers, and have set up a network of distribution points for food, water, and soap. The supplies are essential given that 38 per cent of people in the reservation live in poverty, and providing them helps the most vulnerable people to stay protected in their homes.The funds raised will be used to help members of the Navajo Nation which is spread across three states - Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. With a population of 170,000, to date 132 people have died from the pandemic. Communities have found coping with the virus “problematic” because of the infrastructure with many living in remote areas. Just 13 grocery stores serve an area larger than the Republic, and the Navajo estimate they have only 170 hospital beds. A third of homes do not have running water, and the legacy of US uranium mining in the territory to build its nuclear arsenal has left groundwater contaminated, making basic hygiene difficult.It is also difficult to separate an ill person from the remainder of the family as they live in multi-generational households and it was not part of the Navajo culture not to care for someone. There are also challenges with a lack of water and access to disinfectant. Ms McPaul said she first became aware of the generosity of the Irish people when the treasurer of the fund shared with her some of the comments of Irish donors. She had already been aware of the Choctaw story and of the sculpture in Ireland. “It is beyond amazing, the outpouring of support from Ireland is amazing,” she said. The Choctaw aid, which is remembered by the Kindred Spirits sculpture by Alex Pentek in Midleton, Co Cork, is not the only example of solidarity between Irish people and Native Americans in history.In a mission to drum up support for Irish independence in the US in 1919, future president Éamon de Valera was made an honorary chief by the Ojibwe-Chippewa tribe, who greeted him as “a representative of one oppressed nation to another”, according to a contemporary news report.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4251513.1589285963!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus five stage plan for exiting lockdown published in north","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFirst minister Arlene Foster (left) and Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill arrive at Stormont prior to announcing the Executive’s approach to coronavirus decision-making. Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA WireNorthern Ireland will begin its exit from coronavirus lockdown starting with people encouraged to return to their workplace and ending with the opening of restaurants, cafes and pubs, it was announced on Tuesday.First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill outlined in the Northern Assembly on Tuesday their five-stage plan for ending the coronavirus restrictions.Unlike the Republic, the recovery plan does not set out dates for each of the five steps. Executing the steps will be “led by science and not by the calendar”.Ms Foster and Ms O’Neill made clear that moving from stage to stage will hinge on the level of the transmission remaining below R1 – the level of transmission of the illness, also known as Covid-19, which currently at 0.8 in the North - and the capacity of the health and social care services to deal with the virus.STEP 1In step one people who are unable to work from home will be encouraged to return to work on a phased basis.Large outdoor retails centres such as garden centres will be allowed open.Groups of four to six people can meet outdoors subject to social distancing and, with the exception of people who are shielding, visits to immediate family will be allowed indoors, again where distancing is being followed.Drive through church services will be permitted and churches can be open for private prayer.Outdoor spaces and public sport amenities are to open while people can undertake activities such as walking, running, cycling, golf and tennis and some water activities. Drive through cinemas also can open.STEP 2Non-food retail stores can open while groups of up to 10 can meet outdoors. Team sports training can resume on a non-contact basis in small groups.Indoor activities involving limited contact of less than 10 minutes in duration will be permitted. Outdoor activities of less than 10 minutes involving small groups of less than 10 people where it may be difficult to maintain social distancing will be permitted.Selected libraries and open-air museums can open.Public transport will continue but in order to avoid crowded trains and buses people will be encouraged to walk and cycle for short journeys.The definition of “key workers” will be extended so that more children of these workers can attend school.STEP 3There will be a phased return to office and onsite work.On a part-time basis more children of “priority cohorts” will attend school.In terms of family and community there can be gatherings of up to 30 people where distancing is maintained.Indoor activities involving “larger” numbers of iniduals who do not share a household connection will be allowed.There will be a resumption of team sports training on a non-contact basis museums, galleries and libraries will open and concert and theatre rehearsals will start again.STEP 4More retail centres can open such as hairdressers, fitness studios and tattoopiercing businesses.Schools will open for all children “on a part time basis with a blended learning approach involving a combination of in-school and remote learning”.A wider range of gatherings will be permitted including church services. There will be a resumption of competitive sports behind closed doors or “with limitations on the number of spectators”.Leisure centres and other indoor facilities will open and outdoor concerts will be allowed on a restricted basis.STEP 5Everybody expected to return to work with remote working still strongly encouraged and maintained where possible.Restaurants, cafes and pubs can open “subject to risk assessment, on a limited basis to start with”.Early years schools provision to be expanded to full-time basis.Public transport operating a full service but “subject to ongoing risk assessment”.People can meet in extended groups subject to social distancing.There will be a resumption of close physical contact sports a return to competitive sport and full use of sporting facilities spectators can attend live events on a restricted basis and nightclubs and concerts can resume on a limited basis.Indoor gatherings of large numbers, and or more than ten minutes, where social distancing cannot be easily maintained, will be permitted.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4251477.1589283538!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus martin calls for test and trace system to be considerably shortened","story":"The World Health Organization (WHO) says extreme vigilance is needed as countries begin to exit from coronavirus lockdowns to avoid a second wave of infections.

Photograph:  Brian LawlessPA WireWhen asked about the statistics for Covid-19 in other countries Mr Martin said he was not one for pillorying others, but that lessons could be learned from other countries.“We are not where we need to be yet for the reopening of the economy,” he told Newstalk’s Pat Kenny Show on Tuesday morning. The median time from referring a person for a test to sending the result for contact tracing is five days, according to David Walsh, HSE national director of community operations.The average time taken to then trace all the contacts of a confirmed case is four days, Mr Walsh told a National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) briefing, although “straightforward” cases are dealt with more quickly.Mr Walsh said this was “an improving figure” and would shorten with the automation of the process in relation to negative results.Prof Mary Codd, an epidemiologist at University College Dublin (UCD) and head of the contact tracing centre on the campus, said it was vital test results for Covid-19 were turned around within 48 hours by the time people return to work next week.The entire testing process must come to within 48 hours, or certainly no longer than 72, in order to cut out the spread of the virus in the population, she said. “Otherwise actually we are likely to be looking at these sporadic outbreaks that may not be able to be contained.”The process of sampling, testing, communication of results to a positive case, contact tracing and quarantine of contacts needs to be done within 72 hours, immunologist Dr Tomas Ryan of Trinity College Dublin has also said.The Mental Health Commission said on Monday that mental health services in Cork and Kerry, and south Dublin, were awaiting test results from up to two weeks ago, while services in the northwest, southeast and south DublinKildare were waiting more than a week.On Monday, the president of the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP), Dr Mary Favier, said last month test turnaround times were often more than two weeks.Mr Walsh said the HSE’s target for testing turnaround times was “three days or below”. By the end of this week, the time it takes should be down to four days and process improvements would then be undertaken to reduce it further.The figure could also be improved if people experiencing symptoms responded earlier by seeking a test, according to Dr Holohan. He said an average of four days passed between the time a person experienced symptoms consistent with Covid-19 and the time a sample was taken.The deaths of another 15 patients were announced by NPHET at its briefing on Monday, the second-lowest figure in over six weeks. There have now been 1,467 Covid-19 related deaths in the Republic. Some 139 new cases of the disease were also reported, including 60 notifications in the past 24 hours. The new cases bring the total number of cases to 23,135.Department of Health Study Meanwhile, World Health Organisation (WHO) spokeswoman Dr Margaret Harris has said that all countries need to ramp up their Covid-19 testing and contact tracing as they are essential parts of the puzzle of coping with the virus.Dr Harris told RTÉ’s Today programme that masks were not the chief protection against the virus and the WHO had not said that they should be compulsory.Asked about research conducted for the Department of Health which indicated that 43 per cent of the Irish population believed the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic is over, she said the virus can continue to do “very, very bad things to us” if the public does not heed the warnings the virus has sent”.While staying at home was important, everyone would now have to learn to live in a new way that stops the virus from causing harm. Good overall hygiene, proper hand washing and social distancing continued to be important methods of protection, she said.Minister for Health Simon Harris has said he is “very concerned” about the Department of Health’s study. “I very much get it, this is something that’s been with us for quite a period of time,” he told the Dermot and Dave Show on Today FM on Tuesday. “We’ve seen a lot of progress made by people around the country, and as a result the country is in a much better place with this virus than it could have been. The Irish people have saved thousands of lives. However, that doesn’t mean that anybody can say that we’re through the worst of it because quite frankly, an awful lot is still not known about this virus. We need to mark the progress because we all need hope, but we can’t get a bit cocksure of ourselves because that would be really dangerous.” Mr Harris said he is hopeful about the easing of restrictions some of which are being lifted next Monday but said the next few weeks and months will depend a lot of inidual behaviour. He said he is concerned about “some anticipatory behaviour in advance of next week. If we start getting ahead of ourselves, the risk is that we’ll put the whole plan in jeopardy.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4251518.1589288603!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"independent michael mcnamara appointed chair of covid 19 committee","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael McNamara was propped up by Green Party TD Ossian SmythIndependent TD Michael McNamara has been appointed chair of the Covid-19 committee without a vote.

Photograph: Roslan RahmanAFP via Getty ImagesCoronavirus has infected nearly 4.2 million people and killed more than 286,500, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.Here are the latest updates on the pandemic from around the world:UKChancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to announce an extension to the furlough scheme for workers as the UK death toll linked to Covid-19 passed 40,000.New analysis puts the death toll at just over 40,000, following new figures on care home deaths released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).This includes deaths from Covid-19 and where it has been mentioned on the death certificate as a factor.It comes as Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed the new contact tracing app will be rolled out across England shortly and Mr Sunak will set out more detailed plans for the furlough scheme.At least 6.3 million people are currently having up to 80 per cent of their salaries paid by the taxpayer under the system at a cost of some £8 billion (€9.3bn).Mr Sunak has previously said he was preparing to “wean” workers and businesses off the programme — which currently runs until the end of June — but calls have been made for it to be prolonged.It has been reported the programme will continue to September, although the rate of support will be cut from a maximum of 80 per cent of salary to 60 per cent.Mr Hancock said on Tuesday that there would be no “cliff edge” to the furlough scheme, agreeing with the suggestion that it would somehow begin to taper down.He also confirmed that the contact tracing app being trialled on the Isle of Wight would now be rolled out across England in the next week or so.He told Sky News: “We’re rolling out in mid-May. The Isle of Wight project has gone well so far, we’ve learned a lot about how the app operates.“We’re pleased with progress, and we’re going to bring it in.”- Care home deaths accounted for some 40 per cent of coronavirus-related fatalities registered in England and Wales in the week ending May 1st, data from the Office for National Statistics showed.- Ministers have set out guidance for commuters using public transport, saying they should keep two metres apart from others “wherever possible”, wear a face covering, use contactless payments and avoid rush-hour.- Ryanair announced plans to return to 40 per cent of normal flight schedules from July 1st.He also confirmed that when people decided to meet one other person at a distance and outdoors, they should meet in parks and open spaces, not in their gardens.He said one of the reasons is that gardens can sometimes only be accessed through a house.Mr Hancock also said the household “bubble” idea will help relieve the “anguish” of people wanting to see their grandparents or partners.The UK Government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has been asked to look at the idea of a household “bubble” in the coming weeks, where one household is allowed to join up with and interact with one other household only.Mr Hancock said it may help relieve anxiety as long as it did not impact on pushing the reproductive rate of the virus — the R — above one.SPAINSpain has reported 176 new confirmed deaths for coronavirus during the past 24 hours, bringing the country’s total death toll to 26,920. New infections confirmed by laboratory tests are up on Tuesday by 426.The total contagion, including antibody tests, stands at 269,520. The figures were slightly up from a day before, but records usually see an increase on Tuesday as unreported data over the weekend shows up in official statistics.Nearly 140,000 people have recovered after contracting the virus, Spain’s Health Ministry said.Roughly half of Spaniards are starting to enjoy a looser version of the country’s stringent lockdown adopted in mid-March.Spain will require all visitors from abroad to quarantine for 14 days if they arrive in the country after May 15th.The new Health Ministry order, published in Spain’s official gazette, said the goal is to “limit the risks derived from the international traffic of people” during the rollback of the coronavirus lockdown.Travel agencies and transport companies must inform their customers about the new regulations before they sell their Spain-bound tickets, and airlines need to make sure that passengers fill out a “location card” in case they need to be contacted after their trip.Tourism-magnet Spain is starting to loosen the grip after seven weeks of strict confinement. Authorities have reported more than 26,700 deaths for coronavirus and over 268,000 infections confirmed by tests.FRANCEFrench children have started going back to school as the country gradually lifts confinement measures, following two months of lockdown.Authorities say 86 per cent of preschools and primary schools are reopening this week. Most schools across the country start accommodating children on Tuesday. In Paris, schools will reopen on Thursday.Classes are capped at 10 students at preschools and 15 elsewhere. Students are required to keep physical distance from each other and wash their hands several times a day. Teachers must wear a mask.School attendance is not compulsory. The government has allowed parents to keep children at home amid fears prompted by the Covid-19, as France is one of the hardest-hit countries in the world. A target date has not been scheduled yet for high schools.As of Tuesday, French authorities reported nearly 140,000 people infected with the virus and more than 26,000 deaths.BELGIUMBrussels Airlines has unveiled a cost-cutting plan that will result in the reduction of 25 per cent of its workforce.The Lufthansa subsidiary, which employs 4,000 people, has suspended its flights as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The carrier, which also suffered from the bankruptcy of travel operator Thomas Cook last year, plans to reduce its fleet from 54 to 38 aircraft as part of the restructuring.Brussels Airlines said it is losing €1million a day because of revenue losses, aircraft leasing and maintenance costs. The company has asked the government for €290million in aid.“While the turnaround plan is indispensable to overcome the crisis, the ongoing discussions with both the Belgian government and Lufthansa remain essential,” Brussels Airlines said.GREECEPolice in northern Greece say migrants at a holding site near the country’s border with Turkey have staged violent protests following weeks of delays in processing their asylum claims due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Authorities said the protests also involved unaccompanied minors at the closed facility, which currently houses some 250 asylum seekers. No injuries were reported.The asylum service’s operations have been scaled back due to the pandemic restriction measures that have affected many public services.Greek authorities are struggling to cope with a spike in migrant crossings from Turkey, at the land border and islands, that occurred before the lockdown.DENMARKA top medical official in Denmark said “it is very unlikely that another wave of corona will occur” in the Scandinavian country.“But we may see changes in the reproduction rate,” said Kaare Moelbak, of Statens Serum Institut, a government agency that maps the spread of coronavirus in Denmark. Currently the Danish so-called reproduction rate, which measures the average number of people a person with the virus infects, is at 0.7, down from a previous 0.9. It has been below 1.0 in the past weeks.Mr Moelbak said Denmark had now built up a test capacity and can now isolate infected people.He spoke at a news conference with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who announced that Denmark will create an agency to ensure the supply of protective equipment and testing facilities to “strengthen the preparedness” in the future.Denmark started a lockdown on March 11th and has in the past few weeks slowly reopened society.INDONESIAIndonesia’s death toll from the coronavirus outbreak has breached the 1,000-mark, making it the country with the most Covid-19 deaths and the highest fatality rate in South East Asia.Covid-19 task force spokesman Achmad Yurianto confirmed 16 new deaths in the last 24 hours, taking the country’s death toll to 1,007.The number of coronavirus fatalities has come under scrutiny in recent days as media reports and medical experts said the national death toll was likely to be more than double the official figure of 1,007.Indonesia has one of the lowest testing rates in the world and some epidemiologists say that has made it harder to get an accurate picture of the infections in the world’s fourth most populous country.INDIAIndia is reopening parts of its colossal rail network and will run limited trains as the country begins easing its nearly seven-week strict lockdown amid an increase in coronavirus infections.Special trains will depart from select big cities, including Delhi and Mumbai, and run to full capacity. Passengers will be allowed to enter stations only if they are asymptomatic and clear thermal screening they must maintain social distancing on board and will be given hand sanitisers upon entry and exit.The train network often described as India’s lifeline s 67,000 kilometres (42,000 miles) and carries more than 20 million passengers daily.India’s rail, road and air services were suspended in late March as part of a tight nationwide lockdown that has helped keep confirmed coronavirus infections relatively low for a population of 1.3 billion. But in recent days, as the lockdown has eased and some businesses have reopened, infections and deaths due to Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, are increasing.SINGAPORESingaporeans will be able to get a haircut at the barber shop or visit a bakery as the government loosens coronavirus restrictions three weeks before a partial lockdown ends.Despite an upsurge in cases due to an outbreak among foreign workers staying in crowded dormitories, the government says transmission in the local community has dropped and it plans a phased reopening of the economy.Barbers and hairdressers, food manufacturers and outlets, and laundry shops are among selected businesses that can open with strict health measures in place after five weeks of shutdown.Singapore has reported 23,822 infections, the most in Asia after China, India and Pakistan. But it has a low fatality rate of 21 deaths.PHILIPPINESPhilippine president Rodrigo Duterte has said the massive lockdown that has restricted millions to their homes will be eased, but warned that people who want to return to work must follow safeguards to avoid more deaths and a second wave of Covid-19 outbreaks.The Philippine economy contracted in the first quarter and the finance secretary reported that up to 1.5 million jobs have been lost during the lockdown on Luzon island, the country’s most populous region, which includes the capital, Manila.Mr Duterte made the announcement in videotaped remarks shown on nationwide television. He said his spokesman will later disclose which regions will remain under lockdown and which areas would be released based on the scale and speed of infections. The two-month lockdown was supposed to last until May 15th.The Philippines has reported more than 11,000 infections, including 726 deaths.CHINAChina has reported just one new coronavirus case as the government presses ahead with reopening measures, including allowing some students in Beijing to return to class and Shanghai Disneyland to open its gates again to a limited number of visitors.Other measures have included permitting Beijing’s ancient Forbidden City to expand its visitor numbers, as long as they book online first, show evidence they are healthy and wear a mask while touring the massive complex that was home to generations of China’s emperors.The National Health Commission also said 115 people remain in treatment and 763 are being isolated and monitored as either suspected cases or after testing positive for the virus without showing symptoms.China has not reported a new death from the virus in almost a month. In total, it has recorded 4,633 deaths among 82,919 cases since the virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan last year.NEW ZEALANDNew Zealand health authorities have reported no new coronavirus cases, the third day since early last week the country of 5 million people has recorded zero additional cases.The news came as New Zealand prepared to relax many of the restrictions imposed since the outbreak began. Most businesses, including retail stores, shopping centres, restaurants and gyms, can reopen on Thursday and schools will reopen on Monday. Bars will be able to start serving customers again on May 21st.Social distancing rules will still apply and social gatherings will be limited to 10 people.AUSTRALIAPrime minister Scott Morrison says Australia is winning the battle against the coronavirus but it “still has the great potential to do enormous harm to the livelihoods of Australians”.New South Wales, the most populous state, recorded no new cases of coronavirus for the first time since health authorities began documenting a daily total of infections in February.Australia has reported nearly 7,000 cases, with fewer than 770 active. The national death toll is 97, with New South Wales recording the highest number of fatalities at 46.The federal government has announced a three-phase easing of coronavirus restrictions in the coming months, with states and territories to determine the timing. The initial phase will include the reopening of cafes, restaurants and shops, plus allowing outdoor gatherings of up to 10 people.Social distancing and hygiene measures will stay in place. - APPAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus positive good news round up surprise first birthday","story":"A personal trainer in Fulham, Flo Dowler, has been leading her neighbours in workout classes, a month after she first started bringing the street together with exercise.

He told PA that the woman “said there were so many other people in her complex, with no family, in the same position as her, struggling to get what they needed”.After buying her some aspirin, he started a Facebook campaign to start helping other vulnerable people in the community.The father-of-five and his wife Natasha spent £1,700 of their own money to buy more than 50 bags of shopping for dozens of people. They put together food packages of beans, tomatoes, eggs, bread, fruit juice, snacks and toiletries.Mr Vine continues to work – at Thames Water, which is now matching the amount spent at the supermarket – and puts the packages together in his spare time.I feel like we\u0027re doing our bit to help, and if we can inspire others to do the same in their own towns and villages, then even better, he said.Three pleasant things to put into your head I laughed at these two mantises throwing shapes for a solid five minutes.Here is some important lockdown guidance.Guy Lachlan sent in this photo of his son Austin’s 21st birthday celebrations.

South Africa’s president won office because he was seen as moderate and business friendly, a level head and soothing hand after nearly a decade of shrill populism under his predecessor, Jacob Zuma.Fixing the rotten legacy he inherited would always be a daunting challenge. Since he took the oath of office in February, 2018, South Africa has twice slipped into recession as the years of waste, corruption and ineptitude took their toll.Even before the country’s first confirmed case was reported in KwaZulu Natal in early March, South Africa’s economy was shrinking, its people getting poorer.But now, five weeks into one of the world’s strictest lockdowns, Africa’s most developed state is facing the prospect of unparalleled financial upheaval.By one measure, the restrictions Mr Ramaphosa has imposed, from a ban on alcohol and cigarette sales to a prohibition on dog walking, have been impressively successful.South Africa might have the largest number of cases on the continent — 9,420 in total, with 186 deaths — but it started to flatten the curve of its infection rate in the last week of March.In fact, the overall death rate has actually fallen: in a notoriously violent country, the lockdown has meant that South Africans have had fewer opportunities to murder each other, while the prohibition on booze meant there has been less drink-driving.Yet if one catastrophe may have been averted, another is looming, and a growing number of voices are suggesting that the lockdown might not be worth it — that it could even cost more lives than it saves.“There is very little for us to gain and almost everything to lose by keeping people at home and keeping businesses shut any longer,” John Steenhuisen, the interim leader of South Africa’s Democratic Alliance opposition, said in a speech on Friday.Mr Ramaphosa has authorised a phased easing of the lockdown. Some employees in selected manufacturing industries are being allowed back to work under strict conditions.But most restrictions remain in place and many South Africans, anxious about their survival, are starting to chafe against them.South Africa may be the world’s most economically unequal state, but the lockdown has brought misery across the race and class ide and Mr Steenhuisen’s criticism is starting to resonate throughout society.For although the president has unveiled what is by far Africa’s biggest stimulus and social relief programme — worth 500bn rand (£22bn) and equivalent to 10 percent of Gross Domestic Product — its delivery has been patchy at best.The state has only been able to reach a fraction of those South Africans who need food aid. Most are being fed by private charities.Even the private charities face being overwhelmed. On April 29, donors from local businesses and mosques set up stalls to deliver 8,000 food parcels to residents of two townships near Johannesburg. Within an hour, a two-mile queue had formed.Florence Malope, a resident of Alexandra, one of the oldest of Johannesburg’s townships, is among those who has registered to receive food aid from the provincial government. So far none has been forthcoming.A cleaner, she is still just about to make ends meet because an employer she works for one day a week is still paying her, even though she cannot actually report for duty. Many of her neighbours, however, are far worse off.“I see people every day, including children, going to bed at night without eating,” she said. “Some are starving.”More than 700,000 people live in “Alex”, a 2.7 sq mile patch of squalor across the highway from Sandton City, the richest square mile in Africa. At least a third of the country’s population of 58m still live in similar townships and squatter camps.Many of them are desperate. Before the lockdown, school-going children could at least count on being given a decent meal a day. But with schools closed, many families now have less to eat and more mouths to feed.And the problem is only likely to grow. Economic modelling conducted by the World Bank and others calculates that more Africans are likely to enter poverty than escape it for the first time in decades.South Africa will not be an exemption. The country’s treasury estimates that as many as 7m will lose their jobs.The country’s economic picture could not be grimmer. Last month, the rand fell to a record low against the dollar and South Africa’s credit rating was downgraded to junk status.Some of the country\u0027s most famous companies seem unlikely to survive. South African Airways, the continent’s oldest airline, has entered bankruptcy protection and is seeking to lay off all its staff. It is almost certainly doomed.More than half of the country’s magazine titles, some of which have been in publication for more than 50 years, have gone under in the past fortnight.With no visitors entering South Africa, the tourism sector, from hotels in the Cape to safari lodges in the Kruger National Park, has been ravaged.Even South African Breweries, one of the country’s most successful firms, is in crisis. Last week it announced it would have to dump 34 million gallons of beer, literally throwing it down the drain, because of the ban on alcohol sales.Ultimately, analysts say, the economic devastation will cost not just livelihoods but also lives — with some predicting the economy could shrink by as much as 17 percent, a decline of similar severity to that witnessed in the United States during the Great Depression.“The recession is going to be much deeper than we thought and is going to endure much longer,” said Martin Kingston, head of the economic workgroup at Business for South Africa, which represents some of the country’s biggest companies.“A continued lockdown is not only damaging the economy. It promises a humanitarian disaster to dwarf Covid-19.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 12th may 2020","story":"Coronavirus latest news: Summer holidays \u0026#39very likely\u0026#39 to be cancelled, Matt Hancock admitsThree arrested in Portsmouth baby murder investigationComment: Coronavirus has made Brits act more stereotypically German than the GermansMore than 10,000 kilos of class A drugs seized since last month as lockdown makes smuggling harderPolitics latest news: Rishi Sunak extends furlough scheme to October, pledging \u0026#39flexibility\u0026#39 for firmsWHO: Herd immunity for the coronavirus is a \u0026#39dangerous concept\u0026#39 Can I see my family or friends under the new social distancing rules?Government\u0026#39s 50-page roadmap out of lockdown: what the new rules mean for youComment: I\u0026#39m not surprised people are deleting the NHS Responder app, if my experiences of it are anything to go byWatch: Prisoners deliberately try to catch coronavirus in California jailComment: Artists should be let out to fill our streets with beauty and artPolice launch investigation as rail ticket officer dies from coronavirus after being spat atCare home deaths account for 40 per cent of UK coronavirus fatalitiesComment: \u0026#39Stay alert\u0026#39 hints at the PM\u0026#39s plan for people to take back control from coronavirusComment: Nicola Sturgeon\u0026#39s confused coronavirus messaging is putting lives at riskCoronavirus positive: Good news round-up – A surprise first birthday celebration Watch: Witness of Ahmaud Arbery killing says he\u0026#39s receiving death threatsWatch: How to make a no-sew, government-approved cloth face mask Spain to quarantine all international visitors for two weeks to counter threat of new Covid-19 casesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"watch make no sew government approved cloth face mask","story":"Cloth face coverings can help stop the spread of coronavirus and the government recommends wearing them in particular when it is difficult to maintain social distancing. Transport for London said face masks should be worn on all their public transport services. You can make your own cloth face mask out of an old t-shirt by watching the video above and following these steps:It\u0027s still important to practice good hygiene and wash your hands regularly, particularly before putting on and after taking off your mask. You should also wash your cloth face masks regularly - they can go in the wash with your other laundry, using your normal detergent. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wuhan test entire population 11m uptick cases prompts alarm","story":"The Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the global coronavirus outbreak, plans to conduct city-wide nucleic acid testing over a 10-days period, according to an internal document seen by Reuters and two sources familiar with the situation.Every district in the city has been told to submit a detailed testing plan for their respective area by Tuesday, the document showed.The plans come with global alarm over a potential second wave of coronavirus infections growing on Monday after Germany reported that the reproduction \u0027R\u0027 rate of the virus had risen above one.Wuhan reported its first cluster of coronavirus infections since lockdown was lifted a month ago, stoking concern about a wider coronavirus resurgence.The five new confirmed cases, all from the same residential compound, come amid efforts to ease restrictions across China as businesses restart and iniduals return to work.We must resolutely contain the risk of a rebound, the health authority in Wuhan, a city with a population of about 11 million, said in a statement on Monday.All the latest cases in Wuhan were previously classified as asymptomatic – people who test positive for the virus and are capable of infecting others but do not show clinical signs.Hundreds of asymptomatic cases in Wuhan, which was released from its months-long lockdown on April 8, are being monitored.On average, Wuhan has conducted about 47,000 nucleic acid tests each day since the lockdown was lifted, Reuters calculations based on reports by the city\u0027s health authority show.China does not include asymptomatic cases in its overall tally of confirmed cases, now at 82,918, until they exhibit signs of infection.

We can’t wait to hear what these artists create next.”Apple announces next major event with iPhone and Mac updatesThe latest update comes free to anyone who has already bought Logic. It costs £199.99 from the Mac App Store, though the company recently started offering a 90-day free trial.Included in the updated features is a new “Quick Sampler” that allows users to grab any inidual sound and turn it into a playable instrument. The sound of somebody speaking could be grabbed from the Voice Memos app, for instance, and then played as a music instrument with a keyboard.Live Loops allows users to similarly take samples, loops or recordings and arrange them into a grid so they can be mixed around and have effects applied.Both features are more reminiscent of Garageband, Apple’s free music creation software tool that is available across its platforms. Apple has worked to bring the two apps together in recent years, allowing people to start making songs on their iPhone and move them into the premium, professional editing suite, for instance.Apple has also added new beat creation features including a new step sequencer to allow people to more quickly and easily throw sounds together to turn them into a into a beat. Other features such as the Drum Machine Designer – which allows people to make their own drum sounds – will integrate with that new feature.Logic Remote, Apple’s separate app for iPhone or iPad which allows users to control the workstation on their computer, will also receive an update to support the new features.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The 2016 halving triggered a 300 per cent\u0026nbspjump in the value of bitcoin,” Nigel Green, CEO of financial consultancy firm deVere, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.“There is no reason to believe this time the market will not respond with a longer-term upward trajectory. Indeed, the rally which is likely on its way could potentially be even more dramatic because there is more mass awareness than ever before of the long-term use of and need for digital currencies.”Other analysts remain cautious about how much of an impact the halving event will actually have on the cryptocurrency market.The introduction of futures markets in bitcoin in late 2017 means that such significant price surges are less likely to happen, according to Ganesh Viswanath-Natraj, assistant professor of finance at Warwick Business School.“Some estimates have the price of bitcoin doubling, or increasing by even more with estimates of up to $50,000. However there are good reasons to believe this is a vast overstatement of the true fundamentals of the bitcoin price,” he said.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

But that has to be compared to the counterfactual – the cost of those millions of workers going onto the dole and universal credit. It has to be set, too, against what would have been the damage to the productive capacity of our economy of all those decent companies going under, of all those company-specific skills of laid off workers being wasted.So: a good thing. But, at some point, most analysts accept that the furlough scheme risks being counterproductive.As the lockdown eases more business will be able to, at least partially, re-open. But the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme doesn’t allow furloughed employees to work part-time, thus creating a financial incentive for managers to keep workers on the programme rather than bringing them back into action. That’s not in the interests of workers, their employers, or the wider economy.It’s also likely that, at some point, the scheme will be keeping alive some firms that simply have no viable post-crisis future. That too is damaging for inidual workers locked into these “zombie” companies and, again, for the wider economy.Yet, all this said, withdrawing the support too early could be lethal for some long-term viable businesses – think of pubs and restaurants – which are likely to see reduced custom due to\u0026nbspsocial distancing well into the future even as other parts of the economy are able to open up.Balancing all that is the almost nightmarish challenge for policymakers.So how does Rishi Sunak’s latest announced reforms to the furlough scheme measure up to the challenge?The one-month extension of the current scheme to the end of July buys a little more time for companies that need to make decisions on starting redundancy processes – or not – now.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe extension of a reformed scheme, after that, to the end of October is towards the higher end of expectations – the Chancellor will likely have resisted a considerable amount of Treasury pressure to bring it to an end sooner than that given that the total cost of eight months of support is likely to pass £60bn.Allowing furloughed workers to return part-time from August should be helpful in orienting the incentives in the scheme to opening up. Employers will be asked to share more of the burden of furloughed workers’ wages, which, again, seems a reasonable tweak to incentives.And the 80 per cent floor for furloughed or partially-furloughed workers’ wages – regardless of whether government or employers foot the bill – shows a commendable political priority of maintaining the living standards of employees.In all, it seems a reasonable stab by the Chancellor at striking a balance between protection and reforming incentives – as attested by the broad support of unions and employers’ groups for the reforms.But, of course, we await the important details – due at the end of this month – of how the relative contributions of employer and state will change, and whether it may vary by sector.And won’t know for sure whether it’s the right balance until the reforms kick in and we see the response on the ground.The Chancellor, sensibly, didn’t rule out extending the scheme beyond October if necessary.

The fall was the steepest on record and worse than any of\u0026nbsp the 18 forecasts collected by Reuters.The eurozone’s third-largest economy has been among the hardest hit by the virus with more than 30,000 deaths. Provisional figures suggest Italy’s GDP contracted 4.7 per cent in the first quarter of the year.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesItaly was one of the first to be hit by Covid-19, with soaring death rates leading to a nationwide lockdown imposed from 10 March and all non-essential production being shut down since 22 March.Industrial production is likely to have fallen even further in April, with economists forecasting a 50 per cent decline on the same month last year.Industrial production plunged across the board in March, Istat said, with output of consumer goods, investment goods, intermediate goods and energy products all down.“The Italian industry recorded a historically weak March,” Oxford Economics said in a note. The decline hit all sectors, “but the 50 percent drop in transport equipment was just astonishing”, it said.The government forecasts GDP will contract by 8 per cent this year, with other economists predicting a steeper decline of closer to 13 per cent.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastPrime minister Giuseppe Conte said on Monday he may announce a further easing of\u0026nbspItaly’s lockdown earlier than planned.Mr Conte told newspaper Corriere della Sera that ahead he sees “a sharp fall in GDP and the economic consequences will be very painful”.Italy partially eased its strict lockdown conditions last week, allowing manufacturing and construction companies to start back up.Shops are due to re-open on 18 May, with bars, restaurants and barbers to start operating on 1 June.“We’re gathering the data from the latest monitoring and with the experts we’re defining clear safety rules for workers and customers,” Mr Conte said. “If the situation remains under control on the epidemiological level, we’ll be able to agree some earlier moves with the regions.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Health secretary Matt Hancock denied it was ever part of government strategy.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDr Ryan told a press briefing in Geneva: “Humans are not herds, and, as such, the concept of herd immunity is generally reserved for calculating how many people will need to be vaccinated and the population in order to generate that effect.”The WHO director added: “So I do think this idea that ‘maybe countries who had lax measures and haven’t done anything will all of a sudden magically reach some herd immunity, and so what if we lose a few old people along the way?’ This is a really dangerous, dangerous calculation.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreakThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusQuarantine: What do new UK travel guidelines mean for my holidays?Herd immunity\u0026nbspis an epidemiological concept\u0026nbspusually reserved for describing how a population\u0026nbspis protected from a disease depending on the levels of people vaccinated.For instance, when between 90 per cent and 95 per cent of the population is vaccinated against measles, this should be enough to protect others who are unable to get an inoculation – such as babies before they reach the age at which they can be immunised.Sir David King, the former chief scientific adviser to the UK government suggested at the end of April that ministers could still secretly be seeking to create herd immunity, having “softened” their tests for starting to relax restrictions.“Maybe we are going for herd immunity? In other words, maybe the policy is to allow the virus to spread so that we have a large proportion of our population who have antibodies and, at that point, we will all be resistant to the virus and the lockdown can be removed?”Dr Ryan said he was hopeful that Germany and South Korea would be able to suppress new clusters of the virus and praised their test and tracing surveillance programmes, which he said was key to avoiding large second waves.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We don’t know exactly what that level needs to be for Covid-19. But it certainly needs to be higher than what we’re seeing in seroprevalence studies.”Seroprevalence refers to the level of a pathogen in a population, as measured in blood serum.Dr Van\u0026nbspKerkhove\u0026nbspadded: “What the sero-epidemiologic studies indicate to us is that there’s a large portion of the population that remains susceptible.”Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The fall was the steepest on record and worse than any of\u0026nbsp the 18 forecasts collected by Reuters.The eurozone’s third-largest economy has been among the hardest hit by the virus with more than 30,000 deaths. Provisional figures suggest Italy’s GDP contracted 4.7 per cent in the first quarter of the year.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesItaly was one of the first to be hit by Covid-19, with soaring death rates leading to a nationwide lockdown imposed from 10 March and all non-essential production being shut down since 22 March.Industrial production is likely to have fallen even further in April, with economists forecasting a 50 per cent decline on the same month last year.Industrial production plunged across the board in March, Istat said, with output of consumer goods, investment goods, intermediate goods and energy products all down.“The Italian industry recorded a historically weak March,” Oxford Economics said in a note. The decline hit all sectors, “but the 50 percent drop in transport equipment was just astonishing”, it said.The government forecasts GDP will contract by 8 per cent this year, with other economists predicting a steeper decline of closer to 13 per cent.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastPrime minister Giuseppe Conte said on Monday he may announce a further easing of\u0026nbspItaly’s lockdown earlier than planned.Mr Conte told newspaper Corriere della Sera that ahead he sees “a sharp fall in GDP and the economic consequences will be very painful”.Italy partially eased its strict lockdown conditions last week, allowing manufacturing and construction companies to start back up.Shops are due to re-open on 18 May, with bars, restaurants and barbers to start operating on 1 June.“We’re gathering the data from the latest monitoring and with the experts we’re defining clear safety rules for workers and customers,” Mr Conte said. “If the situation remains under control on the epidemiological level, we’ll be able to agree some earlier moves with the regions.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Anyone else in the house can then scan that code and join the same session.As well as being able to add tracks, anyone in the session can use Spotify\u0027s playback controls to skip forward or back, or play and pause.All of the people using the feature must have a paid, premium Spotify account. Though it can support as many as 100 people, they must all be in the same physical space.The tool is rolling out now and in beta form, meaning not all users may have access to it.

He warned that the presence of vast satellite constellations could interrupt radio frequencies and disrupt images from optical telescopes, which may obscure sightings of Earth-bound asteroids.SpaceX\u0026nbspsaid it is working with space agencies to minimise any potential impact of the Starlink satellites, while also taking a number of its own measures to reduce their visibility.Following April\u0027s launch, CEO Elon Musk said he is working on a solution\u0026nbspto hide the satellites from ground-based observers.We\u0027re fixing it now, he tweeted. We are taking some key steps to reduce satellite brightness.. Should be much less noticeable during orbit raise by changing solar panel angle and all satellites get sunshades starting with launch nine.Created with Sketch.Jeff Bezos\u0027 plan for future space colonies Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceJeff Bezos introducing a life-size model of the Blue Moon, a lunar lander that could move many tons of cargo between earth and the moonAn artist rendering of Blue Moon on the surface of the moonBezos also announced that his company Blue Origin will meet the current Administration\u0027s goal of putting Americans on the Moon by 2024 with the Blue Moon lunar landerThe Blue Moon would be powered by the BE-7 engineBezos also announced that his company Blue Origin will meet the current Administration\u0027s goal of putting Americans on the Moon by 2024 with the Blue Moon lunar landerBezos also announced that his company Blue Origin will meet the current Administration\u0027s goal of putting Americans on the Moon by 2024 with the Blue Moon lunar landerAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceJeff Bezos introducing a life-size model of the Blue Moon, a lunar lander that could move many tons of cargo between earth and the moonAn artist rendering of Blue Moon on the surface of the moonBezos also announced that his company Blue Origin will meet the current Administration\u0027s goal of putting Americans on the Moon by 2024 with the Blue Moon lunar landerThe Blue Moon would be powered by the BE-7 engineBezos also announced that his company Blue Origin will meet the current Administration\u0027s goal of putting Americans on the Moon by 2024 with the Blue Moon lunar landerBezos also announced that his company Blue Origin will meet the current Administration\u0027s goal of putting Americans on the Moon by 2024 with the Blue Moon lunar landerWhen questioned about\u0026nbspthe Starlink satellites\u0027 potential interference at a recent conference, he said that concerns were being exaggerated.I am confident that we will not cause any impact whatsoever in astronomical discoveries, zero.

–\u0026nbspand as health workers across the globe continue to battle against the coronavirus pandemic – the legacy of the trailblazing nurse has never been so pertinent.Tuesday marks both International Nurses’ Day and 200 years since Nightingale’s birth in Florence, Italy, on 12 May 1820.The Independent\u0026nbsphas put together a video tribute to nurses around the world to mark Nightingale’s 200th birthday and International Nurses Day, highlighting the crucial role health workers have played throughout the coronavirus pandemic.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn the video, nurses wearing\u0026nbspPPE\u0026nbsparound the world have each recited a line from the 1857 Henry Longfellow poem Santa\u0026nbspFilomena\u0026nbsp– which refers to a “lady with a lamp” in reference to Florence Nightingale and her work during the Crimean War.The importance of her key nursing values –\u0026nbspmaintaining good hygiene, regularly washing hands, and carrying out evidence-based practices – have been echoed over recent months.Nightingale developed these crucial habits during the Crimean War (1853-56), when, along with a small troupe of nurses, she tended soldiers’ wounds and worked to improve hospital conditions.Created with Sketch.Silence for key workers who lost lives to coronavirus Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with

at St Thomas’ Hospital in London, developing palliative care and midwifery, and shaping the redesign of hospitals across the UK and the health system itself.Health leaders continue to use the concept of evidence-based healthcare – a theory Nightingale pioneered and advocated for and which is currently being used by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to track and trace Covid-19 patients.Her passion for data saw her become the first female member of the Royal Statistical Society, while her invention of the coxcombe, an early version of a pie chart, used to show Queen Victoria and her government the connection between cleanliness and the mortality rate of British soldiers, is being used today to combat the current pandemic.Elsewhere, her compassion towards nurses has also had an impact on modern practices and historians have drawn parallels to the current PPE (personal protective equipment) crisis.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out

I was having a Zoom drink with a friend and it got to a stage where I was so exhausted. I thought maybe I was just a bit hungover or was in a weird mood but then it continued and I felt exhausted the next night on another Zoom call.”How to support our campaignHer condition deteriorated rapidly. “I was having to consciously remember to breathe,” she added. “My lungs hurt. It was really scary. I was an alien for a while, I could barely speak. I wasn’t sure if I would make it.”Ms Khan rang 111, who told her to wait it out at home and see if she got worse. But within days, she said she couldn’t even walk. “I felt weak and dizzy. I couldn’t move at all, I was just on the sofa, trying to remember to breathe. I thought I might be having a heart attack or a stroke. My left side felt numb.”A friend called 999 on her behalf and medics came to her home. Ms Khan continued: “They checked my vitals and they were happy enough with me. My oxygen levels were okay and they said it might be that I was fatigued.“They said sometimes people get another blow when they are almost over the virus and that is what probably happened to me. It felt like an exorcism.” At the peak of her illness, Ms Khan went online to seek help. The artist, whose mother is in her seventies and is isolating so could not support her, found out about Help the Hungry via Facebook, where she was connected with Made in Hackney.For the past three weeks, she has been receiving daily meals via the organisation, saying the service has made her life “so much easier”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She said: “It is so beautiful. It is unity in art and we need that at this time.”Cyclist Andy Chan,\u0026nbspfrom Lewisham, thanked The Independent for organising the projection. “Everyone needs to know there is a community and that everyone is standing together,” he said. “We will only get through this by standing together, as the message says.”The display was supported by the mayor of London and approved by the National Gallery.How to support our campaignJustine Simons, London’s deputy mayor for culture, said: “We are so pleased to support the projection. It captures the defining message of this time – that Londoners stand together. It is a powerful expression of thanks to all the Londoners who have helped distribute food as part of the Help The Hungry appeal.”The director of the National Gallery Gabriele Finaldi said the image was particularly appropriate because Sir Peter was a former associate artist at the institution.While it is closed, the gallery has been distributing images of its artwork via social media and providing free online talks by its experts.“We were delighted to help support The Independent’s\u0026nbspHelp The Hungry appeal,” Mr Finaldi said. “Thousands of Londoners have been helping to distribute the food and so we were honoured to get involved and help recognise their contribution.”Help The Hungry: Where our readers have led, the government followsWembley Stadium taken over by food charityThe projection was displayed after British YouTube star KSI had joined The Independent\u0026nbspat the Refettorio Felix at St Cuthbert’s Centre in Earl’s Court to help distribute food.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They don’t.“The health secretary doesn’t want to tell GMB viewers this information – I think it’s a disgrace.”Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Hancock refused to directly answer whether people have a legal right not to go to work if they do not feel safe due to Covid-19.In response, he said: “Well this needs to be a collaborative effort. Absolutely workplaces need to follow the guidelines on making a workplace safe for Covid, so that is very important.“Critically, everybody who can work from home should continue to work from home.”Asked for a second time whether people are protected by law if they felt unsafe in the workplace, the health secretary\u0026nbspsaid: “Well, employment law has not changed, but that isn’t the point.“The point is that businesses and employees should be working together to make the best of a very difficult situation.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But social distancing of some kind is going to continue,” Mr Hancock said.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreakThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusQuarantine: What do new UK travel guidelines mean for my holidays?Until now, some ministers have only said that they, personally, are not making any holiday plans, without setting out what the impact on the public is likely to be.Under the cautious lockdown easing, hospitality must wait for the third phase – no earlier than 4 July – to learn if it can return to some kind of normality.But Boris Johnson made clear it would only happen if coronavirus cases continued to be driven down and there was no evidence of a the much-feared second peak.Meanwhile, the UK – and Spain, amongst other countries – are planning strict quarantine rules for international arrivals, which will cripple the tourism industry it is feared.Airlines and tour operators were hoping that “Project Lift-off” would get under way in late June, in time for the two main holiday months of July and August.But the UK government’s proposed quarantine measures are likely to deter millions of British holidaymakers, as they will require 14 days of self-isolation for most people returning to the UK.In addition, a tangle of other restrictions apply abroad – with Spain abruptly announcing a temporary two-week quarantine rule for arriving visitors from Friday.The comments come after Mr Hancock drew criticism for arguing efforts to defeat Covid-19 in care homes had been a success, compared with other countries.He also dismissed claims that the public was bamboozled by a shambolic announcement of the lockdown changes from Sunday evening.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It includes tests that were posted out.\u0026nbspWe’re told 31,587 people have died. No they haven’t. It’s far more than that.”The professor, also chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at the University of Cambridge, continued: “I think this is not a trustworthy communication of statistics. It’s such a missed opportunity. There’s a public out there who are broadly very supportive of the measures, they’re hungry for details, for facts, for genuine information.How to be productive if you have to work from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsShould you be taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat coronavirus?What are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?“And yet they get fed this, what I call number theatre, which seems to be coordinated really much more by No 10’s communications team, rather than genuinely trying to inform people about what’s going on.”He added: “I just wish the data was being brought together and presented by people who really knew its strength and limitations and could treat the audience with some respect.”When asked by Marr later on the programme whether, in response to the criticism, the government would rethink the way they present the numbers, communities secretary Robert Jenrick said: “Well, I’m sure there’s ways we can improve these press conferences.“They continue to get large audiences, but they’re designed to inform the public. If there are better ways of presenting the numbers – and I very strongly respect the professor – if we can do that, we should and will do that.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is thought he is going\u0026nbspto drop the government’s “stay at home” messaging in favour of “stay alert” – sparking further accusations of mixed messaging and immediate rejections from Scotland and Wales.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

be made more flexible to allow part-time return to work over summerThe furlough scheme to support workers through the coronavirus crisis is being extended to the end of October, but employers will be asked to bear a share of the cost of\u0026nbsppaying staff up to 80 per cent of wages while they\u0026nbspare not working, chancellor Rishi Sunak has told the House of Commons.Mr Sunak said that additional flexibility will be built into the scheme to allow a part-time return to work over the summer, but the Treasury is not planning to reveal\u0026nbspprecise details of how this will work and how much employers will have to pay until the end of May.It raises the prospect that businesses like pubs and nightclubs could be told to contribute towards staff\u0026nbspsalaries despite being barred by the government from opening for business.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Sunak\u0026nbspsaid that the job retention scheme, which supports workers who would otherwise be laid off because of the collapse in economic activity resulting from the lockdown, had been a world-leading economic intervention, supporting 7.5 million jobs in almost 1 million businesses at a total cost of £10 billion so far.The scheme had been due to be wound down after four months in operation\u0026nbspat the end of June, and today\u0027s announcement means\u0026nbspemployers will not be forced to send out mass redundancy notices this week for that date.Created with Sketch.Silence for key workers who lost lives to coronavirus Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created

continue unchanged to the end of July, adding: Then from August to October, the scheme will continue for all sectors and regions of the UK, with greater flexibility to support the transition back to work.Employers currently using the scheme will be able to bring furloughed employees back part-time. And we will ask employers to start sharing with the government the cost of paying people\u0027s salaries.Full details will follow by the end of May, but I want to assure people today of one thing that won\u0027t change - workers will, through the combined efforts of governmnt and employers continue to receive the same level of overall support as they do now, at 80 per cent of their current salary up to £2,500 a month.Mr Sunak\u0027s announcement was welcomed as a huge relief for businesses across the UK by the British Chambers of Commerce, while the Institute of Directors said a\u0026nbsppart-time furlough will provide a much-needed launch ramp so businesses can start to get back up to speed.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Many firms that would normally be on strong footing are still in dire straits.“The extension puts yet more onus on helping those who have been left out in the cold. Countless small company directors have found scant support, and government shouldn’t turn a blind eye to them.”Employers needed assurances on the future of the scheme by the end of this week, in order to avoid having to issue mass redundancy notices for the end of June.TUC\u0026nbspgeneral secretary Frances O’Grady said the move would be a big relief for millions and maintaining the furlough rate at 80 per cent was a win for the pay packets of working families.She added: “As the economic consequences of Covid-19 become clear, unions will keep pushing for a job guarantee scheme to make sure everyone has a decent job.”British Chambers of Commerce\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Further investigation has since found more than 100 infections that appear linked to the nightspots.A Christian church-founded newspaper, Kookmin Ilbo, reported last week that the places the man visited in Itaewon on 2 May\u0026nbspincluded a gay club. The report was followed by a flood of anti-gay slurs on social media that included blaming the man and those at the club for endangering the country’s fight against the pandemic.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesViews on sexual minorities in South Korea have gradually improved in recent years, but anti-gay sentiments still run deep in the conservative country. Same-sex marriages aren’t legal and there are no prominent openly gay politicians or business executives, though some have risen to stardom in the entertainment world.Activist groups have criticised the Kookmin Ilbo report, saying that it was irrelevant that some of the nightspots the man went to were popular with gay people and the newspaper should not have disclosed it.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreakThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusQuarantine: What do new UK travel guidelines mean for my holidays?It’s not even known how big role the man played in the new outbreak, with officials saying that local infections in Itaewon may have already begun before he contracted the illness. Authorities have been trying to track down and test thousands of people who may have come in contact with those infected, a process activist say has been made more difficult now that there is a sexual stigma attached to the new outbreak.Lee Jong-geol, general director of the gay rights advocacy group Chingusai, said dozens of sexual minorities who had recently visited Itaewon clubs called his office and expressed worry about being outed or disadvantaged at work if they are placed under quarantine.While there have been no reports hate crimes or physical attacks linked to the fresh surge of homophobia, Mr Jong-geol said “anxiety and fear have flared inside of sexual minority communities”.The new cluster threatens South Korea’s hard-won gains in its virus fight, which were the result of aggressive contact tracing and mass testing. The roughly 30 new cases reported daily the past three days are higher than single-digit increases the country had been reporting recently.

Heath Ministry official Yoon Taeho said on Tuesday that police were trying to track down club and bar patrons who officials haven’t been able to contact.Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun and several health officials expressed worry that the surge in homophobic sentiment could hurt the virus fight.“At least under the viewpoint of quarantine, denunciation of a certain community isn’t helpful,” Chung said in televised remarks on Sunday. “If contacts avoid diagnostic tests in fear of criticism, our society has to shoulder its entire consequences.”Kim Jyu-hye, who doesn’t identify as strictly male or female and lives in a rural town, said that people there, when talking about what happened in the Itaewon clubs, often said that “gays like roaming around all night long and sleeping with many men”.“These days, I feel more isolated and I’m afraid about my relationships with other people because they are shifting their anger about new coronavirus outbreaks onto sexual minorities,” Jyu-hye\u0026nbspsaid.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The price of the raw materials that many export have plummeted too.

In Bavaria, zoos, museums and libraries have been given the green light to reopen with strict social distancing in place.This follows the earlier reopening of shops, playgrounds, museums, and churches across the country, along with secondary schools only.However, with responsibility for education devolved to Germany’s 16 federal states, some have been moving quicker than others. In Bavaria, one of the country’s worst-hit regions, school openings had been delayed until Monday.To reduce the risk of transmission, class sizes have been cut in half, one-way systems enforced in corridors, and lunch breaks staggered.Masks and gloves have even been handed out among staff and students at some schools, such as the ISR International School on the Rhine, near Dusseldorf.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailEileen Lyons, the school\u0027s director, told The Independent that students have also had the opportunity to “choose between virtual classes or physical classes at ISR since 9 March, depending on the level of risk of the students and families”.“This has allowed us to provide continuous lessons from kindergarten through to grade 12,” she added.The green light has also been given for the return of the Bundesliga, Germany’s top football league, which is due to restart next weekend – despite the recent positive tests recorded among Dynamo Dresden’s squad.Germany\u0027s chancellor, Angela Merkel, emphasised that people needed to continue to maintain social distancing despite the changes.It\u0027s very important to me to again draw attention to the fact that we\u0027re entering a new phase of the pandemic and that it will now be necessary, with all the easing of measures, to be sure that people stick to the basic rules ie keeping their distance, wearing mouth and nose protection and showing consideration for each other, Ms Merkel told reporters.The easing of restrictions has been accompanied by nationwide calls for the accelerated lifting of containment measures.On Saturday, thousands of protesters gathered in a number of major German cities, including Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart and Berlin, where about 30 people were arrested outside the Reichstag for not obeying social distancing measures.Despite the growing pressure to reopen\u0026nbspsociety, with many of the federal states eager to return to some degree of normality, questions continue to persist over the country’s current course of action, which appears to have sparked a recent\u0026nbspspike in cases.More than 1,250 new confirmed cases were reported on Saturday, many of which were linked to outbreaks in slaughterhouses and nursing homes. Before the lockdown was eased, the number of daily cases had fallen below the 1,000 mark.Many of the 205 people infected in a meat plant in Coesfeld, a city in NRW, were migrant workers from eastern Europe living in shared accommodation. NRW\u0027s health minister, Karl-Josef Laumann, said that an estimated 17,000-20,000 employees in all of the state’s 35 slaughterhouses would be tested for the coronavirus, including\u0026nbspall 1,200 workers at the Coesfeld plant.While many have called for greater action in relaxing restrictions, others have criticised the government for moving too quickly.Karl Lauterbach, a Social Democrat lawmaker and professor of epidemiology, has warned that Covid-19 could start spreading again quickly after seeing large crowds out and about on Saturday in his home city of Cologne.“It has to be expected that the R rate will go over 1 and we will return to exponential growth,” Prof Lauterbach said in a tweet. “The loosening measures were far too poorly prepared.”To help contain any future coronavirus clusters, Ms Merkel last week unveiled an “emergency brake” which will require local authorities to reimpose restrictions if the numbers of cases rise above a threshold of 50 per 100,000 people.In recent days, five areas have broken the threshold, including the southern town of Rosenheim, where a number of cases were found in a refugee shelter. It was not immediately clear whether officials would reimpose restrictions across the town or limit measures to the affected asylum centre.Although much has been made of Germany’s rising R rate, the RKI has also warned against jumping to conclusions.The institute said that because of the fluctuations in statistics it could not yet be assessed “whether the trend of new infections, which has been falling in recent weeks, has continued or whether the number of cases has increased again”.The RKI also warned last month\u0026nbspthat the dynamics of the\u0026nbsppandemic should not be judged on the R rate alone. It is an “important factor” but “only one measure among many”, said RKI\u0027s president, Lothar Wieler.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

and you can even tape down some wire to stfen the mask,you have any.Finish by punching holes in each end and threading elastic through to fit around your ears.If you dont have elastic bands you could also use a hair tie.Another method involves using a T-shirt without the need for any sewing or stitching.A YouTube tutorial by Runa Ray explains that for the T-shirt method, you need to cut out a in by in rectangle from the material.Then fold it in half and measure in on either side before making an equal number of cuts along the edges with scissors.Then turn the fabric inside out and knot each of the tails, but leave the four outer edges.Cut two more strips of material and tie them to the ends - these are the straps that will go around your ears.Some people have also used a vacuum cleaner bag to create a face mask, which is a bit more complicated - and only worksyou have a spare, clean bag to hand.Here we take a look at some of the dferent types of face mask and how well they work...N respiratorsN masks are disposable face masks that are proven to filter the air to an industrial standard.Manufacturers y, but the N is a stamp from the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to show that it is efficient.The N stands for Not resistant to oil because the mask only protects against particles, not fluids, while the  means it filters out  per cent of airborne particles.They generally have an eight-hour shelf le before becoming clogged depending on the work youre doing.As they offer so much protection, they are used by doctors and nurses in a medical setting.However, they have not been recommended for use to the general public yet due to supply issues for health workers.Surgical masksThese disposable three-ply masks are fluid-resistant and theyre the most common type of facial protection youll see health care staff wearing.They are used to prevent infected droplets from doctors, nurses and carers entering the respiratory system of the patient.Although they dont have built-in air filters, they are considered effective enough for most staff outside of intensive care.The nose clip can be bent to fit snugly around the nose, however they are a loose fit and the material gapes at the sides so they dont protect against all particles.When they become wet, theyre effectiveness is also reduced.Also, they are disposable and are only intended to be worn once.DIY dust masks Found in most hardware stores, dust masks can offer some level of protection from particles -worn correctly.If it says FFP then it’s a basic kind of dust mask and offers the lowest level of filtration for this kind of respirators mask.To meet European standards, they have to be able to filter at least  per cent of particles - with FFP filtering  per cent.That means that it can’t filter out tiny particles associated with viruses and bacteria.You can also get a FFP mask, which looks similar but has a small filter in the middle to catch almost all airborne particles.Short of being a full gas mask it offers the best protection - as long as it fits properly - and is more effective than N as well as the FFP and FFP.Cycling masksThese are generally worn by cyclists to prevent them from breathing in pollution in heavy traffic.Usually made from neoprene, they fit tightly to the face and are intended to offer a level of protection from airborne particles.Some are also marketed as N, or N grade, which means the amount of filtered airbone particles is either  or  per cent.Homemade masksAs many people cant get their hands on a mask, some have turned to fashioning their own.Theres been tips on using vacuum cleaner bags and even sanitary towels to cover your face.While most wont be as effective as anything you can buy in a store, they will offer more protection than not covering your face at all.Research by Public Health England in  looked at the suitability of household materials that could be used as masks to filter bacterial and viral aerosols and found vacuum bags actually worked well.Experts say that you should aim for multiple layers - a double layer of tightly-woven cotton with a thread count of at least  was one of the best barriers, according to researchers in the US.Even a bandana, scarf or T-shirt can be used to cover your nose and mouth while in public. Experts have previously said in order for the use of face coverings to be effective, nine in  people need to wear them.The Government document states face coverings should not be used by children under the age of two, people with respiratory conditions as well as those who could find it hard to wear them correctly such as primary school age children.Experts are still pretty ided on their effectiveness outside of a medical setting.Wearing a mask can act as a physical barrier to prevent infecting othersyou are sick by blocking the droplets that come out when you cough or sneeze.But some experts argue that people can accidentally infect themselves when taking a mask off or they can lead to complacency with other measures such as hand-washing.New evidence from Hong Kong about face masks has been shared confidentially with the World Health Organisation.The data hasnt been made public yet but it reportedly suggests that the protective gear was effective in slowing the spread in Asian countries.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.”SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.Professor Susan Michie, of University College London, said there is not good evidence to suggest wearing masks will cut transmissions.She said: They do not protect against the virus getting into the eyes - only close fitting goggles do this.People may not fit the masks properly or take them on and off. Touching face masks and not taking them off in the correct way may mean people contaminate their hands and spread the virus.People may have a  sense of reassurance and thus pay less attention to other behaviours key to reducing transmission such as social distancing and hand-washing.Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, reviewed  studies which looked at the efficacy of face masks in preventing respiratory illness.He said the research was poor, adding that it was as easy to make an argument for opposing the widespread use of masks as it would be to make an argument promoting their use.Most experts are in agreement that for masks to work as they are intended, they must be used correctly.Dr Jenna Macciochi, a lecturer in immunology at the University of Sussex, told the Mail: To be effective, a mask has to be fitted correctly, worn correctly and disposed of correctly — which is not something the general public has been trained in.She added that not wearing one correctly is potentially more hazardous than not using one at all, as you may infect yourself with the particles the mask is protecting you against when you take it off.The WHO says surgical masks can only help when used with other preventative measures such as frequent hand-washing.Many other countries are asking its citizens to wear a mask, such as France and the US.Although people in the UK are not being advised to wear masks, they are now being advised to wear face coverings on public transport or in shops.Scotland has recommended people use face coverings , for example fabric such as a scarf, to cover their nose and mouth.Northern Ireland has issued the same advice on face coverings.There are worries inside the NHS thatthe UK government change the policy and advise all Brits wear a mask it could mean there wouldnt be enough for health workers.The UK government has said asking people to wear face coverings isnt the same as asking people to wear face masks.Speaking on May , the UK governments chief scientic adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said wearing face masks had a marginal but positive impact on the spread of infection.Where masks may have a role is where distancing isnt possible, where there might be undue crowding, he added.But Sir Patrick says wearing a mask should not replace social distancing and hand washing - which are both vital. Officials in New York City are urging people to wear masks when they go outside.Mayor Bill de Blasio said coverings for the nose and mouth can be real homegrown and made from a scarf or bandana.It is believed new US Government guidance would suggest non-medical masks, T-shirts or bandanas be used to cover the nose and mouth when outside the home, while professional-grade masks are kept for healthcare workers.In Europe, Austria, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Bosnia-Herzegovina have introduced these measures.Residents in the Philippines have to wear a mask in public, and the same is true in some of the worst-affected provinces in China.In Japan, where masks were already a household staple, the government plans to post two gauze masks to each of the countrys  million households.People in Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand and Taiwan regularly wear masks because of air pollution.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There was no implication that the wicked Tories were plotting to murder us all in our beds. There was no attempt to score cheap party-political points against a PM who is freshly back from death’s door.Yet Starmer’s concern was real. And it is a concern we all share.Why DO we have the worst death toll in Europe There will be time enough for a full-scale inquiry after we have won this war. But we would not be humanwe did not ask the question now ­— is the UK really the sick man of Europe  Are we truly doing so much worse than every other country Much is made of our death toll exceeding that of Italy.It sometimes feels aswe are locked in some grotesque Champions League of human misery.Yet the statistics can be misleading. Spain, for example, does not count deaths in care homes — we do. Germany only counts care home fatalities when Covid- has been diagnosed before death. And China — officially with fewer than , deaths — lies through its teeth, and has lied from the very start.There are factors that no British Government could do anything about. According to Wednesday’s data from the Office for National Statistics, ,, of us are jammed into this overpopulated little island ­— six million more than Italy.The UK is a crowded country and our capital is a global city — the perfect petri dish for a global pandemic.Thirteen million Brits are clinically obese and this virus is particularly murderous among the overweight. There are .million Brits over the age of  and the virus is pitiless among the elderly.Yet it is painfully obvious that massive cock-ups have been made.Because our politicians are always terried of looking racist, British airports were left open for far too long. Around million people were let into the UK between January  and March , even as the virus rampaged across the world.Yet just  travellers arriving from Wuhan were made to self-isolate.We have relied on the likes of China and Turkey to make kit for our health carers, when so much of what they produce is shoddy trash that can’t even be used, including the , gowns from Turkey currently impounded at a Heathrow warehouse after inspectors found the gear was “useless”.London’s Labour Mayor Sadiq Khan cut Tube trains, ensuring NHS staff travelled to work on dangerously packed carriages.So don’t just blame the Tories.Testing has been — still is — pathetically slow, choked by paperwork.But perhaps the biggest mistake of all is that this Government has been far too eager to defer to the “experts” — even when those very same “experts” have got it spectacularly wrong in the past.Professor Neil Ferguson, the key scientic adviser who was the brains behind this national lockdown, was caught this week taking his daily exercise by mounting his married mistress, thereby breaking the strict rules he designed for the rest of us. The bonking boffin’s rank hypocrisy is bad enough.But what should worry us more is Ferguson’s defective crystal ball. Was it made in China  Neil Ferguson’s team produced the we-are-all-doomed research that predicted more than , would die without nationwide house arrest.Yet Professor McPantsdown’s previous predictions are so inaccurate they make Paul The Octopus look like Nostradamus.The preachy prof told us in  that , of us could die from mad cow disease. There were just  deaths.In  Mystic Neil warned that million could die worldwide from bird flu. The final number was .More recently, the randy epidemiologist predicted that Sweden’s relaxed attitude to the virus would lead to , dead Swedes by May . The number was ,.If the sex-mad scientist has been so wrong in the past, then why did the Government gullibly assume that Ferguson was so right about Covid- Common sense should have told us Ferguson is just a fallible scientist who has previously peddled flawed extrapolations — not some bespectacled Yoda. And from the reluctance to close our airports to mistaking Ferguson for God, we have sometimes been short of good old British common sense in recent weeks.Tonight Boris addresses the nation on plans to start very gently easing the lockdown. Many people are understandably worried about going out into the world again.So many have died. So many families have been shattered. So many of the bravest and the best have paid the ultimate price for caring for strangers.But are we really the sick man of Europe Despite our horric death count, this country can feel proud of the way it has conducted itself during this national emergency. Mistakes have certainly been made — just as they were made in the war that we have remembered over the past few days.But the British people have reacted to this historic challenge with patience, resilience and quiet courage. There is a feeling of national unity now that I have never known in my letime.From the courage of NHS workers to the kindness of neighbours, we have witnessed the best of our people during this crisis.The sick man of Europe  Not us.

I wanted him to die,” she told Channel  cheerleaders.The Harry Potter star is the authentic voice of Corbynistas who loathe this Prime Minister with a visceral hatred.If they can’t dance on his grave, the Dementors will do everything possible to kill his political career.Covid- has morphed from a battle for the nation’s health into a lethal struggle to stop Boris leading Britain successfully out of lockdown.An early victory came last night, as the PM unveiled his new slow-motion escape motto.Some ministers hoped for: “Back to work. Go to school. Save the economy.”Instead we heard a feeble “Stay alert. Control the virus. Save lives.”This is a Prime Minister paralysed by indecision, kicking himself for unforced errors, terried of being blamed for every new death.Downing Street is now hostage to the health-and-safety mafia, whipped into line by opportunist public sector unions who have, to coin a phrase, taken back control.Teaching unions, already on guaranteed public sector pay, even want to restrict some online lessons for education-hungry kids.Transport unions are making Tube, rail and bus travel impossible with draconian social distancing.Health unions blame ministers for blunders made by NHS and Public Health England managers.We are in thrall to a shroud-waving public sector “blob” warning of mass fatalitiesthe Government makes one  step.We must heed the experts who swallowed “Bonking Professor” Neil Ferguson’s crackpot forecasts of half a million dead without lockdown.They are the same experts whose advice on testing, PPE and care homes led to one of the world’s biggest death tolls.The nation’s long-term physical, mental and economic health is being held to ransom by a bug which has virtually no impact on children, young adults and most people under .That same low-risk generation faces a potentially catastrophic price for a disease which should leave them and their parents free toalmost immediately to normal le.Coronavirus is an old person’s disease. Out of ten million under-s in Britain, just two have sadly died from Covid-.For under-s, the risk is a “trivial” one or two per million, says respected statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter. Little more than the chance of dying by accident.For over-s, he says the risk is “ten thousand times” as high.This is no consolation for elderly victims, but it does suggest a speedy route back to a new normal with productive under-s kick-starting the economy.Getting people back to work will be hard. The work ethic propelling us out of bed each morning has been sapped by warm spring sunshine, online food and wine and a Treasury- funded cost of living subsidy.People are enjoying paid-for-time with their families. they are also scared witless by sermons about death and disaster and Downing Street’s daily mortality rate briefings.One day there will be a public inquiry. Everyone is covering their tracks.With hindsight, global lockdown is likely to be judged a terrible mistake, forced on a panic-stricken world by China’s authoritarian example.Sweden alone rejected lockdown, keeping schools open, and the economy ticking over, yet its death toll is lower per head than Britain, France, Spain and Italy.Former Swedish medical chief, Professor Johan Giesecke, believes we overreacted to a disease which is just twice as severe as winter flu and cannot be avoided anyway.“I don’t think you can stop it,” he says, “it’s like a tsunami sweeping across Europe.“We should do what we can to slow it so the health service can cope, but let it pass.”But he won’t say this in public.He will have seen the bizarre charges of betrayal and “fat shaming” against singer Adele for daring to lose seven stone.Yet Liverpool University researchers say obesity increases the risk of death from coronavirus by  per cent.Boris should say loud and clear that fat can be fatal. Losing weight prolongs le.Our health service, by the way, has coped brilliantly.Prof Giesecke says there are three golden rules: “Wash your hands, keep social distance, trust the people.”After Brexit, Boris should know more than most he can trust the people.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Now make another cm cut that runs parallel to the bottom to make a rectangle that can be thrown away.Step four: Now, to make the ties that secure the mask you need two long strips of fabric. Then unfold the main piece of fabric and place over the mouth and nose to secure. This then needs to be tied around the head and around the neck.As well as the simple four step face mask , the government also issued guidance on how to make a sewn face covering.In order to make that you will need a needle and thread, scissors, two cm x cm squares of cotton fabric and two cm pieces of elastic .This process is a little more complicated but can also be completed in just four steps...Step one: Taking your fabric cut out two cm x cm squares of cotton fabric and then stack the two squares on top of each other.Step two: Fold over one side by   cm and hem, then do the same on the opposite side. Make two channels by folding the double layer of fabric over .cm along each side and stitching this down.Step three: Now for the tricky part, you need to run a cmof elastic, string or cloth strip through the wider hem on each side of the face covering. These will be used as the ear loops and you can use a large needle to thread this through.Step four: Pull on the elastic and adjust the fabric so it fits well across your face. The elastic loops should then fit over your ears.The advice from the government however came with a strict warning that people must use materials they already have at home and not try to order PPE online that could otherwise go to to frontline NHS services.It also stated that face coverings did not need to be worn outdoors while exercising.The government also stated that they did not need to be worn by children or by people who may find them dficult to put on themselves. It also stated that the coverings do not need to be worn in schools for children who are still attending.Health Minister Jo Churchill said the strategy has been guided by the science and that thanks to updated advice today, people should consider wearing the masks in public spaces where social distancing is not possible.You do not need a clinical mask which are prioritised for our healthcare workers.Instead a face covering is sufficient and we encourage people to make these at home with items they will already own, she added.This is while Professor Chris Whitty said the face coverings were just added precautions and highlighted that the most effective way to protect yourself from the virus was to stay at home.Previous guidance from the World Health Organisation has stated that when people had worn face masks for prolonged periods of time, they were more likely to put others at risk by not strictly following other hygiene standards such as hand washing and social distancing.When issuing the guidance on face covering making, the government highlighted that it did no endorse any particular way of mask making and that children should be supervised at all timesmaking the masks at home.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There are very limited places to eat, other than takeaways.We do not believe that this is staying alert - to undertake a long, unnecessary journey.At this time we ask you to stay away, and in the comfort of your own home, plan a future break to Cornwall when it is safe to do so.The bottom line though is that we dont want people turning up in Cornwall on Wednesday.Nancy Platts, leader of Brighton and Hove City Council, said: We want a slow, steady and safe progression towards lockdown lting.The council released a statement, saying: We want to make sure we are stepping forward in a measured way. We know restrictions will need to stay in place for a long time to come.We want the restrictions to be lted carefully in a positive direction. Our priority is to keep people who live in the city safe. One concern is around how residents can maintain physical distancing in our busy citywe have an influx of visitors.The Prime Minister has said that hospitality and leisure businesses are not likely to open before July. The shops and attractions are still closed and we want people who do not live in Brighton and Hove to stay away.James Mason, chief executive of Welcome to Yorkshire, said: In March we asked people to stay away from our many beauty spots - coastline and countryside - to prevent the spread of Covid-.We welcome the road map to recovery but with caution. Please respect that these communities are not yet able to cope with tourism.The Forestry Commission also urged people to stay at home and only travel to woodsthey live nearby and are able to walk there.A spokesman told MailOnline: Although this is great news and we look forward to welcoming visitors back to the nations forests as soon as we can, our priority is to keep people safe.Please continue to avoid making unnecessary journeys and do not travel to the nations forests. Local people can still walk and cycle to our forests but must follow government rules on social distancing.South Lakes police took to Twitter and told would-be travellers to take a long hard look at their conscious before heading to the Lake District.Sharing a map which showed the North West as the worst affected area of the UK, they said: Before considering travelling to #Cumbria #LakeDistrict please grab a brew, examine this map, and take a long hard look at your own conscience.We urge you to use common sense and to continue to exercise close to your own home.

But the safe corridor will not kick in until at least halfway through next month.Entry into France is still heavily restricted until at least June , after Mr Macron extended the need for all visitors to the country to fill out a form stating their reason for travel.And for the moment, authorities on both sides of the Channel have also made it clear that visits to holiday homes remain banned.

Non-contact sports such as tennis, golf and angling will be allowed.People can play only with those in their own household or one other person and must keep two metres apart.Basketball courts can open but people will be allowed to play team sports only with fellow household members.And it will be possible to meet one other person from another household in an outdoor space as long as they keep two metres apart.Speaking in the Commons today, Mr Johnson said: “You can now walk, sit and rest in parks.”Step  from June  could see households choosing one other group to include in their “double bubble”.The move — aimed at limiting the risk of inter-household transmissions of the virus — could also help familiesto work by two households sharing childcare.Government scientic advisers said the “bubbles” could include the over-s, despite this age group being in the “clinically vulnerable” category.But the plan would not apply to around . million in the “clinically extremely vulnerable group” who have cancer or other illnesses — many of whom are aged over .They are “strongly advised to stay at home at all times and avoid any face-to-face contact” — known as “shielding”.The Government’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty said: “We are looking at how to balance those risks in terms of households who are over s.”Primary school children could also start ing to school. But again the moves have to be deemed deemed safe by SAGE.Step  from July  could see hairdressers able to open alongside beauty salons, restaurants, hotels, bigger cinemas and some pubs — as long as they keep customers two metres apart.But busier places like gyms, nightclubs, sports arenas and crowded bars could remain closed into next year.The roadmap said “venues that attract large crowds” will have to stay shut until “signicantly later” as the risk of the virus spreading fast inside them is very high.Ministers will allow “cultural and sporting events” to take place behind closed doors — to be shown on TV from June onwards - ­heralding theof the Premier League and Formula One.The PM told MPs theof major sport “will provide a much- needed boost to morale”.The Government document also stated that the over-s and pregnant women “should continue to take particular care” and keep contact with others to a minimum.Visits to holiday homes are still banned, No said — in a reminder ahead of the next May bank holiday and the half-term break.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But a new book claims to have solved the  mystery once and for all - and suggests a far more disturbing explanation.British researcher Nick Redfern says he has uncovered evidence which shows it was part of a trial to weaponise hallucinogens on the battlefield.Boffins at secret research lab Porton Down in Wiltshire were allegedly behind the project to manipulate the minds of the enemy.US-based Nick, , said: Based upon their personal encounters, many of the military personnel who were present at the time believed that something extraterrestrial came down in those dark woods.

The shocking truth of a forty-year-old mystery can now be revealed.The whole situation was nothing but an incredible, disturbing, series of tests to see just how far the human mind could be manipulated - and how such technologies could potentially, one day, play signicant roles on the battlefield.In his controversial new book - The Rendlesham Forest UFO Conspiracy - Nick suggests they used hallucinogens to affect some of the men and advanced holograms to create images of UFOs.The incident took place over three nights between  and  December outside the twin Suffolk air bases of RAF Woodbridge and RAF Bentwaters.Military personnel, including the deputy base commander Col Charles Halt, witnessed strange lights in the forest and hovering above the bases.The incident sparked questions in the House of Parliament but defence chiefs at the time said it was of no defence signicance.It has even been suggested that it was a prank launched by the SAS in revenge for a brutal interrogation of one of their men days earlier.Nick, who has written over  books on unsolved mysteries, added: Clearly, exposing military personnel to advanced hologram-based technology in those woods, and late at night, would have been a perfect way of gauging just how successfully the manufactured visions had achieved their goals.Those goals were: the creation of holographic UFOs that could interact with not just the environment, but with those who were in its presence, too.

The Government cannot afford to repeat such a shambles.“Stay home, save lives” was a simple and effective message. The next steps are far more nuanced.They did not need another vague Churchillian rallying call. That merely sowed confusion, even among the PM’s deputy Dominic Raab and the staunchest Tories, and exposed Boris to a tsunami of snark on TV and social media.It needed instead the level of detail we eventually saw in the Government’s guidance released yesterday afternoon — and then in Boris’s Commons QA.Supporters claimed the PM’s new “stay alert” message was merely common sense any fool could grasp. That misses the point. We are being asked to live in highly unusual and restrictive ways. One person’s common sense is another’s idea of dangerous risk.Our circumstances are all dferent and specics are important — especially when police are to hand out increased fines for transgressions.But while the Government’s recent messaging has been poor, we at least now have our first welcome, albeit ­tentative, steps out of this nightmare:Outside exercise without limit, including the freedom to drive for a day out. The first chance in weeks to see a friend. All assuming social distancing.More solid guidance on masks. Precious little relief on schools, but the glimmer of some sport. Some, many Sun readers included, are being told toto work, though they may justiably fear it is unsafe.Their jobs also make them some of those most likely to die from Covid-.Their firms, factories and sites must bust a gut to ensure their safety, take every precaution and heed reasonable concerns. The grim reality, though, is that our economy must get moving again.It is typical of the infantile Left to complain that profits are being put before people. The Government is not a bottomless well of money. That’s why Rishi Sunak is limbering up to cut the sums paid to furloughed staff. He has to.Only a healthy economy and the taxes it generates can keep public services afloat, the NHS especially.Bankrupt Britain with an endless lockdown and you wreck those too. And far more lives are then lost.DONALD Trump is now harbouring an international fugitive.His case for refusing Britain’s request to extradite Harry Dunn’s alleged killer Anne Sacoolas is blown apart.The Interpol Red Notice, ordering her arrest outside the US, shows the “diplomatic immunity” under which she left the UK after the death crash was bogus.Even the US public want her to face the music.

Many, many tears. A slight joyous moment I guess similar to when the CPS put the charge of death by dangerous driving in place on the Friday before Christmas.But the elation is always short-lived because we shouldnt have to be going through this. It should have never have happened. We shouldnt be in this situation.Dad Tim Dunn said: Its been a massive step for us as a family. It has been a real hard time.In lockdown you have more time to think and you reflect on stuff so it makes it harder.But this news is great news and I am sure this is going to be helping us down the road - its got to be a good thing.Piers called the ordeal a disgrace as he told the parents he wanted to see them get justice.Charlotte said they had only just been able to get back into a routine when the coronavirus outbreak hit the UK and talked about the struggle of not being able to see physically see people for support.Charlotte tearfully said: You cant offload to anybody because you cant see them.You know its brilliant, we have all these internet connections and everything now so you can virtually see them, but to not have those hugs and those cuddles that you really need at a time like this is really far, far more dficult than I thought it would ever be at the beginning.She is currently in lockdown with Harrys stepfather Bruce Charles and son Niall.She added: The three of us are together all day everyday. When Niall comes out of his bedroom, which isnt very often - just to eat.We saw some smiles from him yesterday, which was wonderful, but hes struggling.He had only just got back to the point prior to Covid where he was actually starting to spend an hour maybe two hours a week with a friend or two and of course thats all been taken away as well.Susanna explained that Sacoolas has been charged but would have toto the UK in order to face criminal proceedings.Charlotte replied: We totally understand that, but we shouldnt have to be going through this. She should never have ever gone back to the US in the first place.But the one major thing I think for me that came out with this Interpol notice yesterday is that it encourages us and confirms to us that the UK authorities are finally on the same page as us because they cannot issue a red Interpol notice to anybody that was or is covered by diplomatic immunity.So that gives us confidence that finally after eight of the nine months of losing Harry and the fighting we have done you know the UK authorities are clearly on the same page as us to have taken the decision to put that red Interpol notice out.A Red Notice is a request to global law enforcement organisation to locate a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action.On its website, Interpol states it is an international wanted persons notice, but it is not an arrest warrant.Harry, , was killed on August ,  when his motorcycle crashed into an SUV driven by Sacoolas in Northamptonshire.The -year-old mother of three left a US spy base at RAF Croughton and drove on the wrong side of the road when she hit the young motorcyclist.Sacoolas claimed diplomatic immunity and was able toto the US and has since refused toto the UK, sparking international outrage.She was charged with causing death by dangerous driving last December.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in January that Sacoolas had to come back to the UK to face trial.But an extradition request submitted by the Home Office was swtly rejected by Pompeo.Boris Johnson has warned US President Donald Trump that failing to extradite Sacoolas would be a denial of justice.Today, the US State Department said Pompeos decision to refuse an extradition request for Harry alleged killer was final.A spokeswoman said the State Department maintained the position that Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity from criminal jurisdiction.Labours shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said the decision by Interpol to issue a red notice highlights the clear and repeated failings of the Foreign Office.She added: Labour is working on a cross-party basis to establish a parliamentary inquiry into how this was allowed to happen and we will continue to raise this with the United States authorities.The Foreign Secretary must now urgently come to the House to explain these failings, and set out how he will engage with his counterparts in the United States to resolve this situation and provide much-needed closure for Harry Dunns family and loved ones.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Absolutely workplaces need to follow the guidelines on making a workplace safe for Covid, so that is very important.Critically, everybody who can work from home should continue to work from home.When asked a second time, the rattled minister replied: Well, employment law has not changed, but that isnt the point.The point is that businesses and employees should be working together to make the best of a very dficult situation.It comes after Boris Johnson published a y plan yesterday to get the country back to school and work without risking a second wave of infections - but many key details were missing.Further guidance is only expected later this week, leaving many Brits confused about the new rules.Throughout his interviews this morning, Mr Hancock insisted that everything is fine with the new roadmap guidance.He told Sky News: The principles are really clear and the public has been sensible so far.The Great British public have really understood what social distancing means, why we need to do it... the principles are outside is better than inside, stay two metres away, wash your hands and clean the surfaces, and see as few people as you can, outside of your household because that virus spreads but we do also at the same time need to get people back to work.Clearing up confusion around the new social distancing rules - which allow Brits who keep their distance to meet up with one other person in the park - Mr Hancock confirmed that it is fine for this to be a dferent person every day from tomorrow.When asked by Sky News  the changes meant Brits could see a dferent person each day in the park, he said: “Yes at greater than two metres.“Being outside is safer than being inside but it is not zero risk.“We are making some baby steps, some relaxation but we are doing it very very carefully because we don’t want that R-rate to get higher than one.”"},{"url":null,"title":"furlough scheme set to wind down from july as lockdown eased rishi sunak to announce","story":"The Chancellor was last night finalising details of tweaks to the taxpayer-funded job retention scheme, which is currently paying . million workers  per cent of their wages - up to a limit of £, per month.The scheme is already due to expire in June but the Chancellor is expected to allow employers to furlough their staff part-time in future to help them ease themselves back to operation, with the possibility of the rest of the wages being topped up by the Government.He is likely to extend it until September, but he is also set to to reduce the taxpayer-funded support down to  or even  per cent.Mr Sunak, who will announce the changes in the Commons at lunchtime, will use the announcement to attempt to slow the alarming rate of people claiming Universal Credit.Yesterday ministers revealed that the Government has now processed around two million Universal Credit claims since mid-March, when the lockdown was imposed.Yesterday Boris Johnson all-but confirmed yesterday that the scheme would be continued in some form beyond June.He told MPs: “It has been one of the most assailant, the most important feature of this country’s response so far to this crisis - that we have looked after some of the lowest paid in our society, the hardest working people and we will continue to do so.”Asked by The Sun what message he would give to people who work in gyms, nightclubs and other leisure and hospitality jobs who are facing months off work, the PM said: “I do believe that they will recover. “We have an ambition to get at least some hospitality going by July , that will be a tough ask, it will be hard to achieve and it depends on a great deal of conditionality that I’ve set out. But that’s the ambition, that’s the target that we’re setting, so at least some of the jobs will start to come back.“And then over the medium term, I’ve absolutely no doubt that the UK economy is immensely resilient and will come back. But we’re going to have to think a lot more –we can’t get a vaccine fast then we’re going to have to think a lot more how we make our businesses, our lives Covid-secure while continuing with economic activity. But we’re a very ingenious bunch, the Brits, I’m sure we’ll find ways forward, and that is what we intend to do.”But Labour has urged him not to cut the scheme too soon - for fear of harming the economy and for jobs to be lostThe Resolution Foundation urged him to keep the scheme open longer for workers in the hardest hit sectors in order to acknowledge the Government’s roadmap revealed some sectors will have to stay shut for at least the rest of this year.It also wants the Government to allow partial furloughing from June onwards - enabling employees toto work for some hours, while still receiving  per cent of their wages for the hours that they remained furloughed.Currently the scheme requires furloughed employees not to be working at all in order to qualy for the scheme.The Federation of Small Businesses have long-campaigned for employers to furlough staff part-time. FSB boss Mike Cherry said last night: “The vast majority of small employers have furloughed staff and they’re telling us loud and clear that the ability to do so on a part-time basis as we move towards recovery will be key to keeping their operations afloat. For firms that don’t have the green light to open until July at the very earliest in particular, we need to see schemes extended signicantly – not least the job retention scheme.”Treasury Committee chairman Mel Stride suggested a tapering down of the furloughing scheme to protect jobs and ease the burden on the Exchequer.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

According to the NHS, the disease primarily affects children under five years of age.These include:Although it mainly affects children, Kawasaki disease can also be found in adults. The chances of this, however, is typically very low.The blood vessels become swollen which can lead to complications in the coronary arteries . Kawasaki disease can cause aneurysms which can lead to a heart attack and heart disease.James Bradley said he had seen a six-year-old who also had a pinkish, raised and itchy rash on their belly button and back.Speaking to the Huffington Post he added: I’ve seen other patients that it’s more like an eruption of small red bumps, which we’ve seen mostly in patients who are admitted with more serious infections going on. It’s hard for us to knowthis is a viral manestation or an immune response.On the increased number of patients presenting with Covid toes he said a lot of such skin manestations are a representation of what is going on internally with the organs.Covid toes can be found on the side or sole of the foot and in some cases has been seen on hands and fingers.The European Journal of Pediatric Dermatology said there had been a epidemic of cases in Italy involving children and young adults.It is a condition that had not previously been linked to the virus.Bradley added that when you get blueish and reddish toes, it’s either thrombosis or damage to the vessels.Other specialists have claimed that there are a iety of skin issues to look out for and said skin conditions in Covid patients can be “extraordinarily erse”.Dermatologist Harold Lancer said hive-like rashes are the most common conditions he has seen.At the beginning of this month there were numerous reports of children experiencing rashes and developing Kawasaki like symptoms.The condition causes inflation in the blood and can present during or after a Covid infection.Doctors have said that such rashes can be present in people who are not suffering from any other Covid symptoms and data from both China and Italy, two of the first hot spots of the virus, states that two to  percent of patients also had skin conditions.While it’s important to seek help from medical professionalsyou think you have the coronavirus, specialists also say that what you have put onto your skin can also cause reactions.During the pandemic many people may have had to switch their usual brands of washing detergent and shower products due to a lack of availability, while others may have taken the opportunity to try something new in their skin care regime.Dermatologists have said to keep a log of any new medication you may have been taking or anything new you have been using on your skin in order to determine whether it is in fact this that has caused a reaction.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If you see hand sanitising stations anywhere, use them.Using contactless payment wherever you can reduces the risk of contracting any germs, and only take what you really need with you so you dont have to lug about a big bag.Take note of any signs directing where you should and shouldnt sit, and stick to them, while trying not to touch any surfaces you dont have to. If you do, do not touch your face and wash or sanitise your hands as soon as you can.New guidance issued by the Department for Transport on how to travel safely suggests facing away from other people while travelling - something that Tube travellers should be well versed in already.It acknowledges that there may be situations where you cant keep a suitable distance from people, such as on busier services or at peak times.The document states: In these cases you should avoid physical contact, try to face away from other people.The risk of infection increases the closer you are to another person with the virus and the amount of time you spend in close contact.It is wise to plan your journey in advance so you know the route well and dont have to spend any longer on public transport or in a more crowded area than you need to.If you are driving to and from work, be aware there are likely to be more cyclists and pedestrians about.And anyone who needs to use airports will need to be aware of mask rules in certain spots, after three British airports now require all passengers to cover their faces.Manchester, Stansted and East Midlands airports have decided to impose the conditions, and some airlines are also planning to introduce this as a rule.But while lockdown is slowly easing the rules still state thatyou do not need to leave home to work, or leave home at all, then you shouldnt.Brits are now able to exercise as much as they wish outdoors, while only with members of their households still and keeping socially distanced.From tomorrow lockdown weary Brits will be able to meet up with one other person from outside their household - keeping two metres from each other outdoors - as the country continues to battle the virus.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: Transport operators and staff have been working hard to ensure that people who need to get to work are able to do so, including crucial NHS workers and all those on the frontline of the fight against the virus. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Alongside the cycling and walking revolution we are launching, and clear guidance to passengers and operators published today, we can all play our part by following the advice and reducing pressure on public transport.If we take these steps, all those who need to use public transport should feel confident that they can do.Britains real coronavirus death toll has passed ,, concerning new analysis suggests. There were , deaths involving Covid- in England and Wales up to May , according to the Office of National Statistics .It comes as yesterday ministers revealed a fresh five-step plan to try and keep all workplaces safe from coronavirus. Kids could be sent to dferent schools and class sizes cut in half under plan to exit lockdown, it was revealed yesterday.And all school kids in England will be sent back to class for a month before the summer holidays.Class sizes will be slashed to no more than , and pupils sat apart to try to limit any spread of coronavirus.And No revealed that parents who refuse to send their kids back to class will not be slapped with the usual £ fines for non-attendance.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

set up to challenge the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies - have claimed the current strategy is potentially dangerous.In a report released by the group led by former Chief Scientic Advisor Sir David King, they said: Without suppressionwe shall inevitably see a more rapidof local epidemics resulting in more deaths and potentially further partial or national lockdowns, with the economic costs that will incur.The Government should take all necessary measures to control the virus through suppression and not simply managing its spread.Evidence must show that COVID- transmission is controlled before measures are relaxed.We detect ambivalence in the Governments strategic response with some advisers promoting the idea of simply flatting the curve or ensuring the NHS is not overwhelmed.We find this attitude counter-productive and potentially dangerous.Independent Sage targeted the Governments failure to bring in comprehensive contact tracing from the start of the epidemic.Professor of Virology at UCL Deenan Pillay said the UK could have suppressed coronavirus within three weeksthere had been strong systems in place to track new cases.He said: The countries that have doneat speed have shown that they could suppress the virus within about  weeks and get the deaths right down. You must always find the virus, every case, test for themyou can butyou cant, traceisolate. Co-director of the Newcastle University Centre for Excellence in Regulatory Science Professor Allyson Pollock said: It was a puzzle as to why contact tracing stopped on March .We were given two reasons - that it wasnt effective and there werent sufficient resources. needs to rebuild contact tracing locally through teams, you will need tens of thousands of contact tracers.Professor Pollock said the country could easily utilise the , people who signed up to volunteer for the NHS, many of whom have not been contacted, to build local teams.The group said the most effective way forward would be local contact tracing - and said using a centralised app and system was bewildering.The experts warned the Governments new Stay Alert message was confusing and not clear enough to ensure Brits followed social distancing rules strictly enough to stop the spread of COVID-.Professor of Health Psychology and Director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at University College London Professor Susan Michie said: The concern about message isto be very consistent and very clear particularly in terms of what people should be doing.With that slogan it is not very obvious what stay alert means or what someone should dowhile staying alert they identy something that is not yet defined they should be staying alert for.Sir David King has repeatedly criticised Sage, lead by Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty and Chief Scientic Advisor Sir Patrick Vallance for failing to be transparent with their modelling - crucial to the Governments coronavirus strategy.He said today: Whats very important is is transparency, we are demonstrating what it looks like to have expert information in the public domain, what we have published is open to the Government and also open to the public. is to demonstrate what an independent Sage group should look like -

even though Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are not telling people to go back to work yet.All sectors will be able to get help, the Chancellor promised, not just those who desperately need assistance.One option discussed was that furlough money would be reduced to  per cent after fears that workers were addicted to the scheme.Mr Sunak said: Employers currently using the scheme will be able to bring furloughed employees back part-time.Our message is simple: we stood behind Britains workers and businesses, and we will stand behind them as we come out of it.Nobody who is on the furlough scheme wants to be on this scheme.People up and down this country believe in the dignity of their work, going to work, providing for their families, its not their fault their business has been asked to close or asked to stay at home.It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson yesterday published a -page guide on getting Britain out of lockdown.The PM gave a speech on Sunday night and followed up with a three-step plan to ease lockdown measures.Starting this week, those who cant work from home were encouraged to get back to work.In step two, not before June , there will be a phased reopening of non-essential shops and kids will begin to go back to school.The final step, not before July , will see the hospitality sector reopen with social distancing with cinemas, pubs, gyms and hairdressers expected to be among the last.The Government will also explore ways to support furloughed workers who wish to do additional training or learn new skills during this period.Employers will have to promise to top up the rest of the workers wages to  per cent to continue to take part in the scheme, it was claried by officials today.They wontt be able to just give workers  per cent of their wages from the Government and not contribute anything to the rest.But critics suggested that many businesses who cant afford that will have to lay off staff rather than find the cash to top up their employers wages.However the government does not envisage making signicant payouts to public sector employees as they believe most will continue offering essential services.Where employers are receiving public funding for staff costs, they will be expected to continue using these funds to pay staff rather than applying for the furlough scheme.If you are working at reduced hours and pay, you will not be eligible for furlough and it will be up to your employer to pay you as normal.You must have created and started a PAYE payroll scheme on or before March ,  and have a UK bank account. Professor Len Shackleton, IEA Editorial and Research Fellow, said: The longer businesses are dependent on the furlough scheme, and unable to begin reorganising staff and adjusting their business models, the less likely it is that people will have jobs toto once the lockdown ends.It will also delay iniduals plans to seek other jobs where this is clearly going to be necessary.It would have been better to spell out much more clearly what the government intends now, rather than delaying the detail of what Mr Sunak proposes.BCC Director General Adam Marshall warned: Over the coming months, the Government should continue to listen to business and evolve the scheme in line with what’s happening on the ground.Further support may yet be needed for companies who are unable to operate for an extended period, or those who face reduced capacity or demand due to ongoing restrictions.And Federation of Small Business chairman, Mike Cherry added: We await further detail on the contributions that will be required of small employers after July.We need to ensure that those obligations are affordable for the many businesses that have had no revenue coming in for months now, but still have fixed overheads to worry about.TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady welcomed todays news and said it was good for workers.She said: We are pleased ministers have listened to unions and extended the job retention scheme to the autumn. This will be a big relief for millions.Changing the rules to allow part-time working is key to enabling a gradual and safeto work.And maintaining the rate at  per cent is a win for the pay packets of working families.As the economic consequences of Covid- become clear, unions will keep pushing for a job guarantee scheme to make sure everyone has a decent job. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Years R,  and , along with nurseries and childminders, are expected to resume lessons followed by Years , ,  and  later in June. But primary schools will look radically dferent to how they did before, new guidance confirms. The virus will be managed by having half-sized classes, one-way corridors and staggered break and drop-off times. Soft furnishings will be removed and whole classes will have to go home for two weeksone child gets sick with Covid-.But teaching unions have warned that the plan is reckless and the ambition for all year groups toto primary schools by summer is not feasible. Almost , people have signed a petition demanding the option for parents not to send kids back to school unless they feel itaposs safe. Primary school pupils are going back first because they fall less seriously ill with Covid-, and because the impact on them missing education is the worst.Secondary school pupils are not expected back until September, apart from some contact for years  and . So how will primary schools look dferent  Weaposve looked at  key points in the government guidance. . Classes will have split in half - with just  pupils in each room  Primary schools have been told to split classes in half - with just  pupils in each room. And those groups must be kept consistent, with pupils in one group not mixing with friends in another group. The reason is the government accepts young children wonapost be able to stay two metres apart at all times. So the government is accepting thatthere is an outbreak, it might spread in a class. But that class will be smaller, minimising the size of any outbreak. Smaller class sizes will also allow desks to be put as far apart as possible. If there arenapost enough teachers, teaching assistants will take classes. . If one child gets Covid-, the whole class will have to go home for  weeks  If one child tests positive for Covid-, their whole class of  - plus the teacher - will need to go home and self-isolate for  days. This doesnapost need to happen the moment a child gets a cough or a fever. If a child falls ill, they should go home and their entire household should self-isolate for  days. While theyaposre self-isolating, the child or parents should then order a home coronavirus test or go to a drive-through testing centre. If the child tests negative, they can go back to school. If they test positive, their whole class of  must then go into isolation at home for two weeks. Their classmatesapos families do not need to self-isolate too - unless that classmate then gets symptoms, in which case that household self-isolates for  days. If a wider outbreak is detected in a school, Public Health England could advise entire year groups or even the whole school to shut. . Teachers wearing PPE like masks to deal with sick kids  Teachers will need to wear PPEtheyaposre caring for a child who has fallen ill at school. Teachers are advised to keep a two-metre distance, but wear protective kitthis isnapost possible. If contact with the child or young person is necessary, then gloves, an apron and a face mask should be worn by the supervising adult, the guidance says. If a risk assessment determines that there is a risk of splashing to the eyes, for example from coughing, spitting, or vomiting, then eye protection should also be worn. Sick children who are waiting to be picked up should ideally be moved to an isolated room behind a closed door - but with the window open for ventilation. Andthey need the toilet, they should use a separate bathroom to everyone  which is then cleaned afterwards using standard products.The guidance says most staff in education settings will not require PPE when they open up. Children and staff are not required to wear a face covering or face mask in schools and early years settings.It should only be worn by a supervising adulta pupil becomes unwell with symptoms of coronavirus while in the setting. . Soft furniture will be removed The advice suggests nurseries and schools should remove soft furnishings, soft toys and toys that are hard to clean - including with intricate parts. . Corridors will have one-way systems Schools should consider introducing one-way circulation, or placing a ider down the middle of the corridor, to keep young people apart, the guidance says. . Staggered breaks and new drop-off and pick-up times The guidelines advise schools to stagger lunch and break times, as well as drop-off and pick-up times, to reduce the number of pupils moving around. This could mean changing start and finish times for dferent pupils or having staggered pick-ups. Start and finish times will be clearly communicated to parents and carers alongside any other new arrangements, the guidance says.  . Fewer school buses Children, young people and parents are being encouraged to walk or cycle where possible. As with everyone , people are being urged to avoid public transportat all possible. The guidance says schools, trusts and councils should work together on how to apply this guidance to home-to-school transport such as school buses. . Your child canapost see some friends in their own class Children are being halved into groups of  to create little aposbubblesapos where the virus wonapost spread further. This means the consistent groups will be kept from mixing with other pupils during the day. So half the Bears class of Year  will not be able to mix with the other half of the Bears class of Year . . They may have to be shted to another school The guidance accepts some education settings wonapost be able to achieve half-sized classes due to a lack of space. Those schools should discuss the options with their council or trust - but they could include some children attending a nearby school.

But Mr Hancockaposs response comes despite complaints across the political ide about mixed messaging over the roadmap to ease the lockdown. From tomorrow people in England will be able to take unlimited exercise, drive to beauty spots, sit in the park with one person from another household and play golf, tennis and angling - all while staying two metres away. A roadmap also lays out how schools and non-essential shops can begin to reopen from June , folllowed by some in the hospitality industry from July . But the launch of the roadmap has been hit by a string of rows over confused messaging. They include:England now has dferent restrictions to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland after national leaders disagreed with Mr Johnson. The government replaced its stay at home slogan with stay alert, then later explained staying alert includes staying at home as much as possible. Dominic Raab said you could meet both parents in a public place from two metres away - but he was incorrect. Only two people, one from each household, may meet in a public place in a socially distanced way. Boris Johnson told the Commons last week that changes would be made on Monday, but in fact they are coming into force on Wednesday. Boris Johnson said those who canapost work from home shouldto work this week. After alarm from unions, it emerged he meant Wednesday - but that only became clear on Monday morning. The government said childminders couldto work in England from this week, only to later clary they will onlyfrom June.A live event held by the Mirror yesterday was bombarded with hundreds of questions about how the restrictions will be eased. And a member of the public, Pooja from Solihull, blasted the Prime Minister last night over the vague instructions to the public. While explaining why the instructions were perfectly clear, Mr Johnson briefly switched to speaking French. Even the former Tory leader William Hague today said Boris Johnson should consider changing his approach.Lord Hague said the approach of delivering a straightforward and direct message paid off in the early day of the battle against coronavirus - but more nuance and detail was needed now. The Prime Minister has told the country stay alert, control the virus and save lives in new messaging, but the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have stuck with the stay home message.Writing in the Daily , Lord Hague said Mr Johnsonaposs team deserved credit for their prowess in coining slogans like Get Brexit Done and Take Back Control.But he added: Such slogans also have their limitations, particularly when the simplicities of campaigning are succeeded by the complexities of governing. Slogans donapost workyou have to change them repeatedly, endlessly explain them, ordferent versions are employed at the same time. Mr Hancock clashed over the subject with BBC Radio aposs Today programme. When told workers were left confused after thinking they had to go back on Monday, only to be told belatedly it was Wednesday, he said: “Well I thinkthat’s the biggest complaint the Today programme has, then I think things are fine. He added: The truth is that people really understand the message, people understand what ‘Stay Alert’ means, it means… er, and people understand that together we need to control the virus, and make sure people follow the social distancing rules.

Publishing guidance for both passengers and operators the Department for Transport warned that “there will be times and some settings on public transport where social distancing is not possible”. But with the Government calling on those who cannot work from home in certain industries toto work from tomorrow, it is inevitable that more people will be getting public transport. So here is the governmentaposs advice to make sure you can make any trip you have to take as safe as possible. Do not travelyouaposre unwell or clinically extremely vulnerablePeople have been asked not to take any non-essential travel by public transport, but evenyour trip is essential you shouldnapost take ityou have any coronavirus symptoms or are part of the vulnerable groups, people with underlying conditions, who the Government have urged to shield themselves.If youaposre self-isolating you should also, obviously, avoid public transport Check ahead and travel when quieter Even as public transport routes begin to step up activity, there is still likely to be disruption to the nornal arrangements, so the government is asking people to plan a head by identying alternative routes and options in case of unexpected disruption. They also suggest thatcan, travel at off-peak times, and you should ask your employer to consider letting you start late or leave early to avoid peaks.  Buy tickets ahead of time Where possible, book your travel online through your transport provider’s ticketing app or website. Consider contactless payment to buy tickets. Try and keep social distance If you can take a less busy route, you should try and obviously where possible you should keep metres away from people. But where that isnapost possible the advice is to keep the time you spend nears others as short as possible and avoid physical contact. It adds: Be aware of the surfaces you touch. Be careful not to touch your face. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow when coughing or sneezing. To avoid crowds it suggests you try to start or end your journey using a station or mode of transport you know to be quieter or more direct. For instance, walk the first or last mile of your journey, or alight at an earlier station, where this is possible.  Wear a face covering and travel lightly While the guidance stresses that wearing a face covering is not a legal requirement it stresses thatyou can wear one while on public transport you should. And it suggests making a list of items that you need to take with you in order to minimise the luggage you take. Also, the advice suggests you donapost eat or drink on public transport. Pay attention to the safety instructions around you and follow basic travel ettiquette Operators have been told they must set out schemes to try and make travelling more secure and this will mean restrictions on where you stand or how to queue. It goes without saying that you should follow these. It may mean going into or out of a dferent entrance or only boarding from a particular part of the train or bus.

Of the first eight children, aged four to , who were treated - seven required the use of a ventilator. The -year-old later tested positive for coronavirus. The “cluster” of cases was detected in south east London - focused in the Woolwich and Southwark areas of the capital. Parents have been urged to not delay in seeking medical helptheir child is unwell. Doctors who uncovered the disease at Evelina London Children’s Hospital say it is similar to Kawasaki disease - a rare inflammatory disease which mainly affects children under the age of five. It can cause high temperatures, swelling and a red rash, and requires immediate hospital treatment. Hospitals nationwide have been alerted to what experts describe as a “new phenomenon” linked to coronavirus. Dr Sara Hanna, the Evelina’s medical director said: “We probably saw the first case in the middle of March.  “We had a child admitted with something very like Kawasaki – a bit like something we call toxic shock syndrome. “In the last two weeks, we have just seen this cluster of children where some of them look very like Kawasaki. “They have a high persistent fever, they have got red eyes, they have got a rash, they have got swollen hands and feet.” Doctors said blood tests were not testing positive for the virus in children, but other indicators were “remarkably similar” to those seen in adults with Covid-. Antibodies indicating recovery from Covid- were later found in about half the children. And Dr Hanna described the timing of the outbreak of the disease as “suspicious”.

Boris Johnsonaposs -page blue print for easing Britain out of lockdown includes the possibility of expanding household groups to allow those isolated some more social contact. While details are vague for certain sectors, including over-s, the Prime Minister has reiterated the elderly are not in the aposshieldedapos group of highly vulnerable - implying they could be allowed to mix with other family soon.People vulnerable to the virus, including those with underlying health problems were told mid-March to stay indoors for  weeks - which is now likely to be extended.Confusingly, this group did initially appear to include all over-s. But Mr Johnson said yesterday: Over s need to understand they need to take care but itaposs not quite right to say theyaposre shielded. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.    He also said: All the rules of social distancing of course apply to them and apply particularly strongly to them, but otherwise they can go about their lives. The Government has asked the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesto look into the safety aspects involved of allowing households to come together, according to the report.  This strategy could be based on the New Zealand model of household aposbubblesapos which could allow two households to come into contact, for example to share childcare. But thereaposs no confirmed date as to when this may come into being. Those who are not in the shielded group but who are more vulnerable to Covid-, such as the over-s, should continue to take particular care to minimise contact with others outside their households, but do not need to be shielded, says the blueprint.

As Chief Nursing Officer for England Ruth May offered her thanks to her “incredible staff”, we speak to nurses around the country who tell of battling the virus... Stuart Tuckwood Critical care nurse Stuart, , from London, has been nursing for six years and moved to work in intensive care during the pandemic. He was inspired to become a nurse after working as a carer and seeing the huge dference his nursing colleagues made. He is now the national officer for nursing at the union UNISON.  Stuart says: “I have to pay tribute to my intensive care colleagues who not only have been treating patients at their sickest but also overseeing the work of nurses like myself who have just stepped intotheir departments.“It is incredibly challenging, skilful work. I’ve had to learn new skills, in an intense environment and you can be wearing PPE all night, which is hard. “I have looked after some patients who are awake and on oxygen, and we are trying to keep them off the ventilators.  “It is scary for them as they are struggling to breathe, and it’s emotionally draining for the nurses having to care for them and keep in touch with their families. I did a sht on another ward last week where people recovering from the virus were being treated. “It was so rewarding to see how our work has helped them to get better.” Zoe Carciente AE nurse  Zoe is one of the thousands of nurses who have joined the profession on the front line of the NHS, weeks before properly qualying. But in the AE department of her local North West Lon­­don hospital, -year-old Zoe is a full team member. She says: “My le changed so rapidly but nursing is what I want to do and I’m not one to panic, so just threw myself into the job.  For students like myself, this is what we came into it for.” The mother of two, who retrained as a nurse after her children became more independent, says that nursing is in her blood. “My mother used to work as an ITU nurse and it was just something I wanted to do myself. “It has been a daunting time but the staff have been so hugely supportive of us.” Katie Kearns Ward Sister Katie, , is in charge of the first ward atthe Royal Marsden Hospital in London to treat Covid- patients.Katie, who has been nursing for eight years, says: “It was daunting at first. The main thing was that my staff were scared and I wanted to reassure them that they would be protected by the hospital, the Trust and the NHS.  I have three newly qualied nurses so I was very aware that they were junior in their careers. “But sometimes they have really been the ­backbone and they have been incredible. “I have always made sure that my staff are looking after themselves as well. “It is dficult when patients get very sick.  For those who have been very poorly and may not live, we have in exceptional cases let a family member come and say their goodbyes and leave.” Katie appreciates the public support, saying: “It really makes you proud of what you do. I love going past people’s houses and seeing the pictures that children have drawn in the windows.” Beth Kimber Head of infection prevention  Beth, , works for Norfolk Community Health and Care NHS Trust and has been instrumental in setting up the area’s ­swabbing and testing regime. She and colleagues have also been testing in care homes. She says: “The residents are high risk but they aren’t scared.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton teams up royal","story":"NewsKate Middleton teams up with Royal Familys secret weapon as Queen asks them to step upWith the Queen self-isolating and Meghan Markle and Prince Harry quitting, other members of the Royal Family have been asked to step up to official duties to help William and Kate Middleton during the coronavirus pandemicShareCommentsByRussell MyersZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  MAY NewsKate and Sophie are very close \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The distressing moment, which took place on Blackwell Trail in Derbyshire, saw the man become verbally abusive. The girlaposs mum, Michelle Prost, says her daughter was left traumatised by the incident, which she shared on social media yesterday. As the clip begins, Michelleaposs daughter can be seen riding her bike along the trail. She begins to approach the couple who are walking their dog and a manaposs voice shouts: Excuse me. The little girl begins ringing her bell as she approaches the dog walkers who make no attempt to move.  As she gets closer they still do not allow her space, and she begins wobbling. She tries to squeeze through but as neither adult allows her past she becomes sandwiched between them before toppling off her bike. The man shouts angrily I said excuse me several times as the young girl lies sprawled on the floor. The adults then begin having a heated discussion with the man explaining the girl is only six years old.  The little girl then bursts into tears, wailing Daddy as the couple walk away. Just as he is about to leave, the man is seen aggressively kicking the little girlaposs bike before walking away. An outraged Michelle took to social media to expose the manaposs behaviour. She posted the video with the caption: So this couple purposely ignore my  year old daughter ringing her bell and saying excuse me.  She starts screaming and wobbling in panic. The man turns and looks at my daughter, then the couple look at each other but continue to ignore her on purpose. She then rides into them in panic.

Belly Mujinga, , who had suffered long-term respiratory problems, died in hospital on April  –  days after the alleged assault at London’s Victoria Station. The mother-of-one and an unnamed colleague who was with her at the time were spat on, and both went on to contract Covid-. Their attacker, who has not been identied, allegedly told his victims that he had the virus. Although the other woman recovered, Belly’s condition deteriorated after she started to feel ill. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here She died just three days after being admitted to an intensive care ward and put on a ventilator. Her husband Lusamba, , and their daughter Ingrid, , never got to say goodbye. Ingrid had one last video call from her mum in her bed at Barnet Hospital before she became too sick to talk. Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman said today: It’s a tragic and appalling case, we specically strengthened the rules and the CPS published their own guidance to ensure people are protected from this sort of behaviour. Itaposs a really shocking incident and our thoughts are with the victim and their family.” Last night, Lusamba said Belly had asked for a back office job when the threat of Covid- became apparent in early March. But he alleges that her employer Thameslink, which runs services through the capital, insisted that she should continue dealing with customers face to face, before social-distancing rules had been installed. Lusamba, of Hendon, North London, said his we had made her bosses aware of her health issues following an operation three years ago. Belly was diagnosed with the lung condition sarcoidosis, which causes shortness of breath and a persistent dry cough. “My daughter Ingrid just does not understand what has happened, how we can never be together again” the former warehouse worker said.  “It’s terrible to lose the person you love so quickly. “We are sure she got the virus from the man who spat on her, and it could have been so easily avoided. “He just shouted at them, ‘What are you doing here ’ and then spat over them deliberately. Belly was so upset and so scared.  “Our doctor had told us that she should keep away from people from three months because she was at risk. It was too dangerous, he told us. “After this happened he called the train company, but by then it was too late, she had already been infected.” Belly and Lusama came to Britain from the Democratic Republic of Congo as political refugees seeking refuge after facing persecution in their birth country. Both had worked hard to get a better le for themselves and their daughter. Belly was a member of the TSSA transport workers’ union, which has reported the alleged attack to the Railways Inspectorate, the safety arm of the Office for Road and Rail , for investigation. It believes the £, compensation which will be paid to relatives of health and care workers who die as a result of the pandemic should be extended to front-line transport staff too. General secretary Manuel Cortes said parent company GTR did not treat the assault seriously enough. “Sadly, Belly’s is just one of many family tragedies where children have had their parents taken away from them,” he said. “However, there are serious questions about her death, it wasn’t inevitable. “As a vulnerable person in the ‘at risk’ category and her condition known to her employer, there are questions about why GTR didn’t stand her down from front line duties early on in this pandemic.” Angie Doll, Managing Director of Southern Railway and Gatwick Express said: “We are devastated that our dedicated colleague Belly has passed away and our deepest sympathies are with her family with whom we have been in touch with through this very dficult time.

Yet we have also never been more connected – to our neighbours, our families, and to all those experiencing the coronavirus across the world. The virus has turned our lives upside down. But it has also shown how our country can pull together. Want to help you build on this on this, launching an exciting, new, ground-breaking project, Britain Connects – connecting people across the UK with dferent views for a virtual chat. Our readers up and down the country are overcoming isolation by connecting with people they wouldnapost usually meet for an online chat. Do you want to join them  What is it  The aim is to speak to someone you might not usually meet, to find out what they are like and explore what our nation has in common, whatever our political or other dferences. We hope that by connecting people as we reach peak isolation during the coronavirus crisis, we can help bring the country together. With your help, this could be a unique moment of connection – and a positive and meaningful way of marking a one-off moment in global history and all of our lives. How does it work  To take part, all you need to do is fill in this questionnaire here. We’ll do the rest… We will match people across age, across geography, across le experience and across political lines. Whoever we are, we all facing this together. We’ll match you with someone who has dferent views and set up a video meeting on the weekend - May.  What better way to spend the late May bank holiday than by staying in, saving lives, protecting the NHS – and connecting with someone new  Just fill out the survey to get started. What can I hope to get out of it  Last year, the Daily Mirror teamed up with political rivals theand many of Reach PLC’s regional titles to bring you Britain Talks, which asked people to cross the Brexit ide for a cup of tea and a chat. This year, we’re teaming up again to ask people with dferent experiences of le during the coronavirus to meet up using the technologies keeping many of us in touch with our family and friends. We are also partnering with the Behavioural Insights Team, who helped us build Britain Connects and are studying our project for a paper later this year.“The coronavirus crisis has created a shared experience without precedent for all of us,” they say. “This unique situation also means that while we adjust to the pandemic there is an opportunity to connect and bring people closer together as never before.

She was caught on camera as she ran amok in her red SUV, running over multiple graves. Amanda Hill, whose grandfather Robert Eugene Marsh and his we Ruth are among those buried in the cemetery, said the driver took no notice of relatives who shouted and begged her to stop. Her mother resorted to trying to physically defend the grave of her grandfather, who served during the war as a First Lieutenant in the Air Force carrying out bombing raids in Germany, by standing in front of it. She attempted to reason with the woman and ask her to stop, but was forced out of the way as the van drove towards her. aposI felt bad for the families whose loved onesapos graves were run over, Ms Hill said.

Speaking about the Cadbury Dairy Milk Moro Block, he said: These are a must.  He added: The Dairy Milk tastes better quality than our UK version, richer and more like it used to back in the day. The pockets of caramel are lovely and again tastes better than UK Cadbury caramel. The chocolate malt filling gives a rich malty flavour, it’s very chocolatey but with a distinct malted edge. All together it’s delicious! And went on to say that even though he loves mint chocolate, it can be hard to get the combinations right, revealing that the Cadbury Dairy Milk Crispy Mint Creme was not his favourite out of the new two. He said: Here, there’s the creamy Dairy Milk coating a sweet but strong mint flavour creme. Think mint chip ice cream. The crunchy pieces add some nice texture and overall it’s very sweet and minty. I’m not sure this is my favourite so far - I preferred the Moro block. Butyou’re a mint lover this is one you’ll surely enjoy!

The WHO said no-one is safe until everyone is safe - and said it is dangerous to think that countries can magically reach herd immunity. Although the UK government has denied adopting this approach in the early days of the pandemic, many experts believe this was the initial goal. Sweden has refused to introduce a full lockdown, and scientists there are optimistic that a large proportion of the population will develop antibodies. The term aposherd immunityapos describes how a population is protected from a diseaseenough people develop immunity through antibodies created by the illness or a vaccination. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here   Dr Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHOaposs health emergencies programme, told a press briefing in Geneva that it is not a feasible policy. He said: Humans are not herds, and, as such, the concept of herd immunity is generally reserved for calculating how many people will need to be vaccinated and the population in order to generate that effect. This is a serious disease, this is public enemy number one, we have been saying it over and over and over and over again.  He said no one is safe until everyone is safe, adding: So I do think this idea that aposmaybe countries who had lax measures and havenapost done anything will all of a sudden magically reach some herd immunity, and so whatwe lose a few old people along the way apos - this is a really dangerous, dangerous calculation. Dr Ryan continued: Responsible member states will look at all their population - they value every member of society and they try to do everything possible to protect health while at the same time, obviously, protecting society and protecting the economy and other things.

I think that’s why they took to him right away.“I am delighted for him, he’s still very fit and he’ll be looking to add to the games he has played for this football club.“I know he still believes there is a lot more football in Paul McGowan and I think he’s had another excellent season.”The duo arrived at Dens as players in the summer of  and became fast friends, driving up to Dundee from Glasgow every day.Now McGowan’s boss, McPake admits their relationship has changed somewhat from the days when he’d be on the receiving end of a regular verbal volley on the park.“If there were three people around him then he would still take the ball,” McPake added.“That’s brave –people talk about centre-backs being brave because they’ll put their head where it hurts but Paul McGowan is brave because he’ll take the ball in tight spaces and work something.“He very rarely loses the ball, gets you fouls and there is a respect from other teams to him. I’ve found that as a manager, the amount of times I heard ‘McGowan’s a good player’ from other managers last season.“He was great to play with, he would always take it – he could be a pain when you didn’t give him it and the game is going on up the pitch but he’s still standing trying to argue with you!“That’s Gowser. But there’s more than a screamer or a shouter – he encourages people, he helps people out and he’s honest. He’s the first to put his hand up when he believes he’s done something wrong and that’s gone in the modern game. He sets such high standards.“He’s a voice in the dressing-room as well. I’ve played with him but it’s a completely dferent relationship now.#I was his team-mate and his mate but now we don’t see much of each other apart from on the training ground. The dynamics have changed but I know exactly what I’ll get from him whenever he’s on the pitch.“There have been a few times when I’ve thought ‘I’m glad I’ve got Paul McGowan’. Evenhe’s not played you might think there will be a problem, not playing against United or Aberdeen, but he just accepts it and goes and trains.“There’s no sulking and is great to work with. He was great to play with because he’s such a quality footballer and I’m glad I have him at my disposal as a manager. He’s a leader for our club.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53619993-3-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53619993-3-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53619993-3-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53619993-3-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"the feelgood feed stories to lift your day","story":"Things are tough right now — but the power of community has never been more important or more obvious.In every walk of le, people are coming together to ensure that no one is left to fight coronavirus alone.

and he established a striking rapport with his Aberdeen audience when he starred alongside Phill Jupitus at a festival in February.He said: “It was lovely to visit the Music Halland see it in such fine fettle.#The lockdown is a huge blow, of course, but venues such as the Music Hall need to be preserved, praised and cherished.#I think it is a huge asset to Aberdeen.”He is one of the most famous figures in the history of global science.And the pioneering achievements of James Clerk Maxwell laid the groundwork for everything from Einstein’s theory of relativity to the creation of modern electronics.But the restlessly energetic Scot was also a driving force in the expansion and refurbishment of the Music Hall during his time as a professor in the Granite City.As a member of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, he was determined to persuade them to stage its annual meeting in the north-east.So he was thrilled when it was agreed that the  convention would be held in Aberdeen.But there was a glitch: the city # which only had a population of , in these days # had no venue which was suitable for such a conference and the existing County Assembly Rooms were too small to accommodate such a large event.Nonetheless, this didn’t deter the protagonist of author Brian Clegg’s work, #Professor Maxwell’s Duplicitous Demon#, who was instrumental in Aberdeen rising to the challenge of upgrading the auditorium and making sure that it was worthy of hosting major occasions beyond occasional talks and recitals.Mr Clegg said: “With Maxwell among its shareholders, the Music Hall Company set to work on the rapid construction of a spacious venue in Union Street.“The imposing -foot-high internal space was capable of seating , people and is still a major feature of the cityscape today.“And the British Association of Science meeting, which was opened by Prince Albert, was a huge success.”However, there was a curious backdrop to the story, with the Music Hall Company continuing to send idends from its proceeds to Maxwell at the long-defunct Marischal College through to the early s, long after his death in .#Watching from the wings at the Music Hall in Aberdeen is one of my earliest memories.#I grew up backstage and, to this day, the excitement I feel whenever I hear the buzz of an audience taking their seats, the sense of anticipation, the lights going down and the spotlight going on is magical.#For me, the Music Hall has so many happy memories for our family. #My father, Calum, won the Mod Gold Medal in  in this wonderful jewel of a concert hall, which has a brilliant acoustic # especially for singers, acoustic bands and orchestras. #You can hear the quietest note ringing out right to the back row of the balcony.#Winning the gold medal was the catalyst for my father’s career, as he went on to compete in the World Ballad Championship in Moscow in  beating  competitors! #That was pretty amazing and he was presented with another gold medal by President Khrushchev at The Bolshoi #

I’d hit a few in training and missed and hit a few as a boy and missed so I was never confident of scoring.“I can take the credit for hitting the winning penalty, but the real credit goes to the guys that kept their cool in sudden death and to Theo Snelders.“Alex, Stewart, David and Graham all scored to keep us in the shoot-out then Theo makes a wonderful save from Anton Rogan and that was the winner really.“It gave me the confidence going forward knowing I could win the cup rather than needing to score to keep us in the shoot-out.“I was in a fortunate situation because evenI hadn’t scored we’d still have had a chance and that was down to the guys before me and Theo’s great save.“Despite not being confident I was a lot more positive because of Theo’s save. If I’d had to score to stop us losing it might have been a dferent story because that’s a dferent kind of pressure.”Alex Smith and Jocky Scott’s side also won the League Cup that season. Irvine came on as a sub in the final win over Rangers, but an injury to Willie Miller gave him his chance in the Scottish Cup final.Miller played with Irvine in the final Premier Division game of the season – a - win over Celtic at Parkhead – but on the way back from that game co-manager Smith assured Irvine he would start the final in central defence alongside McLeish.Aberdeen#s route to  Scottish Cup # the last time the Dons lted the national trophy\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp sport football aberdeen-fc donsnews aberdeens-route-to--scottish-cup-the-last-time-the-dons-lted-the-national-trophy embed # secretEfpvvWdi\" data-secret\"EfpvvWdi\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"He said: “Willie would always have played ahead of myselfit had been a level playing field.“But at that time Willie was getting towards the end of his career and was trying to come back from injury.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

The beauty and calm of the island made a lasting impression on me.#The monuments of Kilmartin Glen are also at the very heart of the book’s major themes, including kingship and the sacredness of landscape.#And it was at Dunadd that Aidan would have seen the kings of Dál RiataPortals to this other-world still survive, suggested by mountains, forgotten ruins, holy wells and standing stones, crosses and caves, said Mr Connell.Born in Newcastle, he now lives in Cumbria, England, with his partner and their daughter.He previously worked for titles including The Edinburgh Evening News, with bylines in The Scotsman and Scotland on Sunday.The book has been published by Culture and Democracy Press and is available to purchase online through Amazon for £."},{"url":null,"title":"national theatre announces new digital programming","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe National Theatre has announced the next two productions to be streamed live on YouTube every Thursday at pm.The screenings are part of National Theatre at Home the new initiative to bring content to the public accessed from their homes during coronavirus.Productions announced today include the NT Live broadcast of Danny Boyle’s production of Frankenstein filmed at the National Theatre in , which sees Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller alternating the roles of Victor Frankenstein and his creation.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

There are opportunities to continue doing some of the activities we are doing remotely when weto normal.She is one of several staff members who have had to change the way they give support over the past weeks but it still focuses on many of the same issues. They provide help with filling out job and college applications, and provide young people with emotional support and tutoring. The response has also generally been very positive, with staff members reporting engagement levels of up to  per cent from their clients.Natasha McInninie, transitions service co-ordinator, said: ldquoI am surprised by how resilient young people are. I thought we would lose a lot of young people through this situation.

The residential units are shown to be laid out in such a way that adheres to the normally accepted privacy and amenity criteria on overlooking and overshadowing, whilst affording the future occupants of the residential units an appropriate level of privacy and residential amenity.Access to the new development would come from Fall Avenue and James Kirk Way.A design and access statement included within the planning application notes meetings had taken place with ious local authority departments in a bid to address ious design requirements.It concludes: ldquoOverall, it is considered that the final design creates a well-considered, proportionate design that responds to the site constraints and the nearby area to create a positive design solution.ldquoThe result is a development that will make a positive contribution socially, economically and aesthetically to the area and enhance the amenity of existing and future residents within this area.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council stressed they ldquowelcomed comments from community councils.She said: ldquoIn this case, we consulted the community council back in December, and they submitted a response detailing a number of concerns.ldquoThese included concerns over house type and layout, increased vehicle movement and parking space provision.ldquoWhilst we understand that consultees may be frustrated when planning authorities do not always agree with their comments, we must balance these comments against the other material considerations of each case.ldquoIn the case of the Hallhill application, our conclusion was that, subject to the imposition of conditions, the proposed development was acceptable.Thank you for reading this story.

This year the figure fell to less than  per cent.The council also refuses to allow children whose parents opt to keep them home and fund the nursery place themselves to remain in school nurseries.Parents who decide to pay for an additional year of nursery themselves to keep their children out for a year face bills of up to pound, and a hunt for alternative child care places.Another mum who was refused funding said she had initially been supported in her view that her child was too immature to start school by her nursery.But they withdrew that support after pressure from the councilrsquos education department, she said.ldquoThey were told that they couldnrsquot support us because we didnrsquot meet the council policy criteria and withdrew their support, she explained.ldquoOur views meant nothing and the impact on our child meant nothing.And other parents expressed fears that their children were being robbed of nursery experience because they have been in lockdown for some of the vital months they would have had and would have no transition into school.One mum said: Children who start school at -years-old already receive a year less nursery time than those who are older, that has been reduced further by the closure of nurseries.ldquoHow can we ask these young children to go from months at home with their family to suddenly starting primary one with no transition A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: ldquoconfirmed they have now agreed to approve all deferral requests for the year ahead.They said: ldquoAs a result of the ongoing closure of schools and nurseries, we have been reviewing applications for deferred entry to P, ahead of session  . Due to the current situation, applications for deferred entry and a further funded year have now been approved. Following the full, national implementation of the expansion of early learning and childcare, we will carry out a review of our wider policy on deferred entry.Thank you for reading this story.

Almost everyone abides by the coronavirus code, which carries an echo of the police speed awareness course I was once obliged to attend. ldquoOnly a fool ignores the two second rule,\" went the jingle for keeping your distance from the vehicle in front. Breaking the new rules could be even more hazardous.Everyone extols the virtues of regular walking, and to judge by peoplersquos faces and mood, itrsquos doing us good. Therersquos nothing like having your liberty taken to encourage you to get outdoors while you can. A favourite walk follows an old drove road, along which herders would drive their beasts to market, either locally or in the north of England. Wide, and partially cobbled, this route allows you to get into a stride, while scanning trees and sky, or field upon field of horses and their winter foals.A drove road like this could be as old as the village, or even older. Hoolet was officially granted permission to hold a market in the early s, so itrsquos possible that from miles around people traded their animals to and from here along tracks such as this. One of the commonest books yoursquoll find in second-hand book shops is A R B Haldanersquos The Drove Roads of Scotland.Regrettably I have lost my fatherrsquos copy, but have a sellotaped edition of my husbandrsquos. First published in , it looks off-puttingly dry and yet it offers a riveting insight into a way of le so long gone as to feel mythical. By way of research, Haldane spoke to shepherds, farmers, crofters and factors to mine them for local knowledge. The result is a testament to the part livestock and their keepers have played in our history.A colourful passage from a Victorian onlooker describes a livestock ldquotryst at Stenhousemuir, where around , sheep and tens of thousands of cattle were gathered. He writes of the tar pots used to mark sold beasts, the cacophony of cattle dealers, drovers, pedlars, gamblers, ballad singers and beggars, and of servants ldquorunning about shouting to the cattle, keeping them together in their particular lots and ever and anon cudgels are at work upon the horns and rumps of the restless animals that attempt to wander in search of grass or water. Such a welter of beasts recalls the great buffalo herds in the American mid-west, and the drama, and danger, of keeping them under control.Did such a multitude of hooves ever thunder past the village  The old track is so tranquil, despite the orchestration of birds, itrsquos hard to imagine its former use. But I find that is the case with almost everything about country le. Books, newspapers and documentaries constantly inform us about tempting rural walks we can take for our health and pleasure, and walking during lockdown has enjoyed a resurgence in the same way as biking. Yet well into the th century people from a hamlet like ours, and all across the country, walked for miles every day: not as a hobby or to keep fit, but because it was their only means of transport.The picturesque village of Denholm, not far away, is the birthplace of the famous linguist John Leyden. As a young man he once walked  miles in a day, just to record the final verses of a song to add to Sir Walter Scottrsquos compendium of border ballads. The shepherd James Hogg would think nothing of crossing the hills of an evening from the Ettrick valley to Tibbie Shielsrsquo Inn by St Maryrsquos Loch, to carouse with friends. Itrsquos a round trip of over  miles. When his household needed provisions from Selkirk, the nearest town, that would entail another -mile jaunt. Presumably a mule or pony was used for such a distance  But even for the four-legged, that is quite a schlepp.Another legendary walker was Thomas de Quincey, a forerunner of the redoubtable Captain Tom Moore. In the s he planned to cure himself of his ldquoopium misery by walking himself fit, but at this precise moment his legs failed him. His doctorrsquos warnings were dire and, fearing thathe didnrsquot cure himself he would be disabled for the rest of his le, he took to the garden of his cottage near Lasswade. Measuring its perimeter, he estimated  laps came to a mile. Starting out cautiously, he gradually grew stronger. Soon he was doing  or  miles a day until, he wrote, ldquoI had within ninety days walked  miles\". While he lived here, his medical student lodger trudged seven miles to Edinburgh University and back every day, so commonplace an occurrence it was barely worth remarking on.Itrsquos easy to look back on the great distances country folk covered with pity as well as awe, but as any serious walker knows, few things are more enjoyable ndash in decent weather ndash than clocking up the miles. There are moments when you feel like a piece of machinery, the cogs and wheels working in unison. Itrsquos also a failsafe way of clearing the mind, and finding fresh inspiration. Whenever my husband is stuck for the next sentence, he heads out. The top of every article or chapter he writes should record the tally of miles walked between first word and last.Itrsquos no wonder so many writers have been walkers. Not all were obliged to tramp the hills and roadside every day but many, like Robert Louis Stevenson, recognised the therapeutic benefits. He didnrsquot want to scale the heights, or keep to a strict and demanding schedule. A steady pace was his aim because, ldquoonce you have fallen into an equable stride, it requires no conscious thought from you to keep it up, yet it prevents you from thinking earnestly of anything ..."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-enjoy-cairngorms-comfort-armchair","story":"The hotels, bars and restaurants are quiet, the visitors are at home.

they may be.As well as providing Scots with a massive puzzle to solve, the collection of images offers a rare insight into what le was like throughout Scotland in years not that long gone by, with pub interiors, fashion trends and interior design choices also captured.One of the most striking elements of the outdoor photographs is the lack of vehicles travelling on Scottish roads, while others capture everyday elements of le which were familiar at the time but are now long gone ndash such as one image showing firemen dressed in their yellow waterproofs, shoppers queuing outside their local fishmonger, and children playing in the street on their Chopper bikes.Lesley Ferguson, head of archives at HES, said: ldquoPeople will find this collection really engaging. Sometimes history can be too far away, whereas this is history that people will remember.ldquoSome show buildings and others are just street scenes taken at a time when there were far fewer cars on the road.ldquoUnfortunately, we donrsquot know where some of these historic photographs were taken and thatrsquos why we are asking for the publicrsquos help.While the images have been digitised and uploaded to Canmore, the online catalogue of HES archives, it was felt it would be too time-consuming for HES staff to st through the , unidentied images in an effort to find their location.Instead itrsquos hoped that visitors to the Canmore website will come to the rescue and email details of locations and buildings to HES staff. The images will be alternated regularly to allow more photographs to be catalogued.The unidentied images are among around , plastic photographic negatives and some printed photographs contained within the HES Scottish Development Department collection, most of which contain information regarding the location where they were taken.Some relate to the development of Scotlandrsquos New Towns, while others show buildings in a state of disrepair and may be among the last photographs prior to the buildings being lost forever.Last year alone, over , items from the HES archives were digitised, among them prints relating to signicant archaeological digs and images of excavations at historic sites such as Skara Brae in Orkney and Edinburgh Castle.They included approximately , prints digitised from personal research and work by prominent archaeologists such as Dr Euan Mackie, Roger Mercer and Vere Gordon Childe, with the oldest image dating from around .Mackiersquos collection comprises field notes, photographs, drawings and ious research material collected during investigations of threatened sites including East Wemyss Caves and the Greenland, Auchentorlie prehistoric rock sculptures.Much of the collection derives from his s excavation and survey of brochs and duns, notably Dun Mor Vaul in Tiree, Dun Lagaidh, and Dun an Ruigh Ruadh in Lochbroom.Over one million archives documenting Scotlandrsquos archaeological sites, buildings, industry and maritime heritage are currently available on Canmore.Ferguson added: ldquoThese archives give a unique perspective on civic planning in the th century including the development and growth of Scotlandrsquos New Towns, while the images of excavations showcase the sites that helped archaeologists unlock the secrets of Scotlandrsquos past ndash from the Neolithic to the Middle Ages.ldquoBy digitising our archives, wersquore able to make them available to even more people.

The festival has been cancelled and cultural gatherings across the country have been put on hold or postponed.It goes without saying that in these times our priority is the health and safety of our families, our loved ones ndash whether thatrsquos hugs with grandchildren, seeing friends or enjoying shared experiences such as the Spirit of Speyside Festival which should have been held last week. However, what I have witnessed emerging is hope, resilience and a strong Scottish can-do attitude. In the whisky industry, in particular, within days of lockdown being announced, distilleries rallied together to manufacture large quantities of vitally important hand sanitiser.Itrsquos a true testament to our Scottish fighting spirit that we will not take this lying down. We adapt and move forward as best we can. Irsquom extremely proud of the Speyside community and our wider Spirit of Speyside Festival family across the world for keeping the spirit of the festival alive.Whisky and tourism are pivotal sectors to the Scottish economy. Three out of every five tourists come to Speyside for whisky tourism. In fact, the Spirit of Speyside Festival welcomed visitors from  dferent countries to its th anniversary event last year. The Spirit of Speyside Whisky Festival has become an iconic event on the international whisky calendar, appealing to both the whisky curious and connoisseurs in a region that has become one of the fastest-growing tourist destinations in the UK.As well as being home to the highest concentration of distilleries of all whisky regions in the world, Speyside also produces the largest volume of whisky, as well as an increasingly wide range of spirits ndash we are now home to  dferent gin companies.This is why we introduced our Speyside Gin Festival in June, to create a new weekend for both locals and visitors to enjoy, then we celebrate all our great Speyside whisky companies and local gin and craft beer companies at our Distilled Festival, all under one roof in Elgin, normally at the end of August.This yearrsquos Gin Festival has sadly been cancelled and a decision is yet to be made about Distilled. However, based on current guidance, we feel itrsquos unlikely it will go ahead.But the appetite for whisky is there and it will remain. I am confident our economy will be rebuilt and we will work hard to do this together. According to VisitScotland, the Spirit of Speyside Festival welcomed visitors from  dferent countries to its th anniversary festival last year. This is a sector that is worth pound million to the regionrsquos economy. When we emerge from the other side of the pandemic Irsquom certain these figures will only increase.International travel is sure to take a downturn in the short term, while people look for local and regional travel opportunities on their doorstep. Domestic travel is set to be the first to bounce back when restrictions are eased, and I canrsquot wait to welcome tourists from all over the UK to beautul Speyside.Our Team Speyside approach to tourism will pull us through these tough times in our part of the world, of that I have no doubt. Our whisky distilleries will reopen, glasses will be raised to good health, and visitors from across the world will once again immerse themselves in Malt Whisky Country. Never will the term ldquoslaacuteinte mhaith hold more weight than it will when this is all over.

But it is a plan that should give the people of the United Kingdom hope. Hope that we can rebuild hope that we can save lives hope that we can safeguard livelihoods.ldquoIt will require much from us all: that we remain alert that we care for those at most risk that we pull together as a United Kingdom. We will continue to work with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to ensure these outcomes for everybody, wherever they live in the UK.The Prime Minister says the plan seeks to ldquo le to as close to normal as possible, for as many people as possible, as fast and fairly as possible, in a way that is safe and continues to protect our NHS.He adds: ldquoThis is one of the biggest international challenges faced in a generation. But our great country has faced and overcome huge trials before. Our response to these unprecedented and unpredictable challenges must be similarly ambitious, selfless and creative.The document reveals consideration is being given to allow people south of the border to expand their household group to include one other household \"in the same exclusive group,\" which could be based on the New Zealand model of household \"bubbles\". Such a move would allow more social contact and support some families ing to work by, for example, allowing two households to share childcare.People are told they may drive to outdoor open spaces irrespective of distance, so long as they respect social distancing guidance while they are there because this does not involve contact with people outside their own household.The guidance then notes: ldquoWhen travelling to outdoor spaces, it is important that people respect the rules in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and do not travel to dferent parts of the UK where it would be inconsistent with guidance or regulations issued by the relevant devolved administration.Last week, a family from London were caught on the M near Carlisle attempting an -mile round trip from London to Motherwell for a three-day lockdown holiday.From this week in England and Wales, people will be able to take part in more leisure activities outdoors, provided at all times they follow the social distancing rules.Under phase one, these will include having picnics, sunbathing, swimming in lakes and in the sea, playing golf and tennis. Consequently, golf courses, tennis and basketball courts will all be able to reopen from Wednesday.Playgrounds, outdoor gyms and \"ticketed outdoor leisure venues\" - where there is a higher risk of close contact - remain off-limits, however.The reopening of such leisure facilities may only be \"fully possible signicantly later\" depending on the reduction in infections, adds the guidance.Downing Street confirmed that, under the new lockdown rules for south of the border, an inidual could meet with one person who was not from their household in an outdoor setting such as a park, provided the two-metre distance rule were observed.Boris Johnsonrsquos spokesman explained: \"You could go to the park with your household and, whereas at the moment you would have to be exercising, you can do that for leisure.\"So, you could sit down with members of your family or those of you in the same household, you could sunbathe or have a picnic or whatever. Thats one thing.\"Alternatively,just you went out, you could meet one other person not from your household in the park and, provided they stay two metres away from you, you can sit down alongside one another and chat, sunbathe, do whatever.\"What you cant do is combine those two things. You cant go out with your household, adding one other person to it,\" he added.Phase two from June could see the phased reopening of nurseries and primary schools as well as non-essential shops, the staging of sports events like football matches behind closed doors and the reopening of some public transport.Phase three, which would occur no earlier than July , could see hairdressers reopen as well as some pubs, hotels, places of worship and cinemas, so long as social distancing rules can be applied.Asked about the warning from Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister, that even modest changes could have the potential to risk lives, Professor Chris Whitty, Englandrsquos Chief Medical Officer, said the expert group SAGE was recommending the slight easing because there was a ldquolittle bit of room for manoeuvre given the number of infected cases was falling and the infection rate was already below one.\"We are confident the risk of being outdoors, in terms of meeting people, provided it is with social distancing, is signicantly lower than that of indoors.\"We are confident these quite small changes will not have a material effect, on their own, provided people stick to the social distancing and the rules that are there, on increasing the R beyond where we are at the moment.\"He added: \"We are not claiming there are no risks in this but what we think is that they are very small and proportionate to the advantage of overall wellbeing, exercise leading to good health and sustainability.\"The Government document explains how ministers and officials are examining how to enable people to gather in ldquoslightly larger groups to better facilitate small weddings.It goes on: \"Over the coming weeks, the Government will engage on the nature and timing of the measures in this step in order to consider the widest possible array of views on how best to balance the health, economic and social effects.\"Among the new recommended measures is the wearing of face-coverings.It explains that because of increased mobility as more peopleto work the Government is now advising that people should ldquoaim to wear a face-covering in enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible and they come into contact with others that they do not normally meet, for example on public transport or in some shops.The document points out how face-coverings are not intended to help the wearer but protect against any inadvertent transmission of the disease to others.ldquoA face covering is not the same as a facemask such as the surgical masks or respirators used as part of personal protective equipment by healthcare and other workers. These supplies must continue to be reserved for those who need it. Face-coverings should not be used by children under the age of two, or those who may find it dficult to manage them correctly, for example primary age children unassisted, or those with respiratory conditions. It is important to use face-coverings properly and wash your hands before putting them on and taking them off.Prof Whitty pointed out how there had been scientic debate across many countries on the efficacy of face-coverings and, on balance, SAGE decided there was evidence of a ldquomodest effect in a person, who had the virus without knowing it for two to three days, being able to protect someone . He pointed out the scientic evidence was not strong enough to make the wearing of masks compulsory. He also stressed wearing face-coverings was not an alternative to social distancing.Last month, the Scottish Government recommended face-coverings in restricted areas but at the time the UK Government did not. However, its experts now believe that wearing them can produce a small but positive benefit, particularly in restricting the transmission from an infected person, who might not be showing signs of having the disease."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10306315.jpg?type=article-full","title":"coronavirus-germany-infection-rate-continues-rise-lockdown-eases","story":"Latest figuresfrom the Robert Koch Instituteshowthat the coronavirus reproduction rate in Germany is now ., up from . the day before and . on Friday.Mondays figure meansthat every patient is infecting at least one other.

If it exceeds one, the virus could rapidly take off again.That is why the Scottish Government is exercising such care and caution.We announced one change to the rules yesterday. If you want to exercise outdoors more than once a day, you can now do so.But otherwise we are asking you to stick with lockdown for a bit longer - so that we can consolidate our progress, not jeopardise it.Except for essential work that canrsquot be done at home, going out for food and medicine, or for exercise - please continue to stay at home.When you do go outside, please stay two metres from other people - and donrsquot meet up with people from other households.Please wear a face coveringyou are in a shop or on public transport. And wash your hands thoroughly and regularly.These measures are essential for now. But we know they cause harm of their own, so we will not keep them in place for longer than necessary.As the infection rate continues to fall, we will gradually relax the restrictions.And we are already making preparations for that.We are working with businesses to produce guidance on safe workplaces.We are working on the changes needed on public transport.And we are talking to teachers and parents about how and when schools can safely .We are doing all of that carefully because it is vital that when we do ask you toto work or to school, you have clarity about what we are asking you to do and also confidence that it is safe.We are also expanding our ability to test people for COVID-, and trace those they have been in contact with. That will be important to control new outbreaks.On all of this, I will keep you informed every step of the way.I want to make sure that as we take each step on the path to recovery, the ground beneath us is as solid as possible. But I will not keep these restrictions in place longer than necessary.As First Minister, I know the impact this has on all of you. And as a citizen, I miss my family too.But I wonrsquot risk unnecessary deaths by acting rashly or prematurely.So I am asking you please, for the moment, to continue to do what you have been doing so responsibly.I also want to say a special thank you to children. Not being at school, or seeing your friends, or hugging your grandparents is really tough.But you have handled it brilliantly. Irsquom so proud of all of you.For all of us, I know itrsquos getting harder but letrsquos keep supporting each other even as we stay apart.Letrsquos remember what matters most - health, family, community.Staying at home now is an expression of love, kindness and solidarity.

But based on the narrow Stay at Home slogan, talking to someone in your street from a distance, sunbathing, sitting on a park bench, travelling to a second home or simply going for a drive has turned conscientious citizens into criminals.Now we find out that even the two-metre rule is not actually accurate. Depending upon who you listen to itrsquos between a metre and a metre and a half, which may not mean much to us as iniduals but for institutions, offices, pubs and restaurants trying to work out how to operate, it means quite a lot.Despite the talk of expertise and \"the science\", there is not only a mindless simplicity to the Stay at Home slogan but also a puritanical undertone. Scotlandrsquos National Clinical Director Jason Leitch has even managed to start a row by suggesting golf courses should stay closed because it wouldnrsquot be fair on single parents: allowing some groups to enjoy themselves while others remain stuck in their homes would apparently send out the wrong message.And as we know, the little people need a clear message ndash eventhere is no science to back it up and it makes no sense.The Stay at Home approach is wrong.

There were too many people in the carriage and social distancing was impossible to maintain,\" added Mr McCarthy.Transport operators in England are being urged to rearrange, remove or limit seating \"to try and ensure social distancing is observed\".This could include blocking off seats in close proximity to others and removing face-to-face seating.Single users of black cabs and minicabs are being advised to sit in the back left-hand seat of taxis.All transport operators have been issued guidance on ensuring stations and services are regularly cleaned.Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, who will make a Commons statement on the guidance this afternoon, said: \"Transport operators and staff have been working hard to ensure that people who need to get to work are able to do so, including crucial NHS workers and all those on the front line of the fight against the virus.\"Alongside the cycling and walking revolution we are launching and clear guidance to passengers and operators published today, we can all play our part by following the advice and reducing pressure on public transport.\"If we take these steps, all those who need to use public transport should feel confident that they can do so safely with the space to maintain social distancing as far as possible,\" he added.Passengers south of the border are being advised to \"avoid using public transport where possible\" and should \"instead try to walk, cycle or drive\".People who do travel should be \"thinking carefully about the times, routes and ways you travel\".The guidance recommends:*keeping two metres apart from others wherever possible*wearing a face coveringyou can*using contactless payment where possible*avoiding rush hour travel where feasible*washing or sanitising your hands as soon as possible before and after travel and*following advice from staff and being considerate to others.The new advice follows the announcement of a pound billion package of cycling and walking investment for England that will deliver a ldquogreen revolution in travel, aiming to ease the pressure on public transport services by helping more people than ever choose alternative forms of travel.This includes pound million for local authorities in England to create pop-up bike lanes with protected space for cycling, wider pavements, safer junctions, and cycle and bus-only corridors.The overall expenditure will produce a knock-on windfall for the Scottish Government of around poundm via the Barnett Formula."},{"url":null,"title":"chancellor-rishi-sunak-extends-uk-govt-furlough-scheme-end-october-flexibility-part-time-work","story":"Responding to an Urgent Question asked by Labour in the House of Commons, the Chancellor explained that the Job Retention Scheme would run for another four months.Until the end of July, there would be no changes but from the start of August until the end of October the scheme would change to facilitate a sharing of the burden with employers of paying % of peoplersquos salaries, up to pound, a month.New statistics published today revealed the furlough scheme ndash described by Mr Sunak as a ldquoworld-leading economic intervention - had protected . million jobs and supported almost one million businesses.The Institute for Fiscal Studies calculated that extending the scheme in its current form for five months to the end of July would add an extra pound billion, bringing the total by then to around poundbn. The further three-month extension would push the overall cost higher.He said all sectors and regions of the UK would continue to be covered with greater flexibility to support the transition back to work.The Chancellor told MPs: \"Employers currently using the scheme will be able to bring furloughed employees back part-time. And we will ask employers to start sharing with the Government the cost of paying peoples salaries. Full details will follow by the end of May.\"But Mr Sunak, who turned  today, went on: ldquoI want to assure people today of one thing that wont change. Workers will through the combined efforts of Government and employers continue to receive the same level of overall support as they do now at % of their current salary up to pound, a month.\"Im extending the scheme because I wont give up on the people who rely on it. Our message today is simple: we stood behind Britains workers and businesses as we came into this crisis and we will stand behind them as we come through the other side.\"Later, when askedthe scheme could be extended beyond October, the Chancellor told the House that everything would be kept under review, noting: ldquoBut my expectation is by then the scheme should end. As I have said before we have stretched and strained to be as generous as possible to businesses and workers, which is why we have made the decision we have made today, which is important to me personally.ldquoBut, of course, as I have also said, this scheme is expensive. It is the right thing to do the cost of not acting would have been far higher.ldquoBut it is not something that can continue indefinitely into the future. Eight months of total support is a considerable amount of time and, now we have a plan from the Prime Minister with a path to reopening those parts of our economy that are closed, I believe we can get the country back on track, get people back into work and this scheme will help them to do it in a measured way, a phased way, and protect as many jobs as possible.Nicola Sturgeon gave the announcement a cautious welcome.Speaking at the Scottish Governmentrsquos daily briefing on Covid-, the First Minister said: ldquoAn extension to October is welcome. Hopefully, with the caveat that Irsquove not seen the detail yet, on the face of it that should avoid clf edges, where companies have to start redundancy processes because theyrsquore worried about the furlough scheme coming to an end within the timescale that they have to consult around redundancies.ldquoSo, it gives companies more time to do that and, hopefully, over that period we are going to see the further suppression of the virus and that, albeit gradual and perhaps relatively slow restart of the economy.She added: ldquoFrom what I have been able to gather so far, the Chancellorrsquos announcement is welcome but I will wait and see the detail before commenting any further on it.Jackson Carlaw, leader of the Scottish Conservatives said: ldquoWe all know that the Covid- pandemic represents a colossal economic threat as well as a public health crisis.ldquoThe Chancellor has today given millions of workers across Scotland economic security right through until October.ldquoIntroducing part-time flexibility into the scheme in July is something that businesses have been asking for and is very welcome.Mr Carlaw said the simplicity and clarity of the Chancellorrsquos message was striking.ldquoThis crisis is not over, there is still a long road ahead, but Scottish employees and employers have been given an enormous safety net, he added.In the Commons, Anneliese Dodds for Labour said many were taken aback by comments attributed to Government officials suggesting people need to be \"weaned off an addiction\" to the furlough scheme.The Shadow Chancellor said she had only heard about the Governmentrsquos changes \"in the last few seconds\" and will examine them \"very, very carefully\".Ms Dodds said people do not want to be furloughed, adding in the Commons: \"Its critically important they are not penalised for that choice. We welcome the flexibility mentioned, weve asked for this repeatedly.\"Mr Sunak replied: \"The use of the word addiction is not one I have ever used and not one I agree with.\"Nobody who is on the furlough scheme wants to be on this scheme. People up and down this country believe in the dignity of their work, going to work, providing for their families, its not their fault their business has been asked to close or asked to stay at home.\"That is why I established this scheme to support these people and their livelihoods at this critical time.\"Alison Thewliss for the SNP asked the Chancellorhe recognised that removing or reducing wage support levels in the furlough scheme prematurely would increase Universal Credit claims and ldquoforce workers back to work before its safe for them and risk a second peak \"Mr Sunak replied: \"Just to clary, there will be no reduction in the level of support for those on the scheme. Its crystal clear those on the scheme have that reassurance the level of support that they receive will not be changed.\"Tory backbencher Mel Stride, who chairs the Commons Treasury Committee, said: ldquoThe extension of the furlough scheme, allowing furloughed employees to work part time, and with employers asked to contribute are all welcome steps from the Chancellor.\"However, he said the devil would be in the detail and the committee would carefully scrutinise the changes.ldquoThe Chancellor also said that there will be no changes to the scheme until July. This will be worrying for those who continue to fall through the gaps of the Governmentrsquos support measures such as the lack of furlough support to help cover idend income generated through self-employment.\"Outwith Westminster, Liz Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce hailed the furlough scheme extension as ldquogreat news.She said: ldquoBusinesses and employees across Scotland will be extremely relieved by the Chancellorrsquos decision to extend the furlough scheme to October rather than face a clf edge with its originally planned withdrawal at the end of June.ldquoThis direct employee financial support has been a leline which has enabled many jobs to be retained rather than businesses having to face making massive redundancies. As we begin to consider a lsquo to workplacersquo plan to restart the economy, flexibility in these schemes will be paramount to protecting jobs until businesses are able to trade normally once more.Ms Cameron said the SCC looked forward to seeing further detail on the proposed employersrsquo contribution.ldquoWe would ask that this takes into consideration, particularly for SMEs, their ability to pay contributions depending on how quickly their income recovers as lock down eases. Trading conditions will dfer depending on location and sector and the flexibility of the furlough scheme must take these factors on board.ldquoWe will continue our engagement with the Treasury to make sure business support remains flexible and accessible for Scottish businesses, she added.Andrew McRae, the Federation of Small Business Scotlandrsquos Policy Chairman, said: ldquoTodayrsquos shrewd decisions from the Chancellor will give thousands of large and small Scottish employers the right sort of flexibility. The move to allow operators to partially furlough their staff while they consider how to get back up to speed should mean more businesses have the right tools at their disposal.ldquoIn the coming weeks, smaller firms will want to understand the next steps for the scheme. Policymakers will need to carefully consider how to co-ordinate financial support for businesses with advice to firms about how and when to reopen safely, he added.Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI Director-General, said firms would want more detail and asked for ministers to be willing to be flexiblethere were a second peak.ldquoExtending the furlough to avoid a June clf-edge continues the signicant efforts made already and will protect millions of jobs.\"Introducing much-needed flexibility is extremely welcome. It will prepare the ground for firms that are reawakening, while helping those who remain in hibernation. Thats essential as the UK economy revives step-by-step, while supporting livelihoods.\"Edwin Morgan for the Institute of Directors said plans for part-time s by the Government were welcome.\"A part-time furlough provides a much-needed launch ramp so businesses can start to get back up to speed.

Had Covid- not swept the world, the Perthshire-born athlete would be in Malawi now on an expedition, and preparing for a big race in America.But while his day-to-day le looks very dferent, he is making the most of lockdown by spending time with his family and continuing to make an impact on causes he believes in.:Exercise in coronavirus lockdown more than once a day  Thats optimismHe said: ldquoTherersquos two reasons [for setting up this challenge], one is trying to make a dference to frontline healthcare charities but the other, which is equal to me, is giving people something positive to focus on they can really commit to.ldquoThose are the things that people look back on positively and with a huge sense of purpose.Riders have joined from across the worldWith riders joining the Zoom sessions hailing from as far away as Australia, New Zealand and Dubai, it is truly an international effort and the challenge, in some ways, could be seen as a metaphor for the bloom in community spirit and support that has taken root globally.Mr Beaumont said: ldquoA lot of people who have taken part thought they could never do something like this, whether itrsquos , ,  or the  miles, itrsquos a really tough challenge. The wonderful thing about sport is not just the physical aspect but also being connected to a community of people also pitting themselves against something dficult.ldquoThe real le-affirming stuff often comes from being outside of your comfort zone because thatrsquos what defines us. Not just to take the easy road. I think that through the struggle and the sense of connecting with people, wersquoll look back and wersquoll say, lsquoman, that was tough but it felt good and Irsquom in a better place for itrsquo."},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon-tells-english-firms-treat-scottish-staff-differently","story":"The First Minister said thatfirms had staff living in Scotland, they should follow the Scottish Governments lockdown guidance ldquowherever your head office is, wherever yoursquore based, not necessarily expect them toto work in the same manneras staff living in England.She said that included staff living in Scotland whose normal workplace was just over the border in England.The Scottish lockdown istighter than the UK Government version, which was changed this week for Englandwith the ldquostay at home message replaced by ldquostay alertThe UK version says people in England should work at home where possible, but says ldquofood production, construction, manufacturing, logistics, distribution and scientic research in laboratories should be open.The Scottish guidance is for construction to be closed.The UK guidance says it should be \"considered alongside local public health and safety requirements for Scotland\", but does not say which guidancetakes precedence.However at the Scottish Governmentrsquos daily briefing on Covid-, Ms Sturgeon was clear thatthe Scottish advice must apply to workers living in Scotland, eventhey normally commuted to work in England.She began by urging employers in Scotland not to reopen prematurely or put pressure on employees toto work too soon.She said: ldquoI know that the UK Government published guidance for businesses yesterday.ldquoI want to stress that this guidance is not yet operational in Scotland at this stage, since we are not currently encouraging more people to go back to work.ldquoI would ask instead that all employers follow the Scottish Government guidance.ldquoI am very grateful for the fact that the vast majority of employers have been so responsible throughout this crisis ndash so I am sure that most will do this, and will not urge workers to come back to work prematurely.ldquoAnd for employees, I would remind you thatyou think your working conditions are unsafe, you have rights under employment legislation.ldquoIf you have a trade union in your workplace, and you have concerns about your working conditions, you should also be able to talk to them.ldquoThe Scottish Government is working with employers and trade unions to develop guidance on safe workplaces which has the confidence of businesses and workers.Askedher message was the same to employers south of the border, for example in and around Carlisle, who had workers currently living in Scotland,Ms Sturgeon replied: ldquoYes, unequivocally.\"She went on: \"My message applied to all employers, clearly employing people who work in Scotland, I would hope all employers across the UK would be responsible, but my responsibility of course is for those who live in Scotland.ldquoSo I would say to employers, wherever your head office is, wherever yoursquore based,you are employing people who live in Scotland, have regard to the Scottish Government guidance. Indeed, that is what the UK Government would tell you to do as well.ldquoWe are going through a process that will allow us, at the right time and in the right phasing, to give people the confidence that they can go back to work safely.Asked about reports that Burger King, McDonaldrsquos and Starbucks were planning to reopen some outlets in Scotland despite the lockdown, Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoRight now, because our progress against this virus is fragile, we must be cautious.ldquoWe must not prematurely lt these restrictions and risk the virus running out of control.ldquoI make no apology for being cautious about this and I would say to employers of all shapes and sizes, and all sectors, You should be following in Scotland, Scottish Government advice.ldquoWe are not yet encouraging any businesses that are not open right now, or any workers who are not working right now, to be back in operation.ldquoOf course that will change in the weeks ahead and we want to get back to as close to normal operation for businesses as quickly as possible, but that has to be done safely, and it has to be done in the right order, so we can give workers confidence they are safe as they can be."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"May ,  at : pmThe furlough scheme, which pays the wages of workers on leave due to coronavirus, has been extended to October, the UK Government chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced.

More than half of UK farmers have had their milk price cut due to the disruption.“It is good to see the dairy industry taking the initiative here but this does not let our governments off the hook. They need to do more#, the MP said,  #with restaurants closed and orders from vital export markets down, our dairy farmers need help to keep going.#They face challenges that cannot be papered over through programmes of worker support. You cannot furlough a dairy cow. The costs of feeding and milking continue regardless. In other sectors you can put production into hibernation until the markets re-open. You can#t do that for dairy products.#He continued: “The farming minister has just announced new funding to support dairy farmers in England due to the current crisis. I hope that all authorities will act where they can to mitigate the impact. There are roles here for the UK and Scottish Governments and for our local councils. They all need to step up to the plate.“Dairy farmers in Orkney worked hard to establish a brand recognised as being a high-quality product.  If we do not support them during these challenging times then we risk that work being wasted.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While guidance to local councils suggested the former, a recent response from the Tourism Secretary, Fergus Ewing to Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart suggested the latter.Mr McArthur wrote to finance secretary, Kate Forbes, seeking clarity and has been told that  days of bookings are required in order to be able to access support. But Orkney’s MSP has pointed to claims by the Association of Scotland’s Self-Caterersthat requiring  days of bookings unfairly excludes most self-caterers who operate in areas where the tourism season is typically shorter, such as rural and island communities.Mr McArthur said: “Getting the eligibility criteria right for these funding schemes was never going to be easy. The Finance Secretary deserves credit, however, for being willing to make changes based on feedback from myself and MSP colleagues, as well as businesses directly.“However, almost two months into the lockdown, and it is clear that many self-catering businesses in Orkney are still falling through the gaps, despite being able to evidence self-catering as a primary source of income.  This not only threatens the future of these inidual businesses but also potentially Orkney’s wider tourism sector.“The situation has not been helped by contradictions in the advice offered by dferent Ministers. The Finance Secretary has now addressed this confusion over eligibility criteria, but at the same time confirmed the sense that the bar has been set very high for applicants in many rural and island areas.“As the ASSC point out, expecting self-caterers in the islands to be able to evidence almost five months of bookings for their property is often unrealistic given that the tourism season is typically shorter here than in other parts of the country.“I have urged the Finance Secretary to look again at the criteria to ensure that they are properly ‘island proofed’ under the terms of the Islands Act.  While there is a need to avoid making scheme rules overly-complex or confusing, it is also important that they achieve fairness for businesses wherever they happen to be based.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now, why does not Nicola change the dictate for Shetland  We would love to sunbath also, between the snow showers!!!!!😂😂😂😂How fortunate that the Scottish, Welsh and Irish leaders are maintaining their more sensible , balanced and wary approaches .Enlighten us Haydn, why is the infection rate lowerin England than in Wales and Scotland  I for one am not the least confused by the messages, just what is confusing you She niver agrees wIth what the rest off the UK IS DOINGBruce, you make it look asNicola, is acting like a Tory##..The Tory policy being##..me, me, me and melolSince you appear to not know, there has been confusion in Britain today about the actual meaning of BoJo’s statement yesterdayand , as I write, he is trying to explain himself away on TV. THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alBo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!.."},{"url":null,"title":"convener this isnt the time for national leaders to be playing politics ","story":"That was the call from Shetland Islands Council convener Malcolm Bell after Prime Minister Boris Johnson adopted a dfering stance on exiting lockdown than his devolved counterparts, including First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.But Mr Bell believes there is little distance between the prime minister and first minister on how best to progress, at least once the political posturing between the two is taken out of the equation.National media reports highlighted dferences of opinion in the two leaders after Mr Johnson set out plans to mody the lockdown south of the border with a broadcast on Sunday evening.He fleshed out the details in the House of Commons on Monday, amid criticism that there was a lack of clarity about the message emanating from Westminster.Officials and elected representatives are eager to keep the “R” infection rate below one, which means each existing infection causes less than one new infection, meaning the disease will decline and eventually die out.: “There’s maybe not as much distance between the prime minister and the first minister as the language suggests. The dference appears to be largely in emphasis and timing.“But this isn’t the time for our national leaders to be playing politics. It’s critical that we have a clear message that people continue to follow the advice and guidelines.”The convener said he was not too concerned that dferent parts of the UK were thinking about the lockdown exit dferently.“In one sense everybody talks about ‘the science’. There’s no such thing as ‘the science’. There’s ‘science’, and as long as they’re taking their evidence from the same science it could be perfectly reasonable for dferent parts of the UK to go at a slightly dferent pace.“You can find a scientist to back up whatever you want. I’m concerned they are now going to start using this to emphasise political dferences. I think I would expect more from our leaders at a time of national emergency.”Mr Bell stressed people had to get back to work at some time, especiallythey wanted to preserve things like the “world-class health service” which they benefit from.He added that, when that time comes, #we do have to show the same sort of courage and commitment that our key workers at the moment – our health workers, bus drivers, ferry crews, care workers and shop assistants – are doing.”Following the prime minister’s address, residents in England will be able to carry out more outdoor exercise as of Wednesday.Mr Johnson also said primary schools south of the border may begin to re-open in June, as well as non-essential shops, while the hospitality industry could see operations begin again from July.He added people in England should be “actively encouraged” to go to workthey were unable to work from home.Mr Johnson said it would “soon be the time” to consider imposing a -day quarantine on people coming into the country by air.But the prime minister’s comments came as official data showed infections had risen in Germany, just days after the country eased its lockdown restrictions.Mr Johnson was criticised for his new “stay alert” message which he was advising in favour of keeping the “stay at home” dictum that has been the key message in tackling the virus head-on.Ms Sturgeon said the “core principles” of the lockdown measures remained in place, although she was willing to loosen restrictions enough to allow people to exercise outdoors more than once a day.She told journalists: “The objectives now for all of us must be to consolidate and solidy that progress. We mustn’t squander our progress by easing up too soon or by sending mixed messages that make people think it’s okay to ease up.”She added: “Let me be very blunt about the consequenceswe were to do that.

of","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere’s only so much looking at a blank page on screen that’s possible before you have to admitdefeat.In the absence of any golf, indeed any sports at all, and with a pledge to try not to add to the news and commentary around the Covid- crisis already made sometimes it’s very much a case of panic.So I decided to head off around the world.It’s easy.Even with nothing much flying, huge restrictions on general travel, and ‘lockdown’ still very much in evidence it’s still possible with a bit of imagination.Lots of things are.‘Around the World in  Trains’ by Monisha Rajesh is the kind of adventure that most of us probably, deep down, only dream about.The notion of giving everything up and heading off on a , mile journey by train, most of the time certainly not travelling first-class, with only the confidence of your publisher behind you, might terry most.The dference here being that Rajesh has a ‘track’ record hereand already had managed ‘Around India in  Trains’ to considerable acclaim.The ‘gamble’ wasn’t so much that everything hinged on the possibility of a book-deal, that the house might have to be sold to pay for the trip, or that anything could go possibly wrong: this was the sort of adventure that comes with the kind of safety net that wannabe travel writers might only care to dream about.The ‘gamble’ was a sure thing.The best kind.She loves train travel.She knows she already possesses a charming style and wit .She is fearless, adventurous, resourceful and confident.She probably had the advance in the bank and a Bloomsbury credit card tucked away somewhere safe.She took her fiancé to sell for body parts, just in case.The bases were covered.But it didn’t feel like that and, despite being incredibly jealous, you easily get sucked into her world of ‘roughing it’ amongst strange farts, loud snores, despicable train ‘etiquette’, and uncomfortable travel bedfellows, depending on which rails you are traversing.These strange times provide a unique opportunity for those of us who, luckily, can get lost inside their own heads.Days of reading and Netflix, YouTube documentaries and Sky box sets can keep the madness at bay whilst you head into the sixth straight week of nightsht.That and doing the lottery.You can disappear, both into your own and somebody ’s fantasy adventures, safe in the knowledge that you will never have the cojones to even challenge yourself to anything more dangerous than a co-op ‘seafood selection’ a couple of days beyond its ‘best before’ date, nor less basic than a -star hotel in exotic, far-flung, hot-spots like Cyprus or Tenere .I find myself vicariously earthy and ‘real’ eating a ‘three squeaks’ aperit after haggling with a one-legged hawker on a street corner, before hitting the hay for the fth consecutive night with a fellow traveller who now smells sweetly ripe, despite washing his feet where I shave.I’m adventurous, but only in my own head.I can yearn for the real, authentic, deal, but would probably settle for a ‘Westworld’ or ‘Total Recall’ futuristic implant.I could pack it in and head for the opal depletedmines of Coober Pedy, or the aptly named Opalton in Australia.Following in the footsteps, and bore holes, of prospectors who either struck it rich or went broke trying I’m there with the jack-hammer, just praying for a glint of green.Sold the Mondeo and the golf clubs, bought my claim and a second-hand excavator, and will surely strike it rich where every other damned fool either failed or moved on.Claiming a redundant, abandoned, dangerous, tunnel to the centre of the earth is the stuff of the original ‘ers.Except they’d have got there first.I’d make a great Outback Opal Hunter: I’ve got the Drizabone hat, with corks, and am getting used to working in the dark with headlights.Maybe I’ll start digging around in the shed and see what I could find to take to auction.Become a Pawnstar or Auction

Grant has called on Health Secretary Jeane Freeman to disclose how all separate bits of government advice had been passed on to care homes by the Scottish Government.She added: “I understand the Home

this is the case, what additional action was taken to protect residents ”Highlands and Islands Tory MSP Donald Cameron echoed calls for extra testing.He said: “The focus must be on testing care home workers to reassure them that they are free of the disease and to minimise the chances of care homes being infected.“It’s a sad fact that the proportion of deaths from Covid- in care settings in Scotland has been high and, as testing here has been carried out at a relatively low rate, it is right that there should be a great national effort to improve matters.“I believe it would also help to

When distributing the care packages it was very apparent how grateful and appreciative people were, even just for us as a band to be thinking of them.Its not until youre on the ground can you fully appreciate just how isolated some people are during this period, so for us as a band to be able to help those people is fantastic.Wed just like to express our thanks to Ballymena and Harryville Apprentice Boys of Derry branch club for reaching out to us and giving us the opportunity to help our community.I think it shows perfectly what bands and loyal orders are all about, and thats helping their communities and being there for one another.

Chris Branniganis working to support the NHS in planning the delivery of personal protection equipmentand mobile Covid- testing centres.He has had to stay away from his young family in Surrey for the last five weeks, as his daughter Hastisuffers from a rare neuro-degenerative condition requiring her to stay in isolation.Cornelia de Lange Syndromecauses children to seriously deteriorate in adolescence, with symptoms including severe mental health challenges like self-harm, mutism, anxiety and depression.There is currently no cure or treatment, but the family - including mum Hengamehand children Amirand Navid- are raising funds for pioneering research into gene therapy which could give Hasti hope.In January, a goal of £, was set to fund initial research of which over £, has been raised so far.The money will pay to develop a #proof of concept# treatment, which could then proceed to clinical trials.Covid- has halted most fundraising events for now, but Hasti has been able to raise £, herself with a cycling challenge.Mr Brannigan said he is now fighting against the clock to give Hasti, and hundreds of others, a chance as the proposed therapy will not be effective in older children.It could be going a lot betterI#m honest, we#ve had to cancel dozens of fundraising events, he said. But the dficult circumstances make the donations we are getting so much more special.I#ve been away from home for five weeks as it was just too risky to bring the virus home unwittingly while we#re trying to shield Hasti.Being away has been really dficult. We celebrated my son#s birthday last month and it was hard not being there for a proper celebration.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseChris and Hasti Brannigan before the lockdown FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappChris and Hasti Brannigan before the lockdownHe added: In the past when I#ve been on army operations you at least knew your family was safe, but I don#t want to be the reason I#m putting them in danger.Mr Brannigan has been keeping up bedtime stories with his daughter via video call every night, but explaining the reality of Covid- has been hard.I think she understands the wider circumstances but doesn#t really accept why I need to be away. She asks me every night, #Are you coming home today, Daddy # and I have to say no.He is now hoping the latest measures to ease the lockdown in England mean he will be able to work from home safely within weeks.Once the £, total for research has been reached, the family will face another dficult choice. Assuming the research all comes good we can fund the clinical trials ourselves. They are incredibly expensive though and cost millions of pounds, Mr Brannigan said.The other option is that once we have a gene therapy that we know works and is safe, it#s likely that pharmaceutical companies will come forward to purchase the intellectual property rights and run the clinical trials. That is potentially fraught with peril for us though because we would lose control of the timescale, as they#re under no pressure.Also, the potential is that Hasti wouldn#t be included in the trials despite the fact that we#ve done the hard miles to create the gene therapy ourselves. But we#re doing everything we can to give her the best chance.Further information on Hasti#s story is available at www.hopeforhasti.org.

PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe Stormont Executive is to set up a working group to help ensure the smooth travel of airline passengers during the Covid- pandemic. By Mark BainMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Stormont Executive is to set up a working group to help ensure the smooth travel of airline passengers during the Covid- pandemic.It follows the announcement from Prime Minister Boris Johnston that passengers coming into the UK will be required to isolate for two weeks, although those arriving from France and the Republic would be exempt.But officials in the Republic have insisted a similar exemption will not be reciprocated for people travelling to the Republic from Great Britain.Sinn Fein junior minister Declan Kearney told the Executive#s daily Covid- press conference that Stormont has been working closely with London and Dublin over air travel.Conversations were held last week in relation to how this particular issue would and should be addressed. There is an acceptance amongst all the administrations that there is effectively a common travel area between these islands, that#s the appropriate stance to adapt.However, iniduals who would travel into these islands from abroad will then be expected to accept a two week lockdown and isolation period. We have made the point to the British Government that in circumstances where perhaps someone has travelled into Britain from continental Europe or where who may then travel on to a destination in the  counties that their details are shared with authorities in the south in order to maintain a consistency in their approach to dealing with iniduals who should be adhering to a two week isolation.DUP junior minister Gordon Lyons added: There will be a working group set up to ensure the proper exceptions are in place. It is obviously important that the common travel area is maintained and that will require further conversations with our own government and the Irish Government as well.Meanwhile, in the Republic it has emerged that gardai will be given the power to check up on air passengers arriving from overseas. This could include gardai calling to the addresses of passengers to ensure they are self-isolating for two weeks after their arrival.Strict new regulations are being drafted to make it a legal requirement for anyone arriving in the Republic to self-isolate and give the authorities details of where they will be staying.Using emergency legislation to allow gardai to police the new rules is a key proposal in the plans being discussed by senior ministers.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They include Cara Doranfrom north Belfast, who for the past six years has been a receptionist at Belfast#s Merchant Hotel, a casualty of the Covid- crisis and now closed along with countless other bars and restaurants.With no idea when she will be back behind her desk in the lobby, Cara was keen to use her free time to make a dference through volunteering.Now for six days a week she is one of the #soup-er heroes# making deliveries throughout the greater Shankill area to the most vulnerable, elderly and those in need.On a typical day Cara packs her car full of deliveries before heading to around  homes, where people of all ages are isolating from the virus.After a few days of being at home when the hotel closed I just knew that I had to do something during this pandemic, Cara said.With all this free time on my hands, I couldn#t just sit about not helping out people in need. I saw an advert on Facebook that the Spectrum Centre were seeking drivers for soup deliveries and got in touch.It#s contact-free work where I deliver the soup and leave it outside the homes, rap the door and then walk away.Cara says the work has been really fulfilling.Everyone is friendly and very appreciative. Some are quite lonely and do like to have a chat, which is fine, and I do.From a mental health point of view, doing this is a great help as it gets you motivated to get up and go out.If I can help out in any way when this is all over, I will stay involved with the centre, Cara added.Meanwhile, Joan Murphyis four weeks into her stint delivering soup with the same group, having been furloughed from her job at the Movie House Cinema at Yorkgate, where she has worked for  years.I locked the cinema doors for the last time on St Patrick#s Day and it was a really weird feeling not knowing when the projectors would be back on again, Joan said.After two weeks of pacing the floor I knew that I needed to be doing something and started following some community pages on social media who needed drivers for delivery.Giving up a few hours for three days each week really isn#t that much, but you get to know those you meet on the run and your fellow volunteers.I#m loving being a part of this as I#m getting a lot out of it and it gives your week some structure too. Plus I#m getting to know parts of Belfast I had never been to before.Tens of thousands of food packages are also being delivered to those who are shielding, the financially vulnerable or people who may be experiencing dficulties physically accessing food.Numerous local voluntary groups are involved, including Cregagh Community Association in east Belfast, and it#s where Joanne Snoddenhelps to deliver  food and essential items parcels every Friday.The mum-of-two was a children#s play worker with Venture Kids after school club and was keen to help others in whatever way she could.It gives me a reason to get up, dressed and get out there, Joanne explained.We put the parcels together in Mount Merrion Church and then normally ide the runs up so you take about six each.Last Friday when I dropped off a parcel with one wee man he just burst into tears he was so happy.My daughter was in the car at the time and she asked me why he was crying, so I had to explain it was because he was thankful as he can#t get out himself.This has also been a chance for her to learn the importance of helping others.Elsewhere Maura O#Brienfrom Glengormley was previously an administrator with a construction firm for over three years before being furloughed on April .Now she is using her free time to do shopping for an elderly couple who are self-isolating after registering with the Volunteer Now website.It#s a chance to give something back because initially I felt a sense of guilt that I was still being paid to do nothing whilst others are working hard on the front line, Maura said.I phone the couple every week, get their order for groceries the next day, do the shopping and then leave it on their porch.At this stage I know their shopping list better than my own.They are a lovely couple and you could easily sit and talk to them all day on the phone.I#m glad to be doing this as I can#t get to see my own parents back in Co Tyrone at the moment.You#d love to be able to do more but every little helps.I#d urge anyone considering doing something to help others so just get out there and do it, she added.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

While this emergency situation has brought their contribution to the fore, we must recognise the importance of their role in caring for us, and our families, throughout our lives.When we come out the other side of this crisis, one of the positives we can take from it is ensuring that our nurses and other health and social care staff get the recognition they deserve.A range of local landmarks, monuments and council buildings will be illuminated blue, the colour of the nurse, tomorrow evening.Professor Greta Westwood, CEO of the Florence Nightingale Foundation, said: Florence Nightingale, herself a trailblazer during her career, would have been proud at the way nurses have followed in her footsteps as pioneers and leaders in the fight against the pandemic.

Mrs Foster said the Executive#s new five-stage plan will be subject to change, depending on the progress made in tackling the pandemic.Read MoreMargaret Canning:Opinion Rooted in realism, but the plan to lt coronavirus lockdown in NI is coy about dates“We don’t want to keep any restriction in place any longer than we have to, but in relaxing any measure we must be cognisant of the potential effects in the transmission of the virus and our ability to save lives, she said. “The Executive’s recovery strategy sets out a pathway for us to emerge from lockdown in the safest way possible. This will require a series of judgments and decisions as we move forward. These decisions will be evidence based, taking account of our unique circumstances here in Northern Ireland.Read More Five steps toto sport: Northern Ireland Executive plan sees golf and tennis among first to come back during coronavirus pandemicDeputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill added: “We don’t underestimate the impact that the severe restrictions have had on everyone across our society. While they are still absolutely necessary, it is important that we give people hope for the future.“Today we have set out our pathway for future recovery which gives an indication of how the restrictions on dferent aspects of le may be eased at ious stages.While the restrictions are to be reviewed every three weeks as set out in law, the First Minister Arlene Foster said they would be continually examined to determine when to lt restrictions. The first ministers have said it is important there is flexibility in the process and steps could go forwards as well as backwards depending on the virus spread.On not including dates in the plan, Michelle O#Neill said: We looked very carefully at the issue of putting timelines and specic dates to certain areas and we decided against that for the reason that people want light at the end of the tunnel and we don#t want to build up expectation and then you have to move back.We have built in enough flexibility to this programme thatthe chief scientic officer were to sit down tomorrow and say we#re now at . , for example, we could move into step one ahead of the three weeks.The Executive has outlined guiding principles that will be taken into consideration as the lockdown is lted.The principles are controlling the transmission of Covid-, protecting healthcare capacity to deal with the virus, retaining restrictions only as long as necessary, ensuring restrictions are proportionate to the threat of the virus and using the best evidence to inform proposals for change.Here is what the plan says:Step oneGroups of four to six people who are not from the same household being able to meet outdoors while maintaining social distancing. With the exception of people who are shielding, visits to immediate family allowed indoors where social distancing is possible.Drive-through church services, churches opening for private prayer, opening of outdoor spaces and public sport amenities, drive-through cinemas and more sports, including some water activities, golf and tennis.More encouraged toto workthey can#t at home on a phased basis and with measures to protect workers in place.And large outdoor retailers such as garden centres can open although associated cafes and restaurants can only be takeaway. Step twoGroups of  able to meet outdoors, team sports training on a non-contact basis in small groups, re-opening of some libraries and open-air museums, as well as indoor activities involving limited contact of less than  minutes and with two to four people.Non-food retailers can open with limited numbers of customers to allow for social distancing. A wider definition of key workers with their children able to use schools. People encouraged to walk or cycle instead of using public transportpossible. Anticipated increase in public transport with challenges on ensuring social distancing.Step threeGroups of up to  able to gather outside, re-opening of more libraries as well as museums and galleries, concert and theatre rehearsals resuming and larger indoor gatherings.Phasedof office and onsite working following risk assessments. But staff that can work from home should continue to do so.Education toto schools. With expansion of provision to accommodate a number of priority cohorts on a part time basis with a blended learning approach involving a combination of in-school and remote learning. Step fourSocially distanced church services, resumption of competitive sport behind closed doors or with a limited number of spectators, leisure centres re-opening and outdoor concerts resuming on a restricted basis.Hairdressers, fitness studios and tattoo piercing parlous can reopen, subject to restrictions and after risk assessments. School s for all - but on a part time basis with on campus and remote learning. Expected increase in public transport use. Demand reduced by encouraging through continued home working and staggered starts for businesses to assist social distancing. Social distancing requirements remain in place. People to be encouraged to walk and cycle for short journeys where possible.Step fiveResumption of close physical contact sports,of competitive sport, spectators at live events on a restricted basis as wellReturn to work for all - subject to restrictions and remote working still encouraged. Restaurants, cafes, pubs, nightclubs and concerts can resume subject to risk assessment, on a limited basis to start with.Further expansion of school provision.

Peter Marley has been using the restrictions on movement to work on a series of portraits.#Sociable Distance# is the working title of his special project, an ongoing series of photographs captured during the Covid- pandemic.He explained how he has been using his daily walk to make images that create a time capsule of this unusual period in which we find ourselves.I#ve been making portraits with friends, neighbours and strangers, all from a responsible distance, he said.And it has been a great way to stay connected to a community whilst documenting the much quieter streets of Belfast.Peter , from Glenarf, Co Antrim, is married to -year-old Zjena, a costume designer who is originally from Croatia. They are expecting their first child.He normally works in the TV and film industry, but as that has come to global standstill he has turned his hand to this innovative challenge.To date his series comprises around  pieces and has gained momentum over the last few weeks as people have started to learn of his unique project.But although he suggested that he may hit , he stressed that he never really works with a target in mind, adding: That adds more pressure to how I work and makes it more goal-orientated as opposed to being an organic process.Peter said: I respond to people getting in touch with me but I also chat to neighbours and strangers to give the project a little spontaneity.It allows me to meet people who aren#t in my immediate friend circle or extended neighbour group.A few would also be the unemployed film community, it#s almost like checking in on them, just to have a chat, and then quite a few of them would be strangers who got in touch with me after exposure of the project online, or strangers I found in their garden enjoying the sun or at the doorstep.Having worked on portrait projects before, Peter said the idea for this one came from him checking in on friends who where nearby but hadn#t really had anyone to chat with.I#ve done similar things to document changes going on around the country or strange events whenever they pop up, he said.So this was almost to create a time capsule for something that doesn#t happen too often where people are instantly changing their day to day habits.Everything like shopping has gone from a daily convenience to a weekly extravagance.People have been very responsive and very quick to change their habits, from getting coffee on the street to preparing at home. Even thought the portraits were a way of making sure friends and family were okay, it was also a way of documenting how quickly our local community had changed.Hopefully that will be a record for .Perhaps the most striking thing for Peter has been the positivity of the people he has encountered on the way.There is an undercurrent of concern and worry but beyond that people are generally looking out for each other, he said.Some are running errands for their older neighbours. There#s a real compassion within the community.It#s warm and fantastic to see. If I had been told to imagine a dystopian future where people were wearing masks I would never have thought it was going to be so polite.Peter said that once the series is complete he hopes to hold an exhibition locally and produce a photobook of his work.My projects tend to culminate in an isolated photobook of portraits, he said.But this time I#ve also tried to include street photography just to give a wider context.And because of the phenomenal weather we#ve been having the portraits have an almost too positive a hue so I#m including deserted places, a lot of the signage relating to Covid- and the amount of discarded plastic gloves to give it a wider context for  and quarantine - otherwise it#s just a lot of people having barbecues.The main thing is to document what#s happening during lockdown and create a record of it.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Paddy Simpson, of Fortuna Enterprises Ltd, owns Brunswick Moviebowl in Pennyburn Industrial Estate as well as two hotels in Belfast. With the British government’s poundbn job-retention scheme running until the end of June, Mr Simpson has said financial support must be ‘tapered’ as businesses begin to reopen at reduced capacity so they can afford to pay staff. Under the scheme - known as furloughing - the government covers % of the wages of workers who are staying at home during the coronavirus pandemic and not working at all, up to a cap of pound, a month. googletag.cmd.push The Moviebowl houses a cinema, restaurant bar, bowling alley, cafeacute and children’s adventure playpark amongst other attractions. Mr Simpson employs around  staff -  in Derry - who have been furloughed during the crisis. At the weekend, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced the Irish government’s roadmap to reopen society and business. The NI Executive is expected to outline its own pathway out of lockdown in the coming days. Once businesses reopen it will be on the basis of reduced capacity and strictly adhering to social distancing guidelines. In line with that guidance, staff will alsoto work in fewer numbers. Staff and customer safety is a matter of utmost importance, Mr Simpson said. googletag.cmd.push When the coronavirus first emerged bars in Derry led the way by announcing closures on March , including The Blackbird, Paedar O’Donnell’s and the Gweedore. The following day Brunswick Moviebowl decided to close its doors while encouraging its employees to use the time wisely to look after the most vulnerable during the pandemic. Brave decisions made by local businesses at that time have been widely praised and are believed to have saved lives. It was not until a full week later, March , that the British government officially ordered businesses to close under law. Mr Simpson said that with all the uncertainty at the time it was a ‘tough’ decision to make but he knew it was the right one. “It was tough, but people were ahead of the government because they just weren’t coming out at that stage. “That Sundaywe were empty. I think we did  lunches that Sunday and we’d normally do about . “It feels like a year ago already,” he said. Initially, the company had to pay staff but the announcement of a furlough scheme came as a relief. “We didn’t know how long it was going to go on. The big worry was how we were going to pay staff, everybody has bills. “But in fairness the furloughing scheme has been brilliant, that can’t be denied. And that took a lot of the pressure off.” ROADMAP The Irish government’s roadmap for reopening society and business sets out five phases with the first beginning on May  and the last on August . The Irish government’s plan states that cafeacutes and restaurants providing on-premises food and beverages can re-open at phase , June . They must comply with social distancing and strict cleaning protocols. Indoor recreational venues are set to reopen on August , where numbers can be limited, cleaning can be maintained, and social distancing can be complied with. The final phase is the one that is most applicable to Mr Simpson and Brunswick Moviebowl as that is when pubs, bowling alleys and cinemas can reopen in the south. Mr Simpson has welcomed the Irish government proposals saying ‘it looks fair enough’ and shows ‘light at the end of the tunnel’. “The biggest worry will be how theyend the furlough. If they suddenly say you can open on the th of August and everybody is off furloughed: with social distancing and other measures you’ll not be fit to bring back all the staff at the one time.” The Irish Government described its plan as a ‘phased flexible roadmap’ and said it has a ‘clear way of deciding’ when it can move from one phase of reopening to the next’ with a focus on minimising the number of people who get the infection, and the number of deaths as a result. In terms of that timeline, Mr Simpson said it will be a ‘numbers game’ and it will depend on how the numbers look at the time. “I think it could end up moving either way, backwards or forward,” he added. FURLOUGH There are concerns amongst restauranteurs that reopening with half the number of customers would not be profitable. Askedthat was a concern for the Moviebowl andhe envisages opening dferent parts of the building at dferent times, Mr Simpson said: “No, I think we would manage that.” He expects that once permitted to do so, the facility will open in its entirety with the exception of the Bananas Adventure Park as it would be impossible to ensure social distancing amongst young children. Mr Simpson is hopeful that the NI Executive will lay out its own roadmap soon as ‘everybody needs a bit of guidance’. “The biggest worry is looking after your staff and customers, and furloughing can’t just stop on a particular date because businesses won’t open up with the same number of staff until things go back to normal. “The furlough scheme needs to be tapered in some way so that it carries on. “We have  staff in Derry and you’re probably going to be opening with  or . And over the weeks and months you’d be taking them back gradually.” He concluded: “The Moviebowl will start out with reduced capacity and we’ll have to see how it goes from there.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

James O’Donnell frequently takes photos of his beloved dog ‘Iggy’ in some of the most spectacular locations around the county. And she is now becoming a bit of a celebrity with thousands of people all over the world going online to see the Border Collie with stunning Donegal backdrops behind her. In one week recently, Iggy-related photos reached over a quarter of a million people on facebook. Falcarragh-based James has been building up a collection of photos with nine-year-old Iggy, and his work has attracted a lot of attention. googletag.cmd.push Indeed, in March, he had been scheduled to go to America for a number of exhibitions, starting in Florida. But the onset of Covid- meant the flights had to be cancelled. Nevertheless, he is hoping to go to New York later in the summer for another exhibition and possibly also to Connecticut. His talent is such that his work has attracted the attention of highly regarded veteran Magnum Photos member Elliott Erwittand Samuel Holmes , and through them steps were put in place for the planned exhibitions. The fact that they have been in contact highlights just what an impact James is making. googletag.cmd.push After World War II, a number of photographers banded together to form Magnum Photos, an organisation dedicated to chronicling world events - and named for the magnum-sized bottle of wine that they drank at each meeting! The process of becoming a full member of Magnum Photos takes a minimum of four years. Photographers are only considered once a year, during Magnums Annual General Meeting in June, where one day is set aside for considering and voting on potential new members portfolios. It is highly prestigious. “I love promoting Donegal,” James said, pointing out that he actually takes all his photos on his mobile phone! James lived in London for many years, before ing home to Donegal, and he adores the outside world and doing his bit to showcase and promote the county in any way that he can. Last year he produced a calendar called “Iggy’s Donegal” - filled with fine pictures from ramblings and hikes around Donegal - and it proved to be very popular. Recently a photo taken by James attracted the attention of BBC Northern Ireland weather forecaster Barra Best. Best tweeted the photo and commented that it was a “great example” of “an extremely rare phenomenon” known as Kelvin-Helmholtz clouds. The stunning imageof the cloud formation was taken from the Back Strand in Falcarragh, and needless to say, also featured Iggy. All the indications are that Iggy is on the way to being a great ambassador for Donegal, and while this will be a terribly dficult year for those in the tourism sector here, at least James and Iggy are publicising to the world some of the great sights to see. The story made the front page of this week’s Donegal Post newspaper and is featured in this Thursday’s Donegal Democrat .

Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice. Still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that theyre gone.”  - Morgan Freeman as Red in the Shawshank Redemption Netflix delivered a gem to the sporting fraternity recently in the form of The Last Dance, a behind the scenes documentary following the Chicago Bulls during their six NBA titles in eight seasons during the s. It was casual watching and not needing much concentration, but interesting on a range of dferent levels. googletag.cmd.push The footage of Michael Jordan was just enthralling. His demand for the highest of standards turned around the fortunes of the underperforming Bulls. His brilliance gave him locker room clout beyond his newcomer status. His power to jump and score was sizzling. When he leapt off the court, he was a genius. The Bulls went from winning just over a third of their games to pushing for glory and he was named as Rookie of the Year in his first season. As the series began to pan out, it was centred around three main players and their personalities – Jordan, Scottie Pippen and later Dennis Rodman. googletag.cmd.push Tangled in the storyline was Scottie being grossly underpaid for what he was offering the team. It led to a fallout with the franchise General Manager Jerry Krause. One glance at Dennis Rodman made me think more about team dynamics. He is the ultimate maverick. He came from a broken home but somehow escaped the drug culture that passed by in front of his eyes. The day he lted a basketball saved him. A family friend saw enough to tip off a local school basketball coach and it was his passport to college and eventually the Detroit Pistons. The Pistons were labelled the bad-boys of the NBA. They got into teams faces and under their skins and they developed nasty rivalry with the Bulls. Rodman morphed into one of their most influential players and built up a terric relationship with coach Chuck Daly. So much so, than when Daly – a father figure almost – resigned, Dennis went off the rails. He was a troubled inidual and demanded a transfer. He also dated music star Madonna who convinced him that he needed to express himself and be who he wanted to be and not how others wanted him to fit. HUNCH After a spell with the San Antonio Spurs, Rodman moved on to the Bulls. It was a gamble. The club hierarchy went on a hunch that Dennis would be safe due to the presence of Jordan and Pippen and how they would steer and inspire him. The other factor was the most important – coach Phil Jackson. They knew he could handle him. A glance at Rodman and he is not your everyday player. Tattoos, jewellery all over his face and a hairstyle that changes day on day. Even on one occasion, he had bleached all through his hair, to mark his teammatesto the court from injury. Rodman made me think of that line from the Shawshank Redemption. The one Red mutters when the innocent Andy is on the the brink of escape – some birds are too beautul to cage. And Rodman knew his worth. “Youve got the great Michael Jordan, the great Scottie Pippen and the greatPhil Jackson...you take me away from this team...do they still win the championship  I dont think so,” was one of his comments during the documentary. Everybody  knew it too. In  when the Bulls were chasing their sixth title, Rodman requested some leave time in mid-season and was granted  hours. As Jordan expected, Dennis went AWOL in Las Vegas and they had to go to get him back. Onto training, Jackson put the Bulls through their paces to blow the black smoke out of Rodmans system from his time off the rails. The old fashioned back to the front runs. During laps the player at the back had to sprint to the front, all the way around the court. The GAA pre-season drill from hell. The Bulls players plotted to take it easy on Rodman -and themselves – by keeping the pace low. But when it was his turn, their colourful colleague blew them away and they spent the the rest of the session chasing him. They didnt need to worry. His natural fitness levels could absorb time away from training. The support structures around him were strong. He was motivated by winning and coach Taylor understood the concept of not everyone being the same. You cant put a saddle on a mustang, Chuck Daly once said. Welcome the concept of the maverick. For the manager in team sports, it can be easy to pigeon hole everyone into the same category. That way, you have a simple team ethos andsomeone steps out of line, the pre-written rules leave the decision to omit someone easy. “At the start of the year, everyone knew the story,” would be the narrative. But not everyone is the same. Why should they be  The challenge is how to manage on a dferent scale. Some need a kick up the ass, some need an arm around the shoulder. But in a team scenario, not everybody fits. If someone is too disruptive, has nothing to offer the team and wont meet the coaches rules somewhere in the middle – then cutting them loose is the only option. I remember chatting to former Dungiven manager Jim McGroarty a few weeks ago. He uttered a statement along the lines of...anyone can throw down a load of cones and copy drills off their phone and call themselves a coach, but management is about so much more. He is so right. Having not covered a game of sport since St Pius won their MacLarnon semi-final, watching sport on television has been filling the gap. It has also led to a period of reflection. If we are lucky enough to get through all this, sport should resume in a better place –team managers have also used their time to reflect and not just find a better way of playing  or  men behind the ball. Gerry McElhinney waltzing through the heart of the Dublin midfield, Maradona tearing strips of the England defence in  and Michael Jordan dunking shots with his back to the basket - these are the people who build a legacy. They are players who will inspire and –managed properly - are the dference between a team being average and great. Without them, sport is dull. These are the players teams need to revolve around. Development should not be about seeing how many athletes you can find that can handpass with perfection and follow out orders. Anyone could do that. Dennis Rodman and the mavericks need to meet the team ethos halfway down the path. If they dont, then you can say you tried and agree to go your separate ways. If they understand the word compromise, then so too should the manager. If they cant dferentiate between their ego with the ego of others, they shouldnt be managing.

Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice. Still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that theyre gone.”  - Morgan Freeman as Red in the Shawshank Redemption Netflix delivered a gem to the sporting fraternity recently in the form of The Last Dance, a behind the scenes documentary following the Chicago Bulls during their six NBA titles in eight seasons during the s. It was casual watching and not needing much concentration, but interesting on a range of dferent levels. googletag.cmd.push The footage of Michael Jordan was just enthralling. His demand for the highest of standards turned around the fortunes of the underperforming Bulls. His brilliance gave him locker room clout beyond his newcomer status. His power to jump and score was sizzling. When he leapt off the court, he was a genius. The Bulls went from winning just over a third of their games to pushing for glory and he was named as Rookie of the Year in his first season. As the series began to pan out, it was centred around three main players and their personalities – Jordan, Scottie Pippen and later Dennis Rodman. googletag.cmd.push Tangled in the storyline was Scottie being grossly underpaid for what he was offering the team. It led to a fallout with the franchise General Manager Jerry Krause. One glance at Dennis Rodman made me think more about team dynamics. He is the ultimate maverick. He came from a broken home but somehow escaped the drug culture that passed by in front of his eyes. The day he lted a basketball saved him. A family friend saw enough to tip off a local school basketball coach and it was his passport to college and eventually the Detroit Pistons. The Pistons were labelled the bad-boys of the NBA. They got into teams faces and under their skins and they developed nasty rivalry with the Bulls. Rodman morphed into one of their most influential players and built up a terric relationship with coach Chuck Daly. So much so, than when Daly – a father figure almost – resigned, Dennis went off the rails. He was a troubled inidual and demanded a transfer. He also dated music star Madonna who convinced him that he needed to express himself and be who he wanted to be and not how others wanted him to fit. HUNCH After a spell with the San Antonio Spurs, Rodman moved on to the Bulls. It was a gamble. The club hierarchy went on a hunch that Dennis would be safe due to the presence of Jordan and Pippen and how they would steer and inspire him. The other factor was the most important – coach Phil Jackson. They knew he could handle him. A glance at Rodman and he is not your everyday player. Tattoos, jewellery all over his face and a hairstyle that changes day on day. Even on one occasion, he had bleached all through his hair, to mark his teammatesto the court from injury. Rodman made me think of that line from the Shawshank Redemption. The one Red mutters when the innocent Andy is on the the brink of escape – some birds are too beautul to cage. And Rodman knew his worth. “Youve got the great Michael Jordan, the great Scottie Pippen and the greatPhil Jackson...you take me away from this team...do they still win the championship  I dont think so,” was one of his comments during the documentary. Everybody  knew it too. In  when the Bulls were chasing their sixth title, Rodman requested some leave time in mid-season and was granted  hours. As Jordan expected, Dennis went AWOL in Las Vegas and they had to go to get him back. Onto training, Jackson put the Bulls through their paces to blow the black smoke out of Rodmans system from his time off the rails. The old fashioned back to the front runs. During laps the player at the back had to sprint to the front, all the way around the court. The GAA pre-season drill from hell. The Bulls players plotted to take it easy on Rodman -and themselves – by keeping the pace low. But when it was his turn, their colourful colleague blew them away and they spent the the rest of the session chasing him. They didnt need to worry. His natural fitness levels could absorb time away from training. The support structures around him were strong. He was motivated by winning and coach Taylor understood the concept of not everyone being the same. You cant put a saddle on a mustang, Chuck Daly once said. Welcome the concept of the maverick. For the manager in team sports, it can be easy to pigeon hole everyone into the same category. That way, you have a simple team ethos andsomeone steps out of line, the pre-written rules leave the decision to omit someone easy. “At the start of the year, everyone knew the story,” would be the narrative. But not everyone is the same. Why should they be  The challenge is how to manage on a dferent scale. Some need a kick up the ass, some need an arm around the shoulder. But in a team scenario, not everybody fits. If someone is too disruptive, has nothing to offer the team and wont meet the coaches rules somewhere in the middle – then cutting them loose is the only option. I remember chatting to former Dungiven manager Jim McGroarty a few weeks ago. He uttered a statement along the lines of...anyone can throw down a load of cones and copy drills off their phone and call themselves a coach, but management is about so much more. He is so right. Having not covered a game of sport since St Pius won their MacLarnon semi-final, watching sport on television has been filling the gap. It has also led to a period of reflection. If we are lucky enough to get through all this, sport should resume in a better place –team managers have also used their time to reflect and not just find a better way of playing  or  men behind the ball. Gerry McElhinney waltzing through the heart of the Dublin midfield, Maradona tearing strips of the England defence in  and Michael Jordan dunking shots with his back to the basket - these are the people who build a legacy. They are players who will inspire and –managed properly - are the dference between a team being average and great. Without them, sport is dull. These are the players teams need to revolve around. Development should not be about seeing how many athletes you can find that can handpass with perfection and follow out orders. Anyone could do that. Dennis Rodman and the mavericks need to meet the team ethos halfway down the path. If they dont, then you can say you tried and agree to go your separate ways. If they understand the word compromise, then so too should the manager. If they cant dferentiate between their ego with the ego of others, they shouldnt be managing.

Dermot Morrow will taking part in Australia, Lee Kennedy in Canada, Rory McEldowney in New York and Jenni Ross-Boyle was promoting it from outside Buckingham Palace.All runners will be following routes as close to their homes as possible to follow the social distancing guidelines. The times and distances are logged and passed back to Karen and Brian Oacuteg for totting up the progress.“Yeah, everyone is involved now, but it is only the senior teams who are running through the night, we want to keep it as safe as possible. Everyone  will be running from .am and finishing up around .pm,” Karen continues.At the time of publication, the club had raised pound,.“We have been doing very well. At the start, we have set the target of two grand and weve more than doubled that with a week to go.”Looking ahead to this weekend, the club is appealing to as many as possible to get involved.“Its a case of the more the merrier between the hours of am to pm, you dont have to be from Kilrea –you want to run on behalf of someone who died from any chest, heart and stroke related issues. If you dont want to run, you can walk or jog,” Karen concluded.All the proceeds are going towards the NI Chest, Heart and Stroke, a cause in the clubs thoughts.Last June, they lost U manager Brian Calvert to a sudden heart attack and also prominent clubman Tommy Donaghy recently passed away. googletag.cmd.push All donations, no matter how small are greatly appreciated.

Checklist to help fight cyber fraud The Government has a checklist to help people protect themselves from cyber fraud: Take a breath - a moment - before you part with money or personal information. It sounds simple, but this alone could end up preventing fraud from taking place. Ensure you are using the latest software, apps and operating systems on your phones, tablets and laptops and update them regularly. Andyou get an unexpected or suspicious email or text message, don’t click on the attachment or message. Don’t be afraid to challenge messages and messengers. It’s okay to refuse or ignore requests for your money or detailsyou are suspicious - only criminals will try to rush or panic you. The police and banks will never ask you to withdraw money or transfer it to a dferent account. Neither will they ask you to reveal your full banking password or PIN. You can check that requests are genuine by using a known number or email address to contact organisations directly. Andyou think you have fallen victim to a scam, then contact your bank immediately and report it to Action Fraud. You can report suspicious texts by forwarding the original message to , which spells SPAM on your keypad. SHARE CAUTION Be careful what you share, because things are not always what they seem online. Protect yourself and your family from misinformation and fraud by taking care when online, and use the website www.sharechecklist.gov.uk If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This follows commitments made by ministers over the weekend that the government will meet with the two representativebodies for publicans over course of the coming week.As part of their discussions with the government, the two organisations will be pressing for pubs to reopen at the same time and on the same basis as cafes and restaurants. Recognising the challenge of maintaining social distancing in a hospitality environment, the organisations will also be putting forward radical changes to the normal operations of barsin order to protect public health.These measures include: googletag.cmd.push • Bars will become dispense bars only with no sitting, standing, ordering, payment or drinking at the bar allowed. • Table service will be a requirement with pubs only serving customers seated at tables. • The numbers on the premises would be confined to no more than  per every  square metres. • A maximum of  people would be permitted at any one table. • Customers will be required to use hand sanitiser upon entry. • All customers must remain seated. • Staff will be fully trained in the new procedures. They will also be asked to maintain a safe distance from customers when taking orders and to wash their hands thoroughlyevery  minutes. googletag.cmd.push • The utilisation of outdoor spaces to enhance social distancing. • Procedures implemented to ensure safe use of toilet facilities, which may include limits on the numbers using toilets at any one time. • No live music or DJs. Speaking about the proposed measures, Donall O’Keeffe, Chief Executive of the LVA said, “We fully respect the need to continue to protect the public health. We have repeatedlyproven this commitment, not least in the fact that our sector was the first to close across the country. We also believe thatother venues who serve food and alcohol are allowed toreopen in Phase , then pubs should be granted the same opportunity to trade. We don’t believe it is in any way appropriate that the Government should apply one rule for somehospitality businesses and another rule for others.“We are making a series of radical proposals to how bars should operate for the reopening scenario. Trading will be extremely dficult under these circumstances. There is no doubtthat the pub experience as we know it will have to change dramatically. Many pubs may choose not to reopen as it simply won’t be financially viable under these conditions.However, for those who want to trade, these measures will have the essential impact of protecting the health and wellbeing of staff and customers alike,” Mr. O’Keeffe said.

Plans have been put forward to construct the new footbridge as part of a proposal to extend Derrys popular quayside walk and cycle path. Derry City and Strabane District Council has applied for planning permission to build the footbridge across an inlet close to the Fort George site. This would allow the quayside walkway to be extended into the Bay Road area. There are also plans to create a new three-metre wide cycle walking path along Bay Road to link in to the Bay Road Park. Derrys quay has been revitalised in recent years and the latest proposal looks set to continue the regeneration of the riverside area. googletag.cmd.push The plans for the new footbridge and walkway are now being considered by the local councils planning department. Meanwhile, a new cycling champion role has been created to encourage more people to get on their bikes in Derry. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon this week announced a new walking and cycling champion with a focus on transforming communities and developing creative solutions to support a new way of living during and post COVID-. “Our champion will ensure that we deliver our commitment to increase the percentage of journeys made by walking and cycling. Inspiring our communities, restructuring our spaces, changing forever the way we live – and changing it for the better,” said the Minister. googletag.cmd.push “I want to increase the space available for people who want to walk and cycle by extending pavements, pedestrianising streetsand introducing pop up cycle lanes. I have already identied someparts ofBelfast City Centre and Derry city that can betransformed in this wayand I intend to work with councils to identy more areas across the North as a matter of urgency. Changing how we use our spaces will transform communities right across Northern Ireland – creatively change lives – enable social distancing and encourage health and mental wellbeing. “Thisenvironmental and public healthwork will be done on a collaborative basis, with an action group, formed from both within and outside government. I also want to work in collaboration with communities, including identying and creating ‘Quiet Streets’ where pedestrians, cyclists and play have priority and motor vehicles are guests,” added Ms Mallon. “As the Executive looks this week to review thelockdown – we all need to be looking ahead – out of the darkness of this pandemic and into a better world that we need to build for ourselves. Greener, cleaner, healthier and happier people and places must be our aim as we learn to live with this new normal during and after Covid-.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Over the last month, hundreds of messages of support have flooded into local SuperValu and Centra stores, as customers pay tribute to the huge efforts local retailers have been making to keep food on people’s tables right across Northern Ireland. These heart-warming messages have lted the spirts of hardworking local retailers and their teams, as they work tirelessly to keep shelves stocked and queues moving. Now, SuperValu and Centra are planning to pay this positivity back. The retail brands are asking customers in Derry to nominate their local store hero – the people that are going above and beyond to help their local communities during the Covid- pandemic. googletag.cmd.push For every nomination, SuperValu and Centra will donate pound to their long-standing charity partner, Action Cancer. With fundraising events cancelled and Action Cancer retail shops closed as a result of the Covid- Pandemic, the charity needs to raise vital funds, so it can provide le-saving cancer prevention, detection and support services to those most in need as soon as services can get back up and running.  Launching the new initiative, Desi Derby, Marketing Director for SuperValu and Centra in NI said: “Our frontline workers are going above and beyond and doing a fantastic job – making sure shelves are stocked, delivering to those in need and ensuring customers stay safe when in store. googletag.cmd.push We have been overwhelmed by the dferent messages of thanks and appreciation that have come in from our customers whether on social media or via our customer services team and so we wanted to recognise this in the first instance. “Those same frontline colleagues also work tirelessly every year to raise money for Action Cancer and asked how we could do more when social distancing prevents the normal fundraisers such as in-store cycles and coffee mornings. So, we decided to bring the recognition of our colleagues and our commitment to support our charity partner together. We are now asking customers to take the time to nominate the person in your local store that has made a real dference. Andat this time of crisis, when our charity partner Action Cancer is seeing a substantial drop in income, being able to help support them too is extremely important to us.” People can nominate their local store hero on the SuperValu or Centra Facebook page or by emailingsupervalu.localhero@musgrave.ieor centra.localhero@musgrave.ie.

At present, there are six people being treated at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry after testing positive for the disease. Geraldine McKay, the Western Trusts Director of Acute Hospitals, said that the number of COVID- patients at Altnagelvin was very reduced in comparison to what they have been. There have been  deaths from COVID- in recent months in the Western Trusts two acute hospitals at Altnagelvin and the South West hospital in Enniskillen. There have been further deaths in local care homes but a breakdown of deaths in inidual care homes has not been made public. googletag.cmd.push The Western Trust said that there had been COVID- outbreaks in  care homes in the Trust area. An outbreak is defined as two or more cases. Ms McKay said the lower than anticipated number of cases and deaths locally was due to the co-operation of the public and the magnicent work of healthcare staff. As part of the preparations for the expected rise in COVID- cases, the number of intensive care beds at Altnagelvin Hospital had been increased from  to . However, Ms McKay said the intensive care unit never had to work at full capacity over the recent period. googletag.cmd.push She said that the number of people attending Altnagelvins emergency department had decreased by almost % over recent months after people were asked to stay away from the hospital as much as possible to allow staff to cope with the COVID- situation. Ms McKay praised the public for their support for the health service and highlighted how well people locally had taken on board the message to stay at home and maintain social distancing when out in public. She said this had played a vital role in keeping the number of COVID- cases and deaths lower than had been anticipated. People have really done what we asked of them, she said. Ms McKay said the Trust was now looking at how to manage the new normal for hospital services, taking into consideration issues such as social distancing in waiting areas and the use of personal protection equipment for staff.

Robert Fullerton, who is , bought the pound ‘Treasure Bingo’ Scratchcard at his local Vivoxtra store whilst shopping for some essential grocery items on May . Little did Robert know that later the same evening he would discover he’d won an amount , times greater than the price of the scratchcard! The incredible news comes as an amazing boost for Robert and his we Susanas both had been recently furloughed from the company they work for as a result of the COVID- pandemic. googletag.cmd.push Robert works as a spray painter and Susan as a machine operator for a leading local kitchen supplier and, like many across the country, have been furloughed for the past five weeks as part of the Government’s job retention scheme. Robert explained how his le-changing win came about. “I was out doing an essential grocery shop and had a scratchcard in my pocket with a pound win on it. So while I was paying for the groceries, I exchanged it for another similar National Lottery Scratchcard, and bought an extra one for good measure. “I brought the two scratchcards home and played them that night. I didn’t win anything on the first scratchcard and gave it to Susan to check, while I was scratching the second card,” he continued. googletag.cmd.push “Half-way through, it was already showing that I’d won pound, and I started physically shaking. I was thinking to myself, ‘that’s not right’ and had to get up and go outside for some fresh air. “I showed the scratchcard to Susan and took a photo that I sent to my mum and sister – both of whom agreed that I wasn’t seeing things and that, as far as they could see, I’d won three hundred grand! “After a restless night, with little or no sleep, I called The National Lottery the following morning. They asked for some details and then, I’ll never forget, the lady on the phone said… ‘Congratulations, you have won pound,’! “My reply was ‘you what ’ My heart felt like it was going to burst out of my chest. In fact, I still can’t believe it. It’s like a dream come true, especially in these uncertain times when we’re stuck at home and don’t really know how our jobs will be affected by this coronavirus pandemic.” Despite his big win, Robert hopes to get back to work as soon as possible, saying that he loves his job and the ‘banter’ with his workmates. Robert bought the winning National Lottery Treasure Bingo Scratchcard from the Vivoxtra store on Magherafelt Road in Castledawson.

Last week, the Northern Ireland Executive announced it would match fund the British government’s investment therefore boosting the city region’s overall financial package to poundm. With additional funds leveraged from City Deal partners such as Ulster University and the private sector, it is anticipated that figure will rise to around poundm. Details of specic projects have been sparse, but it is known that Ulster University will receive at least poundm for centres in personalised medicine, data analytics, robotics and automation and a graduate entry medical school. googletag.cmd.push Now, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council has revealed that a riverfront and Foyle Street regeneration project will receive approximately poundm-poundm of the money. It is at a very early stage of concept design and as such, a budget for it can only be estimated. A council spokesperson said: “This project envisages the complete reconstruction of Queen’s Quay, the remodelling of Harbour Square and major environmental improvement works to Foyle Street and Foyle Embankment.” Other key projects fall under tourism, the combined funding earmarked for these plans at this stage is poundm-poundm. Although some of the tourism projects - such as the DNA Maritime experience in Ebrington - are much further advanced, other complementary tourism projects are again currently at concept stage only. googletag.cmd.push The council spokesperson added: “With regard to the riverfront and tourism projects, confirmation of the match funding for the Inclusive Future Fund has enabled us to progress with Strategic Outline Business Cases for the tourism and riverfront regeneration projects. “Council will continue over the coming weeks and months to progress with project planning and developing these business cases and engage with government and all stakeholders to understand the scale of resources and how we put them in place to facilitate the next stage of this exciting piece of work.” In addition to the riverfront and Foyle Street regeneration proposals, a council spokesperson also highlighted the siting of the medical school and future planned university expansion along the Quay. Initially, that will be limited to a site adjacent to the current city council offices but ultimately could include the city council offices with council relocating to the former City Hotel site on Foyle Street, adjacent to the Guildhall. Costs for all projects will y and be adjusted as business cases are developed and designs subsequently advanced and progressed. The council spokesperson added: “Again, as previously stated all of these plans are currently at concept stage only and are subject to business case development, affordability and approvals. “This very signicant and ambitious combined suite of integrated projects, together with the development of the centres of innovation in data analytics, robotics and automation and personalised medicine will transform the riverfront city centre, will act as a catalyst for further development and regeneration and will be a major investment in the health and well-being of our citizens.” Last week, the Derry News also revealed additional plans to regenerate Derrys quayside area. Plans have been put forward to construct a new footbridge as part of a proposal to extend the popular walk and cycle path. Derry City and Strabane District Council has applied for planning permission to build the footbridge across an inlet close to the Fort George site. This would allow the quayside walkway to be extended into the Bay Road area. There are also plans to create a new three-metre wide cycle walking path along Bay Road to link in to the Bay Road Park. Derrys quay has been revitalised in recent years and the latest proposals looks set to continue the regeneration of the riverside area. The plans for the new footbridge and walkway are now being considered by the local councils planning department.

The monthly Mayors tea dances at the Guildhall have been a highlight of their social calendar for many people in recent years.

Mayor, Michaela Boyle, and her team are linking up with the Mark Patterson Show on Radio Foyle to create a special live virtual tea dance from pm to pm. googletag.cmd.push The show will feature music from local band Midnight Sun. Derry City and Strabane District Council will be providing a digital archive of some fascinating pieces from the Tower Museums Showbands Exhibition featuring old photos and stories from back in the day.

Councillor Boyle said she was really looking forward to catching up with some of theteadanceregulars. Theteadancesare one of my favourite events and they have a dedicated following of lively members of the older generation who would put us all to shame with their energy and vitality. googletag.cmd.push This is a very dficult time for everyone – particularly older citizens – many of whom will be shielding at home, and perhaps feeling more isolated from family and friends.

Like all of us, hersquos patiently waiting for when thingsto normal and travel is possible again.ldquoI definitely havenrsquot spent more than at couple of weeks at home since  when my father George died, explains Tim. ldquoItrsquos a real shame that I canlsquot really enjoy everything that Co Down has to offer, but at least home is a good spot. Myself and my mother enjoy going out for a walk along the Quoile river every now and then.The third of four children, Tim has an older sister, Heather, and two brothers, Michael and Pat. Their late father was a highly respected lawyer, who became a county court judge.Ash, the band Tim founded in  at the age of  with fellow Down High School students Mark Hamilton, also from Downpatrick, and Rick McMurray, from Killyleagh, exploded on to the Britpop scene in the mid-s. Known as one of the softer alternative rockpop bands, Ash put Downpatrick well and truly on the music map. Along with the success of the Papenfus brothers, Kenneth and Carl, with their band Relish, and local rockers, The Answer, it was a golden age for music for the town and district.Tim and the band have been recording and touring ever since, having recently embarked on a European tour to support their new specially compiled album, Best of Teenage Wildle ndash  years of Ash. Coming in a combination of vinyl, a special  CD with an  rare track CD, Teenage Wildle has charted well so far, coming top in both the UK and Irish Independent Albums chart and th in the UK Album chart.When President Donald Trump closed the US airports in March, it could not have come at a worst time for the band in promotional terms.Tim explained: ldquoWe were in the middle of European tour in February and everything was just gradually grinding to a standstill. At that time, I did thinkI didnrsquot leave for New York soon there was a chance that I wouldnrsquot get back for two to three months.ldquoBut our UK dates were the following week and they still hadnlsquot been cancelled. I felt that I didnrsquot have a choice so we stayed and we spent three days driving to Hamburg to a gig which got cancelled on the day. We travelled back to the UK and then the tour dates got cancelled the day before the first show was meant to have been held. It was too late for me at that point to get back to the US so I came back to Northern Ireland and stayed at my sisterrsquos place for a week before I went to Downpatrick.While he is enjoying his downtime in Downpatrick, rehoning lyrics to songs he first started several years ago, Tim is naturally concerned about when andhe will get back to New York.ldquoIrsquom technically a temporary resident so Irsquom worried about getting back to the US as Irsquom not a citizen or permanent resident. I was planning to move to London in July as we have a recording studio there with a lease ending soon and we need to move equipment out over the next few months. Thatrsquos all a big question mark now. Irsquove been in New York for  years and would like a chance to say goodbye to everyone.Although the change of pace is dferent at home compared to New York, both are close to Timrsquos heart.ldquoThe number one thing about New York that I love are the people. Itrsquos such an amazing mixof cultures. It has so much energy to the place. The pace is really fast, itrsquos endlessly interesting, he said.ldquoBut Irsquove always been comfortable about coming back to Northern Ireland. We are surrounded by woodland and the Quoile river. When the sun shines, therersquos nowhere better in the world. I like going between the two extremes, itrsquos a really good place to be writing, reading and walking around.Tim recently connected with the world of music globally when he broadcast a live performance from his Downpatrick home to raise money for struggling musicians and artists impacted by the coronavirus lockdown. Organised by the Performing Rights Society , which pays royalties to members when their work is performed in whatever , Tim was one of  big names who took part.He started off with a rendition of his hit, Girl From Mars, performed with an acoustic guitar, and played Shining Light, which he won an Ivor Novello award in  for Best Contemporary Pop Song, finishing off with Teenage Kicks by Derry band The Undertones.ldquoThat felt really good and I felt really connected it was good seeing all the comments coming up, said Tim. ldquoBut to be honest, it was nerve-wrecking doing a broadcast from home as the internet is not too good here. Normally on stage you would have fears of your equipment failing but I was just thinking I hope that this internet does not cut out. If the phone rings the home, the internet cuts out. I was praying that no one would ring my mum in the middle of it.ldquoIt just dawned on me while I was singing Shining Light that I had written it in the same room where I was broadcasting from. Irsquove written a lot of good songs in that room.He joked at how long it normally takes him to release new music and how he is still working on songs he wrote several years ago.ldquoThe guys and I have been chatting a lot still and Irsquove been sending them song ideas and discussing things but I really wish we could get into a rehearsal room and jam through the stuff. Maybe we will get to do that in a few weeksrsquo time.ldquoItrsquos going to be interesting to see what new music comes out from artists after the lockdown but Irsquom always on a bit of a lag with new stuff as by the time Irsquove written a new song and wersquore recorded it, itrsquos three years later. The good thing about this time is that itrsquos given me an opportunity to finish a lot of lyrics where I just didnrsquot have time before. Irsquom wrapping up a lot of songs that I started in , so expect our coronavirus album in .Hersquos disappointed, as are local fans, that the bandrsquos planned Belfast gig has had to be postponed until at least the autumn.Best of Teenage Wildle is available now for streaming on ious s and to purchase from Ashrsquos official website store https:store.ash-official .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Ballycran.jpg","title":"Ballycran members sewing scrubs for frontline workers  ","story":"SCRUBS made by a group of women from St Josephrsquos GAA Club in Ballycran are now being worn in the Belfast Nightingale Hospital and several local nursing homes and medical centres.The colourful easy wash garments are brightening up NHS nurses and care workers as they look after patients and residents during the coronavirus lockdown.Some lucky frontline staff are wearing Manchester United scrubs or Paws Patrol made from themed duvets.Mrs Marguerite Fowler, sister of club chairperson Shane Gilmore, is co-ordinating the cross-community effort.The core group of sewers are Pamela McGourty, Brenda Coyle, Madeline Bell, Ann Moan, Anne OrsquoBrien, Madeline Branf, Caitlin Savage, Fiona Gilmore and Geraldine McGrattan. However, more sewers are coming on to help out as word spreads about the initiative.The club put out a call for people to help with the sewing and donations of material and were overwhelmed with the response.Mrs Fowler explained that the group came about after she was approached privately by some peopleshe knew anyone who could provide scrubs.ldquoWe started at the beginning of the month and so far we have made scrubs for four nursing homes, including Barrhall Residential Home in Portaferry, and supplied scrubs to Loughview Medical Centre in Kircubbin and Ballywalter Health Centre.ldquoWe have also supplied scrubs to nurses at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast and the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald as well to nurses in the Nightingale Hospital in Belfast City Tower Block through my sister-in-lawrsquos niece who is a nurse. We are now filling orders from Positive Futures, a group who visit people with learning disabilities who vulnerable, in their own homes and had absolutely no protective gear. They find scrubs are so much easier to wash and dry than their own clothes.She said that while the GAA club put the initial call out for help and donations of material, it was very much a community effort.GAA clubs in Portaferry and Ballygalget have also donated duvets sheets and other items, already washed and ready to sew.ldquoWe are also very excited about a delivery of brand new fabric, funded by a grant negotiated by Iain Bell from Kircubbin and District Community Association and we thank him for his generous help.Scrubs provided are free of charge, but the group do like to see photographs of staff wearing them afterwards.Mrs Fowler said the group are able to take requests for specic sizes which might otherwise be dficult to get and they can be contacted via the Ballycran Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Community.jpg","title":"Community allotment group looking for new volunteers  ","story":"TUCKED away in a corner of the New Model Farm housing estate in Downpatrick is an oasis of calm amidst the turmoil of the coronavirus pandemic.Downpatrick Community Allotments has gone from strength to strength since its launch a number of years ago and there is also a healthy and particularly thriving apiary.With so many people confined to home as part of the the governmentrsquos lockdown directive, the group behind the allotments is keen to recruit new volunteers to help with their upkeep.Those responsible for the allotments are hoping that people will come forward to get involved in and enjoy the many benefits of working on the plots, especially at a time when the focus is very much on looking after your mental health.That the allotments can continue to operate is due to the fact the strict regulations in relation to social distancing are rigorously enforced, with the focus not just on the health of the plants and vegetables being grown, but also of all those tilling the land.Indeed, the community allotments initiative is a success story which continues to blossom and has transformed what was once an area of wasteland into a thriving hub which is also making a positive contribution to the environment and the lives of those who use it.Developed by the Downpatrick Community Collective mdash an umbrella group for a number of community groups across the town mdash the allotments have become a blooming success in more ways than one thanks to the horticulture skills of the volunteers who have learnt new skills and gained confidence as a result.A vibrant and growing community initiative has firmly embedded itself in this part of Downpatrick and continues to flourish, thanks to the hard work and dedication of the volunteers. Only last month, all the hanging baskets produced at the New Model Farm site sold out.Locate at the site are two poly tunnels, flower beds and vegetable patches cocooned into a corner of the housing estate, with the apiary also a big hit with beekeepers who have honed their skills with the help of the Killinchy Beekeepers.Allotment holders and groups using the site regularly produce an array of fresh vegetables, flowers and bedding plants, while the beekeepers are producing their own delicious honey which is in its natural state with no additives.Sean Clarke, who is the chairman of Downpatrick Community Allotments, says there is nothing like working in the great outdoors, filling your lungs with fresh air and clearing your mind.ldquoAll our plots are currently taken but we are looking for new volunteers, he explained.ldquoWhen one of our plots does become available, it is snapped up immediately. Some of the townrsquos residentsrsquo groups have taken plots and we are delighted to have a mix of all abilities working at the site.ldquoThere is great camaraderie and we have our very own gardening guru mdash Stephen Harris.ldquoHe is brilliant to have around the place and has an encyclopaedic knowledge of gardening which is being passed on to the volunteers. Stephen once had his own landscaping business and is more than happy to share is extensive knowledge with us.Downpatrick Community Allotments now has its own Facebook page packed with photos and information about what is happening at the New Model Farm site with the social media page helping generate wide interest in what is going on there.ldquoMany people have come along to learn gardening skills including seed planting, propagation and how to fill hanging baskets and it is clear to see their enthusiasm. It is great to be outdoors and enjoying the benefits of physical exercise and fresh air, Sean continued, revealing that within three days of all the hanging baskets produced going on sale they sold out.Given the focus on greater public health awareness as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, all the equipment at the allotments is sanitised before and after use and social distancing regulations are enforced across the site, both at the allotments, in the poly tunnels and apiary.ldquoEveryone is always two metres apart and due to the size of the allotments, three people can work comfortably at the same time, while adhering to the social distancing guidelines.Sean is a great believer in how working at the Model Farm site is good for mental health and said there are many studies which back up his assertion.ldquoPeople really get a lot out of seeing the flowers and vegetables they plant growing and there is always a great buzz about the place. The allotments can certainly help people destress, especially in the current climate.It was planned to bring along a chef to the allotments so the volunteers can learn ious ways they can cook their fresh vegetables and while this has had to be put on hold, it is something Sean is keen to see happening when the pandemic is brought under control and the current lockdown regulations are relaxed.He added: ldquoWe are hoping that we may be able get a chef in around September, but that will depend on the current restrictions being eased.For further information on Downpatrick Community Allotments pay a visit to the grouprsquos Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Council.jpg","title":"Council has no plans to lay off current staff  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has this week insisted that it has no current plans to lay off staff.The confirmation comes after Antrim and Newtownabbey Council confirmed last week that it was planning to make a number of employees redundant, with  jobs affected.However, officials subsequently deferred a decision on  positions, but  agency staff are to be let go due to funding pressures during the coronavirus pandemic.Defending its decision to cut jobs, the council said it had faced an ldquounprecedented financial challenge due to signicantly reduced revenues following the closure of public facilities.It also confirmed there has been ldquono confirmation of any additional funding being provided to councils from government and the UK-wide furlough scheme is not expected to be used by local authorities.While the planned job losses are subject to negotiations with trade unions, Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey made it clear that she will not support actions of councilsthey do not respect and protect workersrsquo rights.The minister said that each of Northern Irelandrsquos  councils mdash including Newry, Mourne and Down.ldquoI call on councils and other employers to do all in their power to safeguard jobs so that when the current restrictions are lted, those very workers can contribute to the economic recovery that we will so badly need, she remarked.The Northern Ireland Local Government Associationmdash the umbrella body for the provincersquos  councils mdash said councils were facing ldquoshort and long-term financial pressures like never before.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that no decision has been taken in relation to reducing staff number ldquoat this time.Former NILGA president and Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos announcement.ldquoThese are unprecedented times and the local authority has lost a signicant amount of income given the closure of leisure and community facilities across the district, he said.ldquoVarious staff have been redeployed across the organisation and at these terribly dficult times, they are working to maintain services with others playing key roles in helping to deliver food packages to residents across the district.Cllr Curran said he would not want to see anyone losing their job and hopes the local council will continue to work hard to make sure this does happen anywhere within the organisation.ldquoNo one could have predicted the situation we now find ourselves in, he continued. ldquoItrsquos important that the public plays its part, stays at homeit all possible and when out, exercise social distancing to help protect the HNS and save lives.ldquoMany people have lost their jobs through no fault of their own and I hope that in the not too distant future, lockdown measures will start to be eased to help rebuild the local economy and people can get back to work.He added: ldquoThis will not happen overnight, but the more we obey public health advice now, the sooner the lockdown can be eased..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Evan.jpg","title":"Evan and mum raising dough for charity during virus lockdown  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE woman and her little son have been busy baking tasty treats on social media to help raise money for a local mental health charity since the lockdown began.When Pauline Smyth was forced to close the doors of the Blue Bay Cafe in Dundrum due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus, she and two year-old Evan took to baking some of their favourite recipes.For almost four weeks, the pair have stirred, sted and simmered their way through a mountain of ingredients, making everything from pizza pin wheels to Portuguese custard tarts and posting snap shots of their combined efforts on the Blue Bay Cafe  Bakery Facebook page, along with the recipes.Pauline says Evan loves to help out, especially when it comes to making doughnuts.

the town.Superintendent Brendan McGuigan has appealed to local people not to react to rumour or innuendo and to ensure common-sense prevails at all times.The police chiefrsquos comments come after a second week of serious assaults which left one local man requiring hospital treatment for sustained severe head injuries, inflicted during a vicious attack at the Bishopsbrae area.Mr McGuigan has also highlighted an incident when a family were forced to flee their Leaside Gardens home in the Flying Horse estate after a malicious blaze.In addition, two other young men were bundled into a car and taken to the Steamboat Quay area at the Quoile River where they were assaulted.Two weeks ago, an ongoing feud between two Downpatrick families was blamed for a shooting incident at the Vianstown Park area in the town and an assault on a woman in Church Street.Mr McGuigan says he is concerned at the number of recent events, which include a local family having to be rehoused in emergency accommodation, and claims they paint a very wrong picture of the county town.The police chief said the sequence of recent events does nothing to enhance Downpatrickrsquos reputation and said people who live in a civilised community must accept the rule oflaw.DUNDRUM ndash A Dundrum man confronted a skinhead burglar in his home during the early hours of Monday morning and forced him to flee the Church Avenue house.The owner was asleep at am when he was disturbed by the intruder whom he chased out of his home.But the burglar, who is described as five foot  inches tall and believed to have

Proceeds of this yearrsquos event will be donated to the Northern Ireland Hospice and Marie Curie Cancer Care.Jenny Adams, the showrsquos joint secretary, says the commemorative booklet is a good account of how the show has evolved over the years.ldquoIt is certainly interesting to see the role it originally played in improving the standard of farming in the Killyleagh, Killinchy, Kilmood and Tullynahill areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Collins.jpg","title":"Goalkeeper Collins selects his all time greatest Down team  ","story":"THE early s saw ato the glory days for Down. The county was a footballing powerhouse once more, landing two All-Ireland titles in the space of three years and the players secured their place in GAA folklore.An immovable force was their goalkeeper Neil Collins. He thwarted Meath in the  and in  memorably saved a penalty from Dublin danger man Charlie Coleman.Now a youthful , Neil began his football career with Ballymartin and then with Drumaness. But he is best known for his association with Carryduff. He broke into the Down senior  in  and remained in the squad for ten years.He remained a dedicated servant of Down long after his playing career ended. He managed the county U- team for three years, was goalkeeping coach of the senior team for six years and also a selector for three years when the team was managed by his All-Ireland-winning colleague, the late and much missed Eamonn Burns.Neil hasnrsquot included himself in his  greatest Down players, but for the others donrsquot look much further than his team-mates from the early Nineties.ldquoThese were the players I grew up with, so I have to stick with them. Irsquom too young to remember the Sixties, he says.ldquoI had a great time with Down. Obviously the highlights were winning the two All-Irelandrsquos, but I have wonderful memories of the people I played with and all the friendships.ldquoThanks to WhatsApp I am in contact with them every day. We had the th reunion of the  team in Dublin last year and we also got together to remember the th anniversary of the Loughinisland tragedy.ldquoThey are a great bunch of lads, but you canrsquot put a foot wrong, otherwise you would be pulled up very quickly. Pat DonnanPat was goalkeeper for the Down minors which won the All-Ireland title in  and was goalkeeper for the senior team for many years. He was a great keeper and became a mentor to me. He took me under his wing and made me a better player. He was also generous with time and advice. A great goalkeeper and an even greater man. Miceal MagillThis is the most dficult pick. It was between Miceal and Brendan McKernan, but I have gone for Miceal, largely because of his performance in the  final which won him the Ulster Bank Man of the Match award. He had a fantastic game and never let Charlie Redmond get away from him. He was always comfortable with the ball and could read a game well. Conor DeeganConor was a tremendous athlete and he could take on the oppositionrsquos biggest players. He always seemed to get on top of his opponents and I never once saw him roasted. He had terric hands and he could read a game as well as anyone. He always encouraged those around him. He was a true team player. Paul HigginsPaul was as hard as nails and he was also the quickest player in the squad, even faster than Mickey Linden. He dominated and bullied his opponents and he had great strength of character. John KellyMy Carryduff clubmate and a ruthless, nasty player in the best possible way. He was the sort of player nobody wanted to mark, whether in a match or in training. He would put his head where others feared to put their feet. Barry BreenAnother double All-Ireland winner. I first played with him at the Red High. Barry always seemed to have time on the ball. He played at a dferent level to everyone . What set him apart though was that he could play with his head up and see what was going on. He was always looking for someone off the ball. DJ KaneOur captain in  and an inspirational leader. DJ was one of the most competitive players I have seen in my le. He would not lie down and did not know what it meant to be beaten. It was win at all costs and he was someone you needed when things got bad. Gregory McCartanA massive character both on and off the pitch. Gregory kept the craic going in the changing room and in the bar afterwards. But he was also a tremendous footballer. He could take a free with either foot. He put money on himself to get the first score in the  final, which he did. Eamonn BurnsAn absolute gentleman, but a warrior on the pitch. He was quiet and unassuming, but had everything you wanted in a player. He scored two sublime points in the , which we won by two points, so he played a huge part in getting us over the line. His death came as a great shock. He is a much missed colleague. Ross CarrA Rolls Royce footballer. He had a wonderful left foot and was one of our two main free takers. Ross had a massive amount of inward drive and challenged us all to perform to the same high standards which he set for himself. Greg Blaney . Quite simply the best player I ever played with. He had it all. He was a brilliant ball player who made the forward line tick. He was always looking to play in James McCartan or Mickey Linden and wasnrsquot worried about scoring himself. An absolute team player. Gary MasonA superb free taker, particularly when under pressure. He never failed us. In June  he played for Down against Monaghan. It was the day after the Loughinisland tragedy. He must have been under enormous mental pressure and anguish, but he put on a massive exhibition and was man of the match. Mickey LindenWhat can you say about Mickey  He was an absolute flying machine and totally dedicated to Down football. He was still playing county football at the age of . A player of exceptional ability and one of the nicest men you could meet off the pitch. Peter WithnellA big, strong one-man wrecking ball. He would hit opponents very hard and early on. Peter brought something dferent to the team and his game fitted in well with the players Down manager Peter McGrath put around him. Many of their scores came about because of him. James McCartanConfident and aggressive with the ability to find space where he had no right to. Every time James got the ball, there was a buzz in the crowd. He was man of the match in the  All-Ireland final. He went on to manage Down and took them to the  final.Substitutes: Brendan McKernan , Aidan Farrell , Liam Austin , Ambrose Rogers Sr , Ciaran McCabe ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Heather.jpg","title":"Heather coaching the kids  ","story":"A COMBER soccer coach is keeping local children on the ball mdash despite the coronavirus shutdown.Heather Kerr normally coaches primary school children, but now she is passing on her skills online and on social media.Heather, a player and coach with Comber Ladies and an Irish FA staff member, admits it can be a challenge keeping children active and entertained in the current lockdown, but she believes she has the answers.Heather is also a key member of the IFArsquos Electric Ireland Shooting Stars programme aimed at young girls and she says keeping it fun is the key to keeping kids engaged with their extra-curricular activities.ldquoItrsquos all about making sure that they are having fun while learning something new, she says.ldquoEven though your little ones arenrsquot getting out on the pitch they can still be trying out new skills at home.Heather has been involved in football since an early age and was inspired by her dad, who was a coach.ldquoI started volunteering with the youth section of my local club, Comber Rec when I was , and Irsquove been involved in some sort of coaching ever since, she explained.ldquoI completed a weekrsquos work experience with the Irish FA around this time too and I really got a taste of all the dferent aspects of what is involved in football development.ldquoOver the years I worked through my coaching badges and recently completed my A Licence.ldquoI have been coaching in primary schools for the Irish FA since . I usually deliver approximately  school sessions per week to roughly  pupils in Newry, Mourne and Down.ldquoI play and coach for Comber Rec Ladies. I am proud to have played a key part in bringing womenrsquos football to my home town team and for helping to create opportunities for almost  seniors and  juniors to enjoy the game.Heather says parents can help teach their children with the help of weekly videos which are being released by the IFA and Electric Ireland.ldquoThese videos are fantastic tools for keeping your budding football stars interested in sport and passionate about football, as well as encouraging them to stay active while their usual activity sessions are on hold, she said.The Shooting Stars programme provides opportunities for girls aged - to have fun, make friends and learn the fundamentals of football. Sessions are normally held at  centres across Northern Ireland.Heather says the programme is a starting point for young girls who are encouraged to take the next step and join a local club.ldquoObviously with the current situation the sessions have not been taking place but the coaches have been working hard to ensure that the girls are staying connected, keeping up their skills at home by putting out a iety of social media videos with challenges and tips.The weekly videos can be viewed on IFA social media channels on Tuesday and Fridays..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Lockdown.jpg","title":"Lockdown no hindrance to local runners of all abilities  ","story":"A LOT is being said and reported about the absence of sporting activities on foot of the cancellation or postponement of many major events, including Sundayrsquos River Rock Belfast City Marathon, because of the need for social distancing to combat the spread of the Coronavirus.The postponement of the Tokyo Olympics will impact seriously on all the athletes who had been training for the races of their lives this summer, some as the culmination of their careers.But it is not only the elite runners, throwers and jumpers who have had their plans and lives disrupted by the world wide pandemic.It affects everybody who takes exercise in any shape or form, including the runners of all abilities who may not be a member of any athletics club but have been running for years and for whom running has become a way of le.I know that runners often go out on their own to train and in fact many have been resourceful over the past week in finding places which are virtually people free to enable them to complete their training sessions in safe surroundings. I havenrsquot been running for a few years now but I was persuaded to get up off my rear end and try to mark the th anniversary of the postponed London marathon due to be held on the very appropriate th April by running or walking or generally moving over a distance of  or . miles or kilometres.And having sorted out a route around my garden, estimated to be  metres long, I worked out that  laps per mile would be achievable over the five days specied mdash i.e. I could walk  laps to count as . miles. And I also asked my friends for some sponsorship towards the Cure Parkinsonrsquos Trust . I am hugely indebted to everyone who contributed towards this charity, and raised pound. plus pound. Gt Aid. Which reminds me I must go and finish the last eight laps.At the top end of the sport, international marathon runner and Rio Olympian Paul Pollock, while naturally disappointed that the Olympics have been postponed until , feels that it could well prove to be a blessing in disguise in his case at least.He reasons that it will give him an opportunity to concentrate on clocking up stress-free miles in training, enabling him to recover from old injuries and come to the competition, for the first time ever, in the best shape of his le.Portaferry star Ciara Mageean, Irelandrsquos greatest hope of an Olympic track medal since the halcyon days of Sonia OrsquoSullivan, is also disappointed, having been, as she says, in the form of her le, but, like Paul, will continue with her planned training regime and sees it as an opportunity to build up her strength and thus make up the ground on her nearest rivals.Eoghanrsquos viewNewcastlersquos Eoghan Totten, who aspires to taking part in a future Olympic Games as a marathon runner, in a recent interview published in the Athletics NI webpages said: ldquoWhen I recorded a : personal best over the half marathon in Barcelona in mid-February, the virus was relatively undocumented in Europe.ldquoBy mid-March, I understood that I would not be racing for a long time. My biggestfear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part.Double runshave always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon. Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to be running the Belfast Marathon this weekend, but your chance to do so will come around again in the future. Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness. More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months.Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.ldquoYes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training . So we have to love the training too.Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey.ldquoTo those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.Club updateThese words echo the sentiment of all of us and we commend all key workers who have been put in the front line in the course of their work. We have many EDAC members who are in that position and we send them our best wishes.So what of the last six weeks  The clubrooms were closed with immediate effect and the committee advised all members of the governmental advice to stay home and stay safe. The only good news was that there was no ban on exercising so long as training was done solo or in household groups.It may seem crass to be concerned about the ability to train when there are much bigger issues at stake, but it is well known that sticking to some routine is beneficial in keeping mental health in good order and anything which allows us to be positive will help us to cope with the situation that has evolved.Most have been taking daily exercise as prescribed by the government as it is already a part of our daily routine. However, because of the restrictions on movements and associations and the change of routine for many, whether through being laid off work, working from home, working for NHS at the coal face so to speak, or any of above combined with the added dficulties of home schooling kids of whatever age, it means that many runners are no longer free to go for a run whenever they chose or indeed will have to make signicant changes to their daily routine to fit it in.Some have turned their daily run into a practical outing where they canessential items to those who are shielding. Others have managed to combine their exercise with fund raising for charities involved in the frontline or for organisations who will see their funding hit by the economic fallout of the pandemic.Our juniors could be forgiven for thinking this is an unexpected long summer break, but they report back from time to time to log that fact that they are knuckling down to home schooling while using exercise to take a break.Jarlath and Anna Kearney have committed to a daily .k run, Mackenzie and Ky Murray have been out with their dad, Dee, making sure he doesnrsquot slack. Mackenzie even recorded an unofficial K PB this week.Ollie and Alex Robinson have the good fortune to be able to train as a family and they push each other as well as mum Marguerite. It is no surprise that dedicated athlete Lauren Madine is training away in between exercising the horses. Others such as Emily Burns have opted to cross train.If baking was an Olympic event, there would be a few EDAC records set there too by the sound of things. Tik Tok also seems to be a favourite occupation with some slick dance routines doing the rounds. The one thing that is clear is that our juniors miss their club mates but that physical exercise in any form is a big help. We are proud of our juniors for this mature approach and urge them to continue their efforts.Virtual challengesSome of the races that have been cancelled have then gone ahead in a virtual form, the Titanic K being one. Runners were invited to run a solo K on any course near their home and record the time.Three EDAC runners claimed the reward mdash a T-shirt and medal in the post. Gareth Reilly was the quickest of the trio, posting a -minute time. Hallie Jennings stole a march on Donal Smith by a couple of minutes mdash  minutes to his  mdash but with all runners doing dferent courses it was mainly for fun.Also for fun and the motivation to keep going was the Galbally Runners April Challenge. A simple concept where each runner chose a target of ,, or  miles etc and then had a month to complete. Evidence was submitted by Strava or fitness watch records.Kelly Smith and Donal Smith blew their goals out of the water with totals over  miles each. Marguerite Robinson, Hallie Jennings and Suzy Smith broke  miles in their inidual sessions and Alison Carroll completed a conservative  miles to start a new regime. They all agreed that it was a good way to keep base fitness. Buffs are apparently in the post and thanks are due to Galbally Runners for sorting this.Some runners were racking up the miles and others were thinking of improving speed. Jimmy Sloan has been following a programme which is hard without club members to egg him on, but he has been very successful nonetheless with a new K PB of .. All times are, of course, unofficial as they are not on measured courses but they are a good indicator of form.Jimmy was taking part in the NHS Run , Donate , Nominate . Many of our members will have taken part and the fun can be in nominating friends who would hate to run five km, let alone five miles mdash they canrsquot really refuse when it is for such a good cause!Every club has its mile munchers and in normal times Phillip Vint would see a weekend without a marathon as a waste of a free day. Like others, he has had to get used to a new normal, but when the weekend of the postponed London Marathon came round, he couldnrsquot resist setting off on a . mile course close to home to mark the day.No crowds to cheer him on and no sights of London to entertain him en route, but he was glad that he had the health to complete it. Predictably with the Belfast Marathon also called off, he repeated his endeavours seven days later and clocked another marathon with ease.The best bit is that the finish line is his own back door so no painful walk back to get the car or the train. He was straight to the sofa in seconds and recovery could begin.Donal Smith was to have completed his inaugural marathon at Belfast , as was his daughter, Kelly. Again their hard training seemed lost without a cause, but they had followed the programme to the letter and felt that they needed to test the waters.They set off to give it a rattle and coped well with the dry run of the full marathon distance. They were delighted to get the odd toot and cheer as a substitute for race day atmosphere and they received hearty congratulations when they posted their achievement on social media.While it would have been nice to have friends and family there to greet them at the finish line, it just means that they will have the incentive to do it all again when an official Belfast Marathon can eventually take place. At least they know that they can cope with the mileage and surely with the crowd support it can only be easier Last, but not least, EDAC ultra man himself Keith Reilly has been thinking up ways to raise money and satisfy his need for a challenge at the same time. He decided that his lockdown event would be a treadmill ultra and that he would appeal for funds for NHS Charities Together.He managed . miles running in hourly shts which is no mean feat on a treadmill and logged his th ultra marathon. He was delighted to announce a total of pound, for the frontline workers dealing with Covid- patients. A good dayrsquos work all round.So there you have it from both ends of the scale mdash what the top runners think and do and what the rest of us do. Not a lot of dference really is there  Letrsquos all continue to play by the rules and hope for better times. Stay safe and see you all when the lockdown is lted..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Loughinisland.jpg","title":"Loughinisland woman ‘was friend to all’  ","story":"THE artist son of a Loughinisland woman who has died has said his mother was his ldquobiggest fan.Sixty-four year-old Mrs Kate Sloan was buried in St Macartanrsquos New Cemetery in Loughinisland on Saturday.

on the latest phase of a mains gas pipe-laying scheme.The Recorder revealed last week that Phoenix Natural Gas has seized the opportunity to make the most of the coronavirus lockdown by bringing forward work on the scheme in the resort as part of its poundm investment programme across East Down.Work started last week at the Dundrum Road and Railway Street junctions with Main Street, with contractors switching attention to a stretch of road between the Railway Street junction and Castle Bridge, adjacent to Newcastle library, from this week.Next Monday, it is planned to lay a section of mains pipe between Castle Bridge and the Bryansford Road junction, while seven days later, contractors will be laying pipework along the Bryansford Road, between the Central Promenade and Shimna road junctions.This particular part of the scheme concludes with a pipe being laid between the Bryansford Road and Bryansford Avenue junctions at Shimna Road.Work in the town centre was scheduled to start towards the end of the year, but Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward in order to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents.Phoenix says it understands that Covid- has had a signicant impact socially and economically across the region and hopes that by expediting its works in Newcastle, it can utilise the lockdown period to not only avoid further disruption later in the year, but enable more people to have access to fuel choice before the winter period.The works will involve one lane closure mdash rather than a full road closure mdash with traffic management plans also in place and Phoenix aiming to utilise underground drilling equipment where possible.In addition, the company insists that its work will not impact on Newcastlersquos granite paving which was part of the resortrsquos multi-million pound public realm scheme completed a number of years

implementation of additional operational procedures, in line with government guidance.ldquoWe will continue to review the appropriateness of this activity on a daily basis to ensure that it remains

She also misses her boyfriend, who she hasnrsquot seen in a month.Ciara, who won the m bronze medal at the  European Championships and bronze again at the European Indoor Championships last year, happens to be in the form of her le.She improved on her own Irish indoor m record in January and smashed her personal indoor best at m a month later.Training and events were geared towards the Tokyo Games this summer but the Olympics have been pushed back to  because of the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoIrsquom feeling in fantastic shape so itrsquos a little frustrating - we had the whole season planned out, she said.ldquoEven down to the training camps you were going to go on, down to the very day that I was going tointo the Olympic village and then the day that I would possibly leave the Olympic village.ldquoIt is quite tough because all of those plans are all scuppered, itrsquos all up in the air and we donrsquot know when wersquore going to be able to start racing.ldquoThe circuit doesnrsquot have a clue when theyrsquore going to be able to race - it depends on when countries allow more movement and, ultimately, does anybody know ldquoIrsquom not going to feel too sorry for myself because I know therersquos an awful lot of people out there that are in a much harder place than me.In a recent interview with RTE Ciara revealed something about how she is coping with the coronavirus restrictionsQ Whatrsquos the first thing you do in the morning A At the minute when I wake up Irsquove been giving my boyfriend a wee call to say good morning. Irsquom not quite sure when Irsquoll get to see him next as Irsquom in Manchester and he is in Dublin so itrsquos a nice way to start my day and always puts a smile on my face.Q Whatrsquos your favourite exercise A Oh I feel like I should say running, as I am an athlete, butI was to think of my favourite it would probably be a few things. I do miss playing a team sport so probably camogie, I absolutely loved dodge ball in school sothat was an option Irsquod pick that, and I do enjoy my gym workouts getting to lt weights.Q Is there one particular skill you practice every day A Running, every day! Running is a gross motor sport so fine skills arenrsquot really a part of my daily training, but I do work on dferent areas of my fitness every day. I have to work on things such as flexibility and fine muscle control every day to keep myself injury free. In the athlete house though we have been honing dferent skills while on lockdown, trying out dferent Tik Tok dances, press ups, and trying to get our eye in with the sling shot in the back garden!Q Netflix and chill or a nice evening jog A Both, usually we have an evening run, easy four miles... then we chill and watch a movie after dinner. We have had to mix training up a bit with the changes but in an ideal world we get both in.Q Name one book you want to read.A Irsquom making my way through a few Malcolm Gladwell books. I love coming away with new information and enjoy a book that challenges my thought process. Then when I need to flake out Irsquod pick something like A Man Called Ove. Soanyone could recommend books like this to me theyrsquod be on my ldquowant to read list.Q On a scale of  to , how good are your DIY skills A Ohhhh, Irsquom going to give myself an . -  here. My daddy is a joiner so I spent my le watching him make and fix things, and soon learned the names of tools and how to use them. I do know my limits though so I stay away from the plumbing... luckily in Portaferry my dad has a lot of friends who are alsotradesmen so they all help each other out.Q Have you a favourite pre-training meal to help you through a tough session A We usually train in the morning so I tend to eat an OTE DuoBar, the vanilla flavour in my favourite, and a cup of tea. When it come to racing in the evening, something easy to digest is usually what I go for... rice is always a winner.Q Name one movie you want to watch.A , I was planning on watching it in the cinema before the lockdown.Q Whatrsquos the best way to stave off boredom A Oh as a full-time athlete I feel Irsquove been preparing for lockdown for years. My le is basically train, eat, sleep. For me therersquos a few things I enjoy. I love chatting with my family, Irsquom usually on WhatsApp most of the day chatting or messaging and keeping in touch. I also love arts and crafts, Irsquoll be making postcards to post to my boyfriend and siblings to make them laugh, and currently my little cousin is teaching me the guitar via WhatsApp. She is a tough taskmaster, I have a lesson every Thursday and Monday and homework in between so that keeps me busy Q Have you any tips for training at home A Set yourself some goals that you can realistically achieve from home. We are allowed out for our daily exercise so you can get some cardio in outside, find a route that works for you and follow the guidelines. When it comes to working out inside, have fun. Find new alternatives, there are so many exercises we can do with body weight, or with stuff we have about the house so be creative and have a bit of craic. If you need any ideas check out social media, so many people are sharing home workouts. Give yourself a plan or schedule and try to stick to it. Being home means we can fall into the habit of sitting about and it can be hard to feel motivated. At the beginning of each week set out your plan for the week, what day, what time, and what exercise. Write it down and stick it somewhere you can see. Creating a routineduring these strange times means we can take back a little control.Q Name one documentary you want to see.A Anything with David Attenborough, I absolutely love animals and nature, and could listen to his voice all day.Q Have you discovered any new music or podcasts A My music taste is so ied but my wee sis and cousin Tara introduced me to Beoga and I absolutely love it. A lad from my hometown, Ryan McMullan also features in some of their songs, always a nice surprise hearing a weePortaferry accent as Irsquom listening.Q Is there one piece of housework you can no longer avoid A My own room! I actually enjoy housework, everywhere but my own bedroom. Irsquoll clean all day but canrsquot be bothered with my own mess!Q Favourite room of the house to spend time in A We are lucky that the Team NB Manchester athlete house is lovely and has lots of space so my favourite room ies depending in the time of day. In the morning my bedroom gets lovely light, it makes me smile sitting there chilling. Then when I want a bit of company the front room or kitchen is where we chill as a team and have the craic... andthe sun shines, which it does on the odd occasion over here, we have a lovely garden.Both Jip and Adam are enjoying learning how to puck about with my hurl..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Recycling.jpg","title":"Recycling facilities to reopen  ","story":"THE districtrsquos household recycling centres could reopen next week.Located in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch, the centres closed at the end of March in line with the government directive to help reduce the spread of coronavirus.The Recorder understands that the sites will reopen, provided Newry, Mourne and Down Council can satisfy itself that the move can be managed safely and there is no risk to the public or frontline staff.Mid and East Antrim Council has already opened its recycling centres and Stormont environment minister Edwin Poots recently published guidelines aimed at paving the way for waste centres across the province to reopen.The reopening is expected to be discussed at todayrsquos virtual meeting between senior council officials and the leaders of the main political parties.Members of the local authorityrsquos senior management team are currently evaluating theenvironment ministerrsquos guidelines and developing a staff plan to allow the reopening to proceed in a safe way.In addition, officers are liaising with their recycling contractors, a number of whom have furloughed staff. The contractors are responsible for removing waste from all  council amenity sites, with early suggestions that it could take at least one week to ready themselves for reopening.With strict guidelines in relation to social distancing remaining in place, council officers are looking at the potential risks of reopening the sites and the required measures to mitigate them, with suggestions that ratepayers may have to book a slot to visit.Police and other statutory bodies, including the Department for Infrastructure, along with neighbouring councils, are also being consulted about reopening the sites.Council officers have suggested the recycling sites will open in a ldquophased manner and that certain restrictions will apply. Discussions with trade union officials are also planned.This Friday, the Northern Ireland Executive will review the current coronavirus regulations which could pave the way for the reopening of recycling centres not just in the local council area, but across Northern Ireland.Local councillors Willie Clarke and Billy Walker say Newry, Mourne and Down Council is right to carefully assess the guidelines published by Mr Poots and proceed with caution.They say the key importance is the safety of staff and residents, with the councillors suggesting that a visit to a civic amenity site would need to be classed as an ldquoessential journey under the current coronavirus legislation.Cllr Clarke says it is vital that the council approaches the reopening issue with caution, given that ldquocoronavirus is still rampant and people are dying.He continued: ldquoAny decision needs to be based on medical advice and direction from the Assembly.ldquoRecycling centres have not been classed as an essential service and people on their way to such a facility could end up getting stopped by police and issued with an enforcement ticket and sent home.ldquoThe council must ensure that all the Trsquos are crossed and the Irsquos dotted before the centres reopen. I understand there is a need across the community for this to happen, but my appeal to people is be patient for just a little longer.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoA phased approach to reopening the centres has been discussed by the party leaders. There is no point opening the centresthe contractors who remove the waste are not able to do so. A decision also has to be taken on what waste will be accepted at the sites in the short term.ldquoThe last thing we want is everyone landing at the sites, people getting out of their cars talking to one another and maybe not social distancing. People are still dying s a result of the virus and we must keep that in mind.Cllr Walker said that while many people have been cleaning their homes, garages and outhouses during the lockdown, the council needed to ensure that its civic amenity sites can reopen in what he described as a ldquosafe and proper manner.He added: ldquoWe need to manage the reopening process carefully and ensure there are not long queues of people waiting to use the centres, particularly in Downpatrick, Ballynahinch and Castlewellan, with tailbacks of cars spilling on to busy main roads.ldquoThe council does not want to put ratepayers at any risk and, in my view, is rightly proceeding with caution. It is not a simple case of opening the entrance gates and letting everyone in.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the decision to close the recycling centres is continually being reviewed in-line with government essential travel restrictions.ldquoThe council is currently reviewing this guidance and the implications it will present when it reopens the centres within the district, the spokesman continued.ldquoIf a decision is made to reopen the centres, residents will be informed via updates on the council website, social media channels and through local media outlets..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Ryan.jpg","title":"Ryan bakes tasty treats for heroic postmen  ","story":"SOME superheroes really donrsquot wear capes ndash they deliver the post.To honour the work of the often unseen heroes of the local postal service Ryan Bogues has delivered a hamper of his famous baked treats to the Royal Mailrsquos Downpatrick sorting office.The  year-old, who has Downrsquos Syndrome and lives in Teconnaught, has has to suspend his popular Ryanrsquos Cookie Box initiative, which he started over four years ago, because of the coronavirus lockdown.Ryan was praised by Prime Minister Boris Johnston last year for fundraising for several charities through his Cookie Box scheme where people donate money for his baked goods.Hersquos helped by his mother, Hazel, who explained a line in a recent speech from Taoiseach Leo Varadkar inspired them to think of local postal workers.ldquoMr Varadkar used the line lsquonot all superheroes wear capesrsquo and that struck a chord with us, she said.ldquoWe have had to close the Cookie box, but Ryan wanted to still help. We have an excellent postwoman and thought that the postal workers were among the very many key workers who were all working really hard to ensure that their service goes on as normal so we felt that they deserved a Ryanrsquos Cookie Box hamper.She added that Ryan bakes enough goods to donate two hampers per week since the lockdown and they have gone to nursing homes, pharmacists and hospitals as well.The hamper, which contained a range of buns, traybakes and lemon drizzle cake was well received by the  men and women who work at the sorting office at the Ballydugan Road Industrial Estate.Manager Donal Carabine received the hamper last week and said it helped lt everyonersquos spirits.ldquoEveryone at the delivery office has been working hard to both work in new ways to ensure everyonersquos safety at work while continuing with our service, said Mr Carabine.ldquoWe are delighted to have been recognised as being amongst key workers by Ryan and his mother and the baked goods are appreciated by all. We thank them for their generosity and I can assure them that the treats didnrsquot last too long.Mr Carabine said that the staff were coping with delivering items, mainly packages, and were as busy as they would be at Christmas mdash the busiest time of the year.ldquoI think the staff are coping admirably with the demand, as well as abiding by the two-metre social distancing rule in work. We have had to reorganise the office and stagger the earlier start times of some staff but they have all risen to the challenge.The Downpatrick office delivers throughout the wider Downpatrick area as far as Seaforde, Ardglass, Crossgar and Saintfield.Mr Carabine said: ldquoThe workers are more than holding their own in terms of maintaining deliveries and keeping themselves safe, although in some areas, due to the need to protect workers, the service is a bit later than usual..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Support.jpg","title":"Saintfield’s Leah battling to raise cash for charity  ","story":"A SAINTFIELD mum is throwing her weight behind a gruelling event to raise money for charity.Leah McCourt, a champion mixed martial arts fighter, is undergoing a test of strength and endurance challenge for Christian Aid, which is responding to the coronavirus crisis in some of the poorest countries in the world.Over five days, -year-old Leah will be attempt to complete , exercises carrying a weighted bag used by combat athletes to build strength.Starting on Monday, Leah will complete the daunting daily task of , squats and lunges while carrying on her shoulders the crescent-shaped lsquoBulgarian bagrsquo filled with  kilos of sand and wool.

We’ve been able to make a lot of changes that will be very positive and I think will become embedded in practice after this is all an awful memory. It’s incredible how the red tape has disappeared and has been replaced by a ‘can do’ attitude throughout the ious levels of the service.”What struck me most about her response was that it was very similar to what I’ve heard from others over the past few weeks. Indeed, I’ve been both surprised and heartened by the ‘can do’ attitude of so many of those who’ve found themselves on the frontline for weeks on end. For years we’ve taken these people for granted always expecting them to be there when we need them and then being surprised when we realise how much they’ve always been doing for us on a daily basis.It is worth bearing in mind – because it says a great deal about pre-crisis attitudes – that just a few months ago criticism of the NHS, of waiting lists, of missed appointments, of infections acquired during hospital stays , of suddenly cancelled operations, of crowded A and Es and of consultants not being available for months on end, was re. An increase in home working is an almost inevitable consequence of the coronavirus pandemic \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It took a crisis of this magnitude to make people realise the value of the NHS and it took a crisis of this magnitude for politiciansto realise how brilliantly, speedily and bravely the NHS was able to rise to this challenge. In a column for the News Letter a couple of weeks ago I expressed a fear that a key lessonfrom the crisis – the need for specic changes and increased funding for the NHS – would be forgotten once people believed le had ed to normal. Let’s be honest, there’s not much point in clapping todaywe cop out of the economic consequences tomorrow is there  Sadly, I still think that’s what’s likely to happen.I think it’s also likely that increasing numbers will remain working from home full-time. A lot of businesses have realised that it’s not necessary to have people driving, bussing, cycling or getting a train to work, just to sit in an office for hours on end. A computer or laptop works just as well at home. Meetings are easily arranged through Skype and Zoom. Staff can work in a way that suits them best. Flexi work becomes easier, not least because offices don’t need to be kept open from am to pm. Computer technology has already created paperless offices and it was almost inevitable that peopleless offices wouldn’t be far behind.What we’ve seen across the world since January has been the test-driving of a new way of running businesses and running our personal lives. Again, it has been heartening to see how well we’ve all adapted how so many of us have realised that it is possible to do things dferently and maybe even do them better. I was listening to an interview with someone who has spent almost four hours every day commuting to an office in the centre of London to sit at a computer at a desk because, “well, that’s just the way it has been done for years. When this ends a lot of us, with the firm’s blessing, will continue to work from home”.There is an advertisement on the back of last week’s The Economist: ‘Tradition is history. Disruption is the law of tomorrow. The rules of business and society have changed. % of jobs that will exist in  haven’t been invented yet. How will you embrace the opportunities  Discover what you can do with the law of tomorrow, today...’. I’m old enough to have already seen a huge change in working and types of work in my letime and I’m now going to see another huge change. People shouldn’t be scared. Societal upheaval is normal following a great crisis or change . This health crisis has already made us reassess a number of the fundamentals of our everyday lives and how we live them. So yes, there will be consequences and changes: in how we live our lives and in how we work. Our welfare state – with the NHS at its heart – is probably the single most important consequence to follow the VE Day celebrations in . As a nation, we knew that we wanted change.Certain types of crises can be predicted and war-gamed. It’s absolutely certain, for example, that there will be new economic collapses, political upheavals and pandemicseach of which will result in sweeping changes and new ways of doing things. There may even be a world war . All of these eventualities can be thought about, computer-modelled and tested. What we cannot test is the psychological impact on the millions of iniduals who will bear the brunt of the impact.But even the experts didn’t predict that the two minutes silence on VE Day would happen under lockdown conditions. No one had war-gamed that possibility. Anything and everything can change: and change without warning. For young people that’s the most important lesson to take from this crisis.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I am the President of Sinn Féin. I want a United Ireland. That much is obvious.There is no shame in that, nor is there any shame in unionists disagreeing with that point of view either.Irish unity is a perfectly legitimate aspiration. The Good Friday Agreement, designed to give parity of esteem to both the British and Irish identities and to our political aspirations, clearly states as much. There is no faux outrage when unionists talk about valuing their British identity or their hopes of maintaining the union with Britain. Nor should there be. It is every bit as legitimate as my desire for Irish unity. While Empey dismissing republican aspirations is insulting, dismissing the need for an all-island approach to combating Covid- is downright reckless. The need to maximise our advantage as an island is basic common sense.The notion that containment measures one side of the border ought to be in harmony with those two miles down the road on the other side is basic common sense.The idea that our exit strategies from Covid- restrictions — underpinned by better testing and contact tracing — should be the same north and south is basic common sense.In times past, such as the Foot And Mouth Disease outbreak in , our communities put dferences to one side to protect livestock.If we can do that for livestock, we sure as hell can do it to save the lives of our loved ones.This isn’t an easy situation for anyone and naturally there will be disagreements along the way. But we should all be united by the one goal of keeping our communities safe.That is why my Sinn Féin colleague, Joint Head of Government Michelle O’Neill, argued strongly to close schools in the north at the onset of this crisis.This was not an attempt to create a green v orange wedge — or of following Dublin’s way rather than London’s way. It was to keep our children - and by extension, you — infection free.The initial response of the British government has been exposed as being the wrong one. We were right to call that as we saw it — Westminster’s change in tack confirmed as much.But this current crisis does not mean we cannot continue to talk about a better Ireland where everyone is valued, respected and treated with equality either. The support for Irish unity is growing by the day. It cannot be dismissed. Republicans are realists and know partition cannot be wished away. We know that constitutional change will come about when the majority of people on this island want it, in line with the Good Friday Agreement. That is why we are talking about Irish unity and want unionists to get involved in that conversation. We don’t expect them to become advocates of Irish unity overnight. But unionists can play a key role in shaping a better society. Trying to suppress that conversation will fail. It is already under way and indeed some within unionism are already taking part. I invite Reg and others to join that constructive dialogue on the future for us and our children and play his part too.Mary Lou McDonald TD, Sinn Fein president"},{"url":null,"title":"what news letter readers think about easing lockdown ","story":"Tragedy for PSNI widow Kate Carroll after son Shane found dead at same age stepfather Stephen was murderedNI kitchen painter wins£, on National Lottery ScratchcardNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensCoronavirusFarmingNewsPeopleThis is what News Letter readers think about easing the lockdownWe are now  days into the lockdown, and readers of the News Letter have had their say on how and when restrictions should be eased.By Valerie MartinTuesday, th May , : pm\"\"Our lockdown survey, published across this title and  others across the UK last week, has had a great response.It gives an insight into how the coronavirus crisis has impacted people in Northern Ireland and what they would like to see happen in the coming weeks and months.In total we asked readers  questions on their attitude towards the lockdown. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

By comparison, on a national level, % answered ‘slightly concerned’, % answered ‘very concerned’, % answered ‘not very concerned’ and % answered ‘not at all concerned’.Of those who took part in the survey, a majorityof News Letter readers said visits to family and friends should be given the highest level of priority when restrictions are eased.

The job retention scheme will be extended, for four months, until the end of October.By that point, we will have provided eight months of support to British people and businesses.

We’ve seen some retailers doing delivery numbers they thought they’d be doing in eight years’ time.“But there’s a big, big thing here - there are people out there, disabled, elderly, and we’re asking the public to think before they click. Quite simply, delivery slots should be for the most vulnerable in society.”Instead the public should either get their own groceriesor get click-and-collects.The whole surge means that “here in Northern Ireland our retailers are hiring proportionately... some are permanent contracts, some are temporary”.He said they were “hiring for attitude, and training for skill” - meaning people with few qualications can still find roles in the supermarkets.He also said that “one of the laziest  narratives out there is that retailers are making a killing”. Rather, their margins have been squeezed by people buying cheaper ‘own brand’ goods instead of treating themselves.Lastly, he voiced “pride” in how day-to-day staff are handling themselves in the crisis, adding there is a “zero tolerance” approach to people shouting and becoming confrontationalasked to socially distance themselves.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
