But there were repeated reports that officers felt \u0027uncomfortable\u0027 at having to drink to Andrew\u0027s health at the end of regimental dinners.Lt Gen Walker also said in his email: \u0027Buckingham Palace have informed me that in due course the colonelcy, along with the duke\u0027s other titles and affiliations, will be reallocated to another member of the Royal Family.\u0027He added that he would write to Andrew \u0027to thank him for his time as colonel\u0027.Formed in 1656 by Charles II, the Grenadier Guards have fought in almost every major campaign of the British Army, including the Napoleonic, Crimean, Boer, First and Second World Wars.York Racecourse yesterday confirmed it will rebrand one of its most historic events, the Duke of York Stakes, in a bid to distance itself from Andrew.The six-furlong sprint was first staged in 1895 and derives its name from Prince George, Duke of York, who became George V.The racecourse\u0027s head of marketing and sponsorship, James Brennan, said: \u0027It has never been directly about Prince Andrew. However, we are going to explore how we can make the name a lot clearer about its history – and that the name refers to an entirely different Duke of York.\u0027Andrew was a patron of the course, and a regular attendee at flagship fixtures, until he relinquished the role in 2019.The prince has now been forced to withdraw entirely from public life in the wake of his association with disgraced paedophile Epstein and his sex trafficker girlfriend, Maxwell.Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre claims she was lent out by the pair and forced to have sex with Andrew three times when she was 17. She is now suing him for rape and sexual assault in a civil court.The prince has always vehemently denied the claims. He was last week forced by the Queen to hand back all his royal privileges in order to fight the US case as a \u0027private citizen\u0027."},{"url":null,"title":"Father just started breathing without oxygen support year caught Covid","story":"Share this articleLondon\u0027s \u0027sickest ever\u0027 Covid patient who spent nearly a year in hospital only just able to walk again - MyLondon"},{"url":null,"title":"CIA says Havana Syndrome not result sustained global campaign hostile power","story":"Share this article \u0027We are working overtime across the entire government to get to the bottom of what happened, who\u0027s responsible. And in the meantime to make sure that we\u0027re caring for anyone who\u0027s been affected and to protect all of our people to the best of our ability,\u0027 he added.   The European incidents now add to the list of roughly 200 reported cases of the yet unexplained illness, colloquially named for its first reported case in 2016 at the US Embassy in Havana, Cuba.Almost half of the cases involved CIA officers or their relatives, nearly 60 have been linked to Department of Defense workers or relatives, and about 50 involved State Department.In October, three Havana Syndrome sufferers came forward to share the agonizing symptoms of the disease, with two of them claiming it left them brain damaged and destroyed their promising diplomatic careers.Tina Onefur, Kate Husband, and Husband\u0027s partner Doug Ferguson were all working for the US State Department, stationed in Cuba\u0027s capital, when they found themselves afflicted with the mysterious malady.The syndrome first surfaced at the embassy in Havana in 2016 - months before Onefur, Husband, and Ferguson were diagnosed. The three described their debilitating symptoms - which include hearing loss, severe headaches, memory issues, dizziness, grogginess and even brain damage - in detail during an interview with NBC News last year. Onefur, sobbed as she spoke and recalling the fact she can now only work two hours a day from home due to doctor-diagnosed brain damage, and said she was washing dishes one night in March 2017 at her home in Havana when she suddenly found herself overcome with pain.\u0027The kids were upstairs playing, and I was standing at the kitchen window, and all of a sudden I felt like I was being struck with something.\u0027When asked what the sensation felt like, Onefur said the pain was like nothing she had ever felt before in her life, and explained, \u0027It was gripping - it was like I\u0027d been seized by some invisible hand, and I couldn\u0027t move.\u0027When asked by interviewer Andrea Mitchell how her health is today, Onefur, choking back tears revealed that her symptoms were still as strong and prevalent as ever, even after more than four years.\u0027It\u0027s not easy to talk about our health because it\u0027s an invisible injury,\u0027 Onefur said,\u0027It\u0027s four-and-a-half years of of excruciating headaches, it\u0027s four-and-a-half years of stumbling losing my balance, four-and-a-half years of vision degradation,\u0027 Onefur asserts of the illness, while breaking down in tears.In a nearby neighborhood in Havana in the winter months of 2016, Kate Husband and Doug Ferguson were working in the US embassy by day, with their nights spent together at their shared home.But nights for the couple - who both hail from Michigan - would often be strangely interrupted, by a high-pitched, piercing noise seemingly coming from their backyard.\u0027It was persistent, kind of at the same level all the time,\u0027 Husband said of the shrill sound, which they never managed to identify, adding it was \u0027very, very loud\u0027 and \u0027nothing you can sit with.\u0027Ferguson, however, managed to capture the mysterious noise on his phone and played it back for Mitchell during the interview.The sound on the recording - a high-frequency ringing that somewhat resembles a dog whistle - is strikingly similar to a sound previously released by AP in a 2017 covering the then just-surfaced syndrome.When asked if any other people in her neighborhood had heard the same sounds and was afflicted with similar symptoms, Husband said they had.After feeling a slew of symptoms in the coming months, the couple was later examined by neurologists at the University of Pennsylvania.In early 2017, Ferguson was cleared to go back to work, but Husband was diagnosed with brain damage by doctors, and was subsequently sent to receive treatment.Husband told Mitchell that during the diagnosis, a doctor told her, after analyzing scans of her brain, \u0027it\u0027s like you aged 20, 25 years all at once.\u0027She later retired from her work for the State Department on the grounds of a medical disability.Husband further revealed during the interview that she still suffers from balance issues associated with the brain damage she suffered after the 2017 diagnosis - a sensation that would trigger violent bouts of nausea, and a fogginess that makes even the most basic tasks difficult.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Schools defy end Plan B Teachers vow masks classrooms","story":"Share this articleBoris Johnson calls civil servants back to office to inspire private sector | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Katie Prices ex Kieran Hayler accuses party making false claims","story":"Share this articleKatie Price¿s ex-husband Kieran Hayler will be quizzed by cops over three rape allegations"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8da1e4c34ea06a8e72259053a253144199bb4462/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=7c87c59bf11ccabe6bb000dcb4df1c5d","title":"abf escalating costs energy inflation primark uk economy stock markets us jobless business live","story":"The number of ‘initial claims’ for unemployment benefit jumped to 286,000 in the week to Saturday January 15th, the highest level since October.  That’s an increase on the 231,000 initial claims filed in the previous week. It indicates that more Americans lost their jobs at the end of 2021, and were signing on for unemployment insurance. Initial claims fell to their lowest since 1969 late last year, as the tight labor market encouraged firms to hold onto staff. They are still much lower than earlier in the pandemic, despite rising this month. Initial claims surged to 6 million in late March 2020, but fell back to pre-Covid levels as the economy reopened and vaccines were rolled out. The increase came after the government ended work-from-home guidance immediately on Wednesday afternoon, with Sajid Javid claiming the Omicron coronavirus variant was “in retreat”, despite the number of new infections running at more than 100,000 a day. After struggling in the last few weeks due to anxiety over looming interest rate rises, markets may be regaining some calm ahead of next week’s Federal Reserve meeting. Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at Think Markets, says Associated Press points out that if claims remain elevated, it could deter central bank policymakers from lifting interest rates as quickly as expected: Danel Zhao of Glassdoor says that demand for workers is still high, despite omicron slowing the recovery: Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor to Allianz, also blames Omicron.  Omicron has caused significant disruption in the US, as cases hit record levels above one milion per day. Supply chains have struggled leading to empty shelves, schools closed, flight were cancelled, and hospitals and emergency response departments were left understaffed.

Ryanair has experienced a “sea change” in its confidence in recent weeks, a senior executive said today.

Reuters has the story: The CBRT sat on its hands after Erdoğan struck a softer tone on interest rates this week, telling reporters that rates would fall slowly, gradually and without hurry” to make 2022 “our brightest year,”. In a special address to WEF’s Davos Agenda event, von der Leyen said that “tragically”, we again face the interference of some powers in their neighbours’ affairs. Europe will not accept Russian attempts to ide the region into “spheres of influence”, she insisted, adding that “we reaffirm our solidarity with Ukraine and our European partners that are threatened by Russia”. She’s speaking a day after US president Joe Biden caused alarm by admitting Nato was ided on how to respond if Russia makes a “minor incursion” into Ukraine, where Russian troops have been gathering. Europe, von der Leyen says, continues to stand behind the fundamental principle that Ukraine is free to decide as a sovereign state. Von der Leyen also announced that the European Chips Act will be proposed in early February, to strengthen the EU’s semiconductor industry. Mulligan adds that people should support their local retailers, to help them through the economic pain.Rising food prices, energy and fuel bills were the main reasons, highlighting how the jump in inflation is hurting people. That’s another sign that the cost of living squeeze is hurting, after higher cost of clothes, food and footwear pushed up UK inflation to its highest in 30 years in December.Primark, which operates 191 stores in the UK and more than 400 in total internationally, said it was creating a new management level role as part of the reorganisation but overall expected the changes to leave it with about 400 fewer retail managers in the UK. The company added that although supply chain pressures had now eased it still expected that longer shipping times would “continue for some time”. That means that more firms saw falling turnover than rising turnover last month. It’s the highest proportion reporting a fall in monthly turnover since April 2020, when the first Covid-19 lockdown hit the economy. The ONS’s latest real-time economic indicators showed that average company turnovers fell between late November 2021 (when the Omicron variant was identified as a threat) and early January 2022. That’s an early indication of the economic damage caused by Omicron at the end of 2021, after the economy had achieved strong growth in November, back to its pre-pandemic levels. Hospitality firms and retailers were badly hit by the Plan B move in December, as we’ve already heard this morning from Revolution, and Primark. But there are signs that business has picked up in January, as Covid-19 cases fell back from record levels.

A small number of key workers will not have to quarantine at all if they have no symptoms, despite having been in contact with a sick person. “In order to deal with the high rate of infection, that is also expected to increase in the coming period, and in order not to put social functions at risk, we are adjusting the recommendations for testing and for restrictions,” health agency official Sara Byfors told a news conference. Johan Ahlander reports for Reuters from Stockholm that the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency said staff shortages could become a real problem and that key workers in areas such as power, heat, water and internet distribution as well as in the emergency services could be exempted from the quarantine rules. Sweden on Thursday reported a new daily record for Covid-19 cases, registering 39,938 cases, marginally higher than the previous day.  The health agency said a large proportion of the population risked getting the virus in coming weeks. The real number of cases was likely to be substantially higher as the national test capacity has hit its ceiling. The health agency asked people who can work from home not to get tested to allow those who need to be at their jobs to continue to work.PA Media are also reporting these are the plans for the easing of Covid restrictions in Northern Ireland which may get approved today: On Wednesday, Javid said: “We must learn to live with Covid, in the same way we have to live with flu. We’re looking to replace legal requirements on self-isolation with advice and guidance.” But with Omicron remaining highly infectious and deaths from the latest variant still rising, social care providers are being cautious and demanding clarification from the government.

The premier did not provide a new date for when quarantine-free travel would be allowed into WA. Nevertheless, the list of people exempt from the hard borders will increase. People attending funerals, court, visiting those in palliative care or who are terminally ill, or those with strong recent connections, will now be allowed into the state after testing and quarantine. McGowan labelled the Omicron Covid spread a “new state of emergency” but said the border rules would be reviewed during the coming weeks.

I am slightly nervous because it’s been a long time but it’s the right thing to do, to get back to the office, and I’m happy I’m doing it,” she said. Emma Reeves, who works in the charity sector, was taking the opportunity to go to the office to collect some equipment before returning to work from home. “The government has only told us it’s OK to come back to the office because they want to be seen to be doing something,” she said. “We’ve had the same rules in place for ages and they need to change them every so often, to look like they know what they’re doing.

However, the figures are still significantly higher than absence levels seen before the Omicron surge. At the start of December, there were about 12,000 absences on an average day.

We have come through Omicron better than we might have expected prior to Christmas.’ Photograph: iStockThe National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) is meeting on Thursday to discuss the easing of restrictions, as the Taoiseach said some measures could begin to lift next week.Signals from Government figures and officials have been upbeat in recent days over the current wave of the virus and the potential for a sooner-than-expected unwinding of some restrictions.Micheál Martin said the current restrictions had been due to stay in place until the end of the month but this could change.It is expected that Nphet will approve the removal of the 8pm closing time for the events and hospitality sector, which has been in place since before Christmas. Ministers will meet on Friday to assess the Nphet advice before the Taoiseach announces the decisions.Mr Martin said he will give a “clear and comprehensive statement” on Friday about the plans for the weeks and months ahead. “The situation is positive. We have come through Omicron better than we might have expected prior to Christmas,” Mr Martin told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland.“The combination of the booster campaign and vaccination and the fact that Omicron does not seem to be as virulent as Delta and previous waves has meant that the impact on people, in terms of severe illness and death and ICUs, has been much less. So, therefore, I think people can be positive, we can be positive.”Ireland is entering a new phase, he said, and changes are expected to happen next week. “The original restrictions were there till the end of the month, we may now go before that,” he added. “I do want to allow Nphet to meet today but yes, I think we can look forward to an earlier lifting of restrictions than we might have anticipated.”He said measures including the wearing of masks will continue for some time.Public holidayThe Government on Wednesday announced a raft of measures designed to thank the public and frontline workers for their efforts during the Covid-19 pandemic.Among the measures announced is a one-off public holiday on March 18th, as well as a tax-free payment of €1,000 to frontline healthcare workers. Mr Martin said the details of the scheme are still being worked on and the date of the payment has yet to be confirmed.He said those in line to receive the bonus have “more or less” been decided, but that a panel will be established to assess the plans. “There is a panel to be established because it’s a complex enough area, in terms of categories of workers and so forth,” Mr Martin added.There were 896 patients in hospitals with Covid-19 as of 8am on Thursday, and 90 in intensive care, according to the latest Health Service Executive figures. This represents a drop of 15 patients in hospitals compared with the same time the day before.Professor of immunology Christine Loscher said there had been a clear decline in Covid-19 case numbers, as well as “positive indications” from health service staff about Omicron’s impact.“I think that’s enough reason to be able to row back on restrictions now, and take advantage of the fact that we’re in a good position,” she told Newstalk Breakfast.“We thought maybe a few weeks ago we could have up to 50,000 cases a day, we’re now at about 12,000 cases a day,” she said.The surge in cases had not been followed by a similar “translation into hospitalisations”, which meant there was no justification to delay easing restrictions, she said. – Additional reporting PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"current booster phase of vaccine programme to last until april","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin arriving for a Cabinet meeting at Dublin Castle om Wednesday. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins PhotosThe current booster phase of the vaccine programme will last until April, with mass vaccination centres to be retained up until then for people who were recently infected with Covid.A high-powered meeting was told on Wednesday that hundreds of thousands of people will need to be given their boosters in the coming months, as they contracted Covid before being boosted.They will become eligible at different stages up to April, depending on when they caught the disease. There are at least 500,000 people who received either positive PCR or antigen tests recently and they will be ineligible for a booster shot for three months after diagnosis.The figures were given by Health Service Executive chief executive Paul Reid at a meeting of the Covid Oversight Group (COG), which is also attended by members of the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet).Sources at the meeting said chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan indicated the Covid-19 situation was improving, but the numbers remained high. However, on the eve of a key meeting of Nphet, Coalition figures believe the direction of travel on unwinding restrictions is now near-irreversible.“The writing’s on the wall for the last week: with all the indicators, you cannot restrict the public to the extent we are from normal activities without justification,” one source said. Nonetheless, the Government expects there will be a rebound in case numbers once restrictions are relaxed in the days and weeks to come – a similar trend was observed in Denmark recently.‘Well beyond’ peakTaoiseach Micheál Martin told his parliamentary party the country is “well beyond” the peak of the Omicron wave of the pandemic and is in a good position to begin a phased lifting of\u0026nbsprestrictions.He said the booster programme was delivered in an “impactful and efficient way” and Covid-19 case numbers are “reducing significantly”. Mr Martin said “the situation is much better than feared” but that the unboosted and unvaccinated should be encouraged to avail of the jabs.The focus is now likely to switch to targeting those who have yet to come forward.Some health sources believe the retention of the Covid pass for indoor dining, which the Government has indicated will be phased out, would help uptake rates – especially among younger people, where it is lagging. That idea enjoys some support, with one Cabinet source saying on Wednesday they would favour the retention of the cert if it were proposed.Elsewhere, Coalition figures are also eyeing upcoming tapering of Covid schemes in the coming months, including the employment wage subsidy scheme, and eligibility terms for the pandemic unemployment payment. “If it’s all systems go in respect of sectors being open and trading uninhibited, I suspect everyone knows what that means for supports,” one Minister said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"most havana syndrome cases unlikely caused by foreign power cia says","story":"The US embassy in Havana, Cuba, where reports of mysterious symptoms emerged in 2016.  Photograph: Meridith KohutThe New York TimesThe CIA has found that most cases of the mysterious ailments known as Havana syndrome are unlikely to have been caused by Russia or another foreign adversary, agency officials said, a conclusion that angered victims.A majority of the 1,000 cases reported to the government can be explained by environmental causes, undiagnosed medical conditions or stress, rather than a sustained global campaign by a foreign power, CIA officials said, describing the interim findings of a comprehensive study.The CIA is continuing its investigation into two dozen cases that remain unexplained. Those cases, said a US official briefed on the findings, offer the greatest chance of yielding clues to whether a foreign power is responsible for some of the unexplained health incidents that have plagued American diplomats and CIA personnel in Havana and Vienna, among other cities.In addition to those two dozen cases, a significant number of others remain unexplained, the official said.The idea that Russia, China or Cuba was responsible for attacking hundreds of diplomats around the world was never backed up by any evidence that the Biden administration could unearth. But the FBI, the Pentagon and others continue to investigate whether a foreign power was involved in a smaller number of incidents, the US official said.Clusters of incidents in Havana beginning in 2016 and some in Vienna in 2021, along with other inidual incidents, remain a focus of such investigations.Victims unhappyThe interim findings left many victims dissatisfied, particularly current and former officials who have been battling chronic ailments for years without being given a clear explanation. In a statement, a group of victims said the CIA interim findings “cannot and must not be the final word on the matter”. The release of the findings, the victims said, was a breach of faith.“The CIA’s newly issued report may be labelled ‘interim’ and it may leave open the door for some alternative explanation in some cases, but to scores of dedicated public servants, their families and their colleagues, it has a ring of finality and repudiation,” the statement said.CIA director William J Burns said the agency was pursuing a complex issue with “analytic rigour, sound tradecraft and compassion”, emphasising that agency officers have experienced real symptoms.“While we have reached some significant interim findings, we are not done,” Burns said in a statement. “We will continue the mission to investigate these incidents and provide access to world-class care for those who need it.”The agency has never accused Russia or another power of being responsible, but some officials, particularly in the Pentagon, said they believed there was evidence of the involvement of Moscow’s spy agencies, and many victims concurred. When Burns travelled to Moscow in December to warn Russia against invading Ukraine, he raised the issue of the health incidents and said if Russia was found responsible, there would be consequences.Marc Polymeropoulos, a former CIA officer who suffered Havana syndrome symptoms on a trip to Moscow in 2017, said it was critical to continue to investigate the cases that remain unexplained. Praising Burns’s efforts to improve care for injured officers, he added that the CIA should not revert to a culture where victims were denigrated and dismissed.“It took us 10 years to find Osama bin Laden,” Polymeropoulos said. “I would just urge patience and continued investigation by the intelligence community and the department of defence.”Extraneous casesAnother victim, who asked that his name not be used because of his work for the agency, said the government had erred by pushing for more people to report ill health or unexplained symptoms. That brought in thousands of extraneous cases, the victim said, making it harder for the agency’s analysts to focus on the real cases.The government official briefed on the findings said the effort to bring in large numbers of reports was not a mistake because it allowed the United States to speed up treatment for people suffering from symptoms. The effort also helped provide needed treatment to people with previously undiagnosed conditions, officials said.CIA officials said there was agreement within the intelligence community about the finding that the majority of Havana syndrome incidents were not the work of an adversarial power conducting a sustained campaign around the globe. Still, confidence in that assessment ranged from low to high across various intelligence agencies.In addition to the CIA, an expert panel has been looking at classified information about the incidents. The panel, which has provided its findings to the government but is still finishing its report, explored technologies that could result, at least theoretically, in the symptoms being reported.When made public, that report is expected to provide information on whether directed energy or microwaves could account for some of the unexplained incidents. A directed energy weapon remains the hypothesis that a number of victims who have studied the incidents believe is most likely. Some of these current or retired officials believe government investigators have dismissed evidence they have collected of strange sounds or electromagnetic readings.But late last year, officials said the CIA had been unable to find any evidence that a directed energy device was responsible, neither intercepting communications from a foreign government that suggested the use of such a device or readings showing the presence of microwaves at the location of an incident.Asked if directed energy or microwaves remain a leading theory for the cases still being investigated, an agency official said no potential explanation was being eliminated. Of the cases that have been resolved, some had medical explanations, including previously undiagnosed conditions, while others were said to have had environmental causes, though CIA officials did not offer examples. Some of the cases, officials said, were potentially related to the high stress of working at the CIA.Some outside experts believe that stress has contributed to psychosomatic reactions or so-called functional illness. Many victims have found those explanations for chronic headaches and nausea offensive.Last year, Congress passed a law compensating victims of Havana syndrome, and giving the government until April to devise a payment plan. It is not clear how the interim findings could affect that process. CIA officials would say only that they were working on implementing the law, that their decisions were not yet due and that they were mindful of congressional intent to support officers reporting symptoms.The statement by the victims said they hoped the interim report was not motivated by a desire on the government’s part to deny claims made under the act.Havana embassyWhile some former officials said cases of similar injuries stretch back decades, the most recent spate of ailments began at the end of 2016, when CIA officers and diplomats working in the US embassy in Havana reported strange sounds, pressure and then various ailments including nausea and debilitating migraine headaches.Those incidents were followed by multitudes of reports in China, then in Vienna. Other reports have come in from around the world, including Russia, India and Vietnam.A review released in 2020 by a team from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found that a microwave weapon was the most likely cause of the injuries. Victims of the attacks had frequently pointed to various reports over the years about Russian research into directed energy weapons and the capacity of microwaves to cause brain injuries. But critics said that effort was incomplete because the Trump administration had not given the team access to classified information.Many senior Trump administration officials, including leaders at the CIA, viewed the incidents sceptically, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to conclude that the mysterious incidents were attacks or that Russia was behind them. Some of those officials were influenced by an FBI report that concluded the ailments were a kind of functional illness or stress-induced psychosomatic response.The Biden administration took office with Burns and others pledging to get better treatment for victims for what they called the anomalous health incidents. They also started new efforts to study what had happened. They formed a new scientific review panel, led by the intelligence agencies, to examine all of the evidence, classified and unclassified. The CIA formed a new cell, led by a veteran of the effort to find bin Laden, to figure out what happened.Last year, Burns and other officials said the agency was focused on some 200 cases that remained unexplained. The agency is now focused on two dozen. – This article originally appeared in The New York TimesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"In one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"economic storm clouds gathering","story":"Amid his many travails, Boris Johnson must hope that a few more days will see the “partygate” furore subside, assuming the inquiry by the senior civil servant Sue Gray provides the wriggle room to escape. But it will be but a temporary reprieve before the economic storm clouds start to gather in the spring.Arguably, they are already here. An analysis by the Resolution Foundation think tank suggests that, for the third time since the financial crash of 2008, real wages are falling once more and began to do so way back in June.With inflation expected to hit 6 per cent as taxes go up and energy bills double, the painful impact on household budgets is easy to foresee. Yet just a few months ago at the Tory conference in Manchester, Mr Johnson was extolling the emergence of a high-wage, post-Brexit economy. At the time, shortages of labour, especially drivers, were expanding pay packets. Bosses were told that their reliance on cheap imported workers had to end and they needed to “invest in their people”.On the jobs front there is better news, confounding fears that the pandemic would cause mass unemployment. In fact, employee numbers are at record levels though much depends on what sort of jobs these are. If they are predominantly in low-paid sectors, declining real wages will be problematic.Furthermore, the state itself is a drag on the economy with public sector productivity falling as vast sums were ploughed into the NHS and elsewhere to combat Covid. Mr Johnson is hopeful that a spurt of economic growth will be the harbinger of a high-wage economy in the run-up to the general election.

But that’s exactly what Joe Biden did one year ago today, following the example set by his Democrat predecessor, Barack Obama.It was evidently an omen. Once hailed as the man who would “restore America’s standing in the world”, Biden is overseeing the stunning decline of the world’s superpower. A year after taking office, he is flailing at home and abroad, and could well end up a lame duck halfway through his presidency.If the Republicans take the House of Representatives and Senate in the mid-term elections later this year, Biden will be practically powerless on the domestic stage to further implement his agenda. He will be reduced to conducting America’s foreign policy, which is already proving to be a monumental disaster.In the wake of the Afghanistan withdrawal debacle, America’s standing has sunk to lows not seen since the end of the Vietnam War. Even the Carter days look benign compared with the feckless Biden era.In the past few months, I have spoken to dozens of parliamentarians, officials and diplomats across Europe who have simply lost faith in American leadership. One very senior British MP told me last week that Biden’s foreign policy was “appalling” and “completely useless”. And this is coming from America’s closest friend and ally, the UK. With an unashamedly anti-Brexit stance, and an arrogant willingness to lecture Britain on the Northern Ireland Protocol, Biden has succeeded in undermining the Special Relationship. As for America’s enemies, they see Biden as a soft touch, whose time in office is a welcome opportunity to challenge America’s might and undercut the country’s strategic power. It is no coincidence that, with the former senator from Delaware in the White House, Russian forces are massing on the border of Ukraine, China is openly threatening to invade Taiwan, and Iran is rapidly building up its nuclear programme. Under Donald Trump, the adversaries of the US were far more careful not to pick a major fight with a president who was often unpredictable, and clearly ready to wield American military capabilities – as he did with the perfectly timed drone strike that took out General Qassim Soleimani, the commander of Iran’s feared Quds Force, at Baghdad Airport.But Biden’s weakness abroad has been matched by a reckless domestic agenda that plays to the far-Left of the president’s own Democratic Party. A huge expansion of government spending and massive increase in federal debt has helped fuel the biggest rise in inflation in 40 years. Americans have faced a 7 per cent overall increase in prices in the past year, with supply-chain issues resulting in the first major shortages in US supermarkets in several decades.Against this backdrop of economic turmoil, major cities across the country are experiencing soaring crime rates, the direct result of foolhardy Democrat-led “defund the police” initiatives, and dangerous liberal sentencing policies. Looting has become so commonplace in San Francisco and Los Angeles that it barely makes the national news bulletins.Biden’s America has become a byword for economic turmoil, urban decay, rampant lawlessness and far-Left policies that are tearing the fabric of the United States apart.Joe Biden’s first year in office has been catastrophic. With good reason his poll numbers are tanking, and the American people are increasingly turning against the most Left-wing presidency in US history. As witnessed in the dramatic recent election for governor of Virginia, a conservative revolution is coming to the US at both the state and Congressional level, with November’s mid-term elections likely to dramatically shift the balance of power on Capitol Hill.The United States will eventually recover, and it must do so for the sake of the American people and the free world. But we should expect three more years of relentless decline and retreat as Biden’s out-of-touch presidency continues to drive the country’s downward spiral and humiliation.Nile Gardiner is the Director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at The Heritage Foundation.

They shriek that the addition of one, or even a small handful, of former Tories to the Parliamentary Labour Party is the equivalent of placing a tiny drop of black paint into a pristine can of white emulsion: once it’s mixed in you might not notice it’s there, but they know it’s there and that the purity of the paint has been irreversibly compromised.True, Wakeford followed his (former) party’s whip during his short time in parliament, which is why his defection came as a bolt out of the blue. Had he been an infamous rebel against the government, yesterday’s coup might not have had quite the impact it did.

Welcoming this new addition to his ranks, the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, gleefully introduced Wakeford as the “honourable member for Bury South”. I beg to differ. Wakeford’s actions are deeply dishonourable and an insult to Red Wall voters in his constituency, many of whom voted Conservative for the first time in 2019 only after wrestling with their conscience.Tribal politics was on full display in the House of Commons on Wednesday. Wakeford wore a Union Jack mask as he crossed (or should that be scuttled over?) the floor to sit on the Labour benches. Previously, he had been happy to use all sorts of abusive terms about Labour MPs. Suddenly, they were his friends. On the Conservative benches, there was much finger-pointing and booing. Insults were hurled, the least of which was “disgrace!” Boris Johnson’s performance was far more robust than his miserable TV interview the day before. A betrayal of the party is the very worst thing that can happen in first-past-the-post politics, and his MPs rallied around him. Confidently, he predicted that Bury South will be won again by the Conservatives under his leadership at the next general election – two claims which look doubtful at this point. Yet as the session wore on, I waited and waited for what I had hoped would be the killer line from the Prime Minister. He never uttered it.  I was anticipating that Johnson might have the wit to demand that Wakeford behave with some degree of honour and submit himself to a by-election. It would be particularly appropriate for this backbencher, of all MPs, to do so. In September 2020, he co-sponsored and voted for a private members’ bill that would “enable the recall of Members of the House of Commons who voluntarily change their political party affiliation and for connected purposes”. It is a near-certainty that in his case, this will never happen. The sheer hypocrisy of this man knows no bounds.My own 25-year battle against the British establishment evolved from merely wanting to leave the European Union to wanting to change politics for good. I believe our entire political system is in need of radical reform. Millions of people hoped that Brexit would herald the start of a new era in politics. Sadly, the Wakeford affair shows that old habits die hard. Political parties and MPs appear to worry more about themselves and their careers than the vital issue of public trust. Over the last 30 years, there have been 23 defections in Westminster. Of these, only two MPs have triggered by-elections immediately. I am pleased to say that I was involved in both of them. In 2013 and 2014, I and the late Stuart Wheeler, who was then UKIP’s treasurer, discussed with a number of sitting MPs the possibility of them crossing over to become UKIP MPs. Every one of them – and there were several – would have been a huge asset to our campaign, yet I was insistent that the only proper course of action would be to hold a by-election to legitimise the switch. Honourably, Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless agreed, and both won their subsequent by elections. I had hoped that we had set a new standard in politics and in public life. Clearly, I was wrong. Wakeford\u0027s behaviour and sense of entitlement is despicable. He seems to think that every Conservative voter in Bury South voted for him personally. In truth, very few MPs have much of a personal vote. General elections now tend to be decided by people voting for or against the main party leaders. I hope sincerely that the Labour Party in Bury South de-selects Wakeford. We don\u0027t need people like him in politics today. The Conservative Party must seize this opportunity – not just to prevent further defections, but to show the country that Brexit is just the beginning of re-establishing trust between the governors and the governed. Legislation should be put forward requiring any MP who defects to hold a by-election. After the student drinking culture in Number 10 that has been exposed recently, such a move might just be a way for the Conservative Party to save itself. I won’t, however, hold my breath. More from NewsCovid latest news: Clearing hospital waiting lists \u0026#39number one issue\u0026#39 for British people, Boris Johnson saysPeople in glass houses… Scientist gives interview on environmental harm of conservatories - from her conservatorySajid Javid: Covid may be here forever, but we have to learn to live with it\u0026#39Christian Wakeford has saved Boris\u0026#39: Up to seven no confidence letters withdrawn by nervous Tory MPsWatch: Pentagon releases footage of botched Afghanistan airstrikeMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sadiq khans mask mandate stalling londons recovery","story":"Is Sadiq Khan a fifth columnist? The London Mayor is certainly acting like he does not want capital to recover from Covid.Khan announced this week that masks will remain a condition of travel on Transport for London even as the government’s ‘Plan B’ mask mandate came to an end. This is virtue signalling that will keep Covid present in our lives while doing little for public health.Khan asserts that mask-wearing is the ‘single most important and easiest things we can all do to prevent the spread of Covid-19’. This is a pious declaration without evidence. It is preposterous to suggest that masks are more important or effective than getting vaccinated or staying at home when you are unwell. The arbitrariness of the mandate demonstrates that this is little more than political posturing.Face coverings have become a bizarrely partisan issue.  At first, we were told not to wear masks — a ‘noble lie’ to prevent health professionals from running short. Then we were instructed that they are essential to save lives. These mixed messages left many people questioning the government’s scientific advice throughout the pandemic.Surgical masks likely marginally reduce the spread of the virus — the Bangladesh randomised control trial suggested by a modest 9 per cent. Those who are particularly vulnerable may well be advised to continue to wear a mask of surgical or N95-standard. But we should exaggerate their importance. The effect of wearing masks just on public transport — either on your way to an open plan office or to socialise with friends — is likely to be practically zero.More broadly, mask mandates make little sense as the virus turns endemic. We just saw how more draconian restrictions in response to omicron in the likes of France and Germany did not achieve markedly different outcomes to England.The good news is that the ongoing threat from Covid to public health is minimal, thanks to the high take-up of vaccinations and the relatively mild omicron variant. The best masks could do is have a negligible impact on slowing the inevitable: that everyone will contract Covid multiple times throughout their lives, as Professor Francois Balloux of University College London has explained.The limited benefits of continued mask mandates need to be carefully weighted up against the costs.London, like many other cities across the world, has taken a battering from Covid. Working from home turned the city into a ghost town, bars and restaurants have closed while high street shopping has markedly declined. The rise of omicron and introduction of ‘Plan B’ at the end of last year seriously undermined the nascent recovery — for which we wait to see the full impact.For some, masks are no bother at all for others, they are unbearable and a symbol of state control. The only impact of the mask mandate will be to make Covid an ever-present feature in our daily lives. This risks increasing anxiety and discouraging people from getting back to normality, and not the so-called ‘new normal’. The result may be that we see fewer people using public transport — further contributing to TfL’s mounting deficit and service reduction — while hamstringing the recovery of the capital’s struggling hospitality and retail sectors.The best we can hope for is that this does not go on for much longer. Khan must be clear about the evidential basis for mask-wearing and what data will be used to end the mask mandates. How low, exactly, do cases, hospitalisations and deaths — which are already in decline — need to fall?We should not underestimate the power and importance of cities. London has a magnetic pull, bringing together ambitious people with ideas, opportunity, and excitement. It has survived previous pandemics and has the potential to thrive once again.

The Health Secretary defended comparing the virus to flu despite over , UK deaths, saying it would become endemic in future thanks to vaccination and better treatment. He said Brits would “probably” need annual vaccinations against Covid like against flu. But he insisted he plans to axe mandatory isolation for infected people from March  - with a final decision on the date “in the next few weeks”.It comes as England’s Plan B work-from-home guidance - along with face masks in school classrooms - have both been axed as of today. From next Thursday England will also axe mandatory Covid passes for nightclubs, mandatory face masks in shops and on public transport, and face masks in communal areas of schools.The government has also vowed to scrap free lateral flow tests in future, with a leaked document suggesting this will happen from the end of June. But Mr Javid also said he would choose to wear a mask in a supermarket or on the London Underground, with guidance continuing to recommend them in enclosed spaces. And one exception is Mr Javid still plans to press ahead with plans to force frontline NHS staff to be vaccinated as a “condition of deployment” from April .Asked by Sky Newshe meant to compare Covid to flu, Mr Javid replied: “Yes”. He said: “If at the start of covid when we had no vaccines, we had no testing infrastructure, we had no treatments, people were comparing it to flu - that would’ve been wrong.” But he added: “We need to learn to live with it. Sadly people die of flu as well. In a bad flu year, you can sadly lose about , lives. “But we don’t shut down our entire country and put in place lots of restrictions to deal with it. We need to continue with our lives with sensible, appropriate and proportionate measures.  “The one thing we’ve learned about flu, because it’s been around for far longer, is we have annual vaccinations, for older people in particular, for children as well. We have good advice. “We may well have some kind of annual vaccination. I think that’s where we’ll probably end up, but it’s really dficult for anyone to say exactly in the longer term where we’ll be. He added: “Covid is not going away. It’s going to be with us for many many years, perhaps forever, and we have to learn to live with it.”Yesterday Boris Johnson confirmed to MPs that the remaining Plan B rules in England would be allowed to expire on January  as the peak of the Omicron wave appeared to be over.The under-fire Prime Minister suggested the country was shting towards living with Covid - like flu - as he battled to save his premiership.  The PM told MPs: There will soon come a time when we can remove the legal requirement to self-isolate altogether, just as we donapost place legal obligations on people to isolatethey have flu. As Covid becomes endemic, we will need to replace legal requirements with advice and guidance, urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others.Mr Johnson also told MPs the Government now intended to set out its long-term strategy for living with Covid- , adding: Explaining how we hope and intend to protect our liberty and avoid restrictions in future by relying instead on medical advances, especially the vaccines which have already saved so many lives.But to make that possible we must all remain cautious during these last weeks of winter. There are still over , people in hospital in England alone. The pandemic is not over.

The revelations add to the pressure on Boris Johnson as he prepares for Ms Gray’s long-awaited report to be released next week.Mr Cummings has accused him of lying to Parliament by claiming he “implicitly believed” the May  party where he spent  minutes was a work event.The Tory leader faces a weekend in limbo after several Tory MPs decided to wait until Ms Gray’s report before sending a letter of no confidence. A government source told the Times Ms Gray - who was due to interview Mr Cummings - is “genuinely struggling to reconcile” the Prime Minister’s account with that of other interviewees. “It’s very dficult for her,” the source added. It’s understood Sue Gray has not yet handed her findings to Downing Street and is currently unlikely to do so before next week.  No then has control over the timing of publication. Officials have promised to reveal Ms Gray’s report quickly and Boris Johnson will give a statement to Parliament. But despite the PM’s spokesman saying earlier this week “I think it will be published in full”, the report appears likely to redact names of staff -they are included at all. It is possible the report given to No will not go into line-by-line detail about who did what and when, instead presenting a summary or broad-brush findings to the PM. The terms of reference suggest Ms Gray will only establish a “general understanding of the nature of the gatherings”, though this can include the “attendance, setting and purpose”. While she can recommend disciplinary action against inidual staff, this would be kept secret - and Ms Gray cannot rule directly on whether Boris Johnson broke ethics rules. Any breach by Boris Johnson would have to be investigated by separate advisor Lord Geidt - who can only investigate with the PM’s permission, and whose findings can be overruled by the PM. Asked todaythe Sue Gray report would be published in full, the PM’s spokesman said today: “The Prime Minister has promised to publish that in the House and that remains the case.”  Earlier this week he replied to the same question by saying “yes, we’ve committed to publishing it in the House.” He added: “I think it will be published in full.” However, it’s understood there could be redactions ordered by Sue Gray’s team itself. Mr Cummings revealed the existence of the e-mail reply to Martin Reynolds on his blog on Monday. He wrote: “On  May, after the PPS sent the invitation to the drinks party, a very senior official replied by email saying the invite broke the rules. “This email will be seen by Sue Gray .” No have denied Mr Johnson saw or was alerted to Mr Reynolds’ original email invite. Dominic Cummings tweeted today: “Episode  of no saying aposcummings lyingapos then evidence shows no is lying... “NB Broadcasters shd now assume no is lying unless strong reason to think contrary, given lying is default mode as regime implodes.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyRobert PestonMartin ReynoldsBoris JohnsonPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Senior Conservative William Wragg accused No, special advisers and whips of blackmail against MPs unhappy with Boris Johnson.In an explosive statement in Parliament, he suggested rebels should report their concerns to the police. The Prime Minister said he had seen no evidence to support any of those allegations as he visited a diagnostics centre in Taunton. He said he would of course look for evidence to support Mr Wraggaposs allegations.  But Mr Wakeford revealed that he was told he would lose out on a schoolhe didnapost toe the line.He told BBC North West: I was threatened that I would not get the school for RadclfeI did not vote in one particular way.This is a town thataposs not had a high school for the best part of  years. How would you feel when holding back regeneration of a town for a vote  It didnapost sit comfortably and that was really starting to question my place where I was and ultimately to where I am now. Labouraposs Jonathan Ashworth accused the Government of being rotten to the core.  The Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary said: Tories play politics with the le chances of young people. Boris Johnson’s government is rotten to the core. Mr Wragg, the Tory chairman of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, sparked the explosive row when he revealed that he had received reports members of staff at  Downing Street, special advisers, government ministers and others encouraging the publication of stories in the press seeking to embarrass those who they suspect of lacking confidence in the Prime Minister. He said the whips were responsible for pushing forward Government business but added: It is not theirto breach the ministerial code in threatening to withdraw investments from members of parliamentaposs constituencies which are funded from the public purse. Mr Wragg told the Commons hearing: The intimidation of a Member of Parliament is a serious matter. Reports of which I am aware would seem to constitute blackmail.  As such it would be my general advice to colleagues to report these matters to the Speaker of the House of Commons and the Commissioner of politan Police. The senior backbencher is among the Tories who have publicly confirmed that they have submitted letters of no confidence in the PM. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said it could be a contempt of Parliament to block MPs from doing their work - and warned that MPs and their staff are not above the criminal law. While the whipping system is long-established, it is of course a contempt to obstruct members in the discharge of their duty or to attempt to intimidate a member in their parliamentary conduct by threats, he said. But Tory MP Michael Fabrican branded Mr Wraggaposs comments nonsense. If I reported every time I had been threatened by a whip ora whip reported every time I had threatened them, the police wouldnapost have any time to conduct any other police work, he said. A No  spokesperson said: We are not aware of any evidence to support what are clearly serious allegations. If there is any evidence to support these claims we would look at it very carefully.

Several potential defectors are being wooed by the party in the aftermath of Christian Wakeford’s bombshell switch, it is understood.Sources warned against any imminent defection - but one suggested there could be a breakthrough in future. The source said the door is always open, adding: “I’m not expecting an imminent second one - but that doesn’t mean there won’t be one. “We’ll have to see what happens over the next few weeks.”  The PM’s position temporarily stabilised following Mr Wakeford’s dramatic decision, with claims some no-confidence letters had been withdrawn. Backbench MP Andrew Percy said Mr Wakeford’s defection had “kind of made people a bit more relaxed, itaposs calmed nerves”. He added: “I think people have recognised that actually this constant navel gazing and internal debating is only to the advantage of our political opponents. “The Prime Minister is probably thanking Christian for what he did because itaposs made a lot of people think again, think twice.But Mr Wakeford was in talks with Labour for months, pre-dating Partygate after he privately voiced concerns about the direction of the government.And today’s Tory unity may just be a stay of execution as No braces for next week’s make-or-break investigation by senior civil servant Sue Gray.Senior Tory William Wragg, who has already called for Mr Johnson to quit, today accused government figures of aposblackmailapos to persuade MPs to stay loyal.  Veteran Tories could seal Mr Johnson’s fate next week after the report is published. Insiders fear it will not fully clear the PM. Itaposs not going to be as good as people think,” a Government source told the Times. “Sheaposs genuinely struggling to reconcile the Prime Ministeraposs claim that this was a work event with what sheaposs been hearing from other people. “Itaposs very dficult for her. One Labour source said: “There are obviously a number of people on the Tory benches who are feeling uncomfortable with their current position, and reflecting on whether they’re in the right.“It’s a massive show of confidence in the Labour Party that someone who’s been in the Conservative Party can see this is a party serious about government.”But they warned against any imminent new defections and said: “Other people have expressed dissatisfaction with where they are but that doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll cross the floor - it takes a tremendous amount of courage to do that.”  A second source said: “I don’t think there’s any imminently because it’s such a big political thing. “The first one is the hardest - no one doing it for  years creates a kind of aura about it that’s quite hard to break. But it’s a big thing to do regardless... I’m not aware of anyone whose headspace is ‘I’m in the wrong party’.”Health Secretary Sajid Javid desperately tried to shore up the PM, saying he thought Mr Johnson was secure in his post - despite calls from some Tory MPs for him to resign over Downing Street lockdown parties.Askedthe PM was safe in his job, Mr Javid said: Yes, I think he is. At the same time, people are right to be angered and pained about what they have seen and they have heard. I share that anger and pain. “I think it is right that there is a proper investigation going on that will establish the facts and that the Prime Minister will come back to Parliament and properly respond. Mr Javid called for Mr Wakeford to trigger a by-election in his Bury South seat.  Mr Javid admitted David Davisaposs call for the PM to quit was damaging for Mr Johnson.The former Brexit Secretary quoted from the  Norway Debate when he urged Mr Johnson to stand aside, telling him In the name of God, go.Mr Javid conceded: It is damaging, of course it is. The Health Secretary also said thatMr Johnson was found to have broken the law he would have to go. The Ministerial Code is very clear. If any minister from the Prime Minister down breaks the law, of course they shouldnapost continue to serve as a minister, he said. What I have just said is a general rule that applies to everyone. There is no exception to that rule. He admitted the scandal had damaged UK democracy. If there were people at the heart of government who were not following the rules, absolutely they should be disciplined and I look forward to seeing that disciplinary action taking place, he said. We do now know there were some parties. We know that because some of the people that were involved and broke the rules have come forward to say so. Of course things like this damage our democracy.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyLabour PartyDavid DavisBoris JohnsonCivil servantsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Angry Red Wall MPs have been heaping pressure on the Prime Minister as Westminster buzzes with rumours over how many letters of no confidence have gone into the Tory backbench  Committee. Only  chairman Sir Graham Brady knows the true number but tensions are running high as Boris Johnson tries to win over his mutinous MPs. Six senior Tories have openly called for Mr Johnson to quit but reports of a Red Wall rebellion are adding to the PMaposs woes. Dubbed the pork pie plot as a meeting was hosted by the Melton MP Alicia Kearns, it underlines the level of anger among some of the  intake.And Bury South MP Christian Wakeford dramatically abandoned the Tories for the Labour Party on Wednesday. Here we look the new rebels making le dficult for Boris Johnson. What is a aposRed Wallapos Tory MP  The term loosely refers to the Conservatives who won their seats off Labour during Boris Johnsonaposs  election landslide. The Red Wall is a nickname for Labouraposs traditional heartlands in England and Wales, particularly seats in the North of England, North Wales and the Midlands . A swathe of these seats turned Tory in , including Tony Blairaposs old seat of Sedgefield, in Co Durham, Blyth Valley in Northumberland and Workington in Cumbria. These MPs were perceived as loyal to Boris Johnson but discontent has been mounting over broken promises on levelling up and rail reform. Partygate has also landed badly with voters, and some of these new MPs may be feeling vulnerable going into the next election. Who are the Pork Pie plotters  Alicia Kearns The former Foreign Office official has been outspoken about the UK’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and the handling of the crisis by senior civil servants. Ms Kearns, , MP for Rutland and Melton has hosted meetings of anti-Johnson plotters - leading to the plan being named after Melton Mowbray’s most famous export. Her , majority in the safe blue East Midlands seat allows her the luxury of plotting.  Dehenna Davison The PM’s then girlfriend and now we Carrie was pictured campaigning with Ms Davison in Bishop Auckland, Co Durham in the run-up to the  ballot. The -year-oldaposs stunning victory was the first time the Tories had won the seat in nearly  years. The arch Brexiteer presents a GB News show with ex-UKIP chief Nigel Farage.  Gary Sambrook The Birmingham Northfield MP is a Covid passport rebel and said the PM must consider his positionhe is found to have broken lockdown laws. As secretary of the  Committee, Mr Sambrook, , would be one of the MPs responsible for running a no-confidence vote and subsequent leadership race. Chris Loder The former train guard, , worked his way up through the industry to become head of new trains for South Western Railway. His majority of , in the Conservative stronghold of West Dorset should make him electorally immune to fury at the PM and Partygate. Christian WakefordThe Bury South MP didnapost attend the meeting but he became the first Red Wall Tory to say publicly that he had submitted a latter of no confidence.Within  hours he had defected to Labour, dramatically joining the party for Prime Ministeraposs Questions on Wednesday.In an excoriating letter to Boris Johnson, he said: Britain needs a Government focused on tackling the cost-of-living crisis and providing a path out of the pandemic that protects living standards and defends the security of all. It needs a Government that upholds the highest standards of integrity and probity in public le and sadly both you and the Conservative Party as a whole have shown themselves incapable of offering the leadership and Government this country deserves.He added: My decision is about much more than your leadership and the disgraceful way you have conducted yourself in recent weeks.

Sir Graham Brady, chair of the all-important  Committee made up of Tory backbenchers, has not yet received the magical  letters that would trigger a vote of no confidence. Political pundits believe many Tories are now awaiting the results of the Gray investigation before deciding whether or not to pull that trigger.  Johnsonaposs alleged contempt for the rules put in place to help prevent the spread of coronavirus over the past two years has caused anger throughout the nation.In response to the frustration - which stems from millions of Brits making huge sacrices, including not being able to be with elderly loved ones - an investigation has been launched into the string of gatherings. At the helm of investigation sits Sue Gray, the most powerful person youaposve never heard of.Who is Sue Gray   Senior civil servant Sue Gray served as Director General of Propriety and Ethics in the Cabinet Office between  and .Before this, she worked in the departments of Transport, Health and Work and Pensions. After these roles, she took a career break in the late s to run a pub in Northern Ireland before joining the Cabinet Office in the s.She now holds the role of the Second Permanent Secretary to the Cabinet Office, a role charged with leading on the Union and the Constitution.When is the Sue Gray report into Downing Street party allegations   The report is now expected to be released no sooner than Monday next week - the exact date remains to be confirmed. PM Johnson confirmed the report is expected next week during his embattled PMQs on January .The reason no one has any hard and fast answers about the reportaposs release date stems from the additional revelations cropping up about more parties alleged to have taken place. What does the Sue Gray investigation cover   The primary purpose of Grayaposs report is, according to the Cabinet Office, to: Establish swtly a general understanding of the nature of the gatherings, including attendance, the setting and the purpose, with reference to adherence to the guidance in place at the time.The scope of the report initially set out to cover the Downing Street Christmas parties on November  and December , but the number of dates under the microscope has now been extended to include two parties that took place on the night before Prince Philipaposs funeral on April . According to the terms of reference set out for the investigation: Where there are credible allegations relating to other gatherings, these may be investigated.They also state that: If required, the investigations will establish whether inidual disciplinary action is warranted. The terms set out that investigators will have access to documents and will be able to speak to staff throughout its course. It is now understood that Grayaposs investigation will now include an interview with Johnsonaposs former aide, Dominic Cummins over the claims he made that that the PM lied to Parliament.Is the Sue Gray investigation independent  One key concern remains, however, about the independence of the investigation. This is because despite being at the heart of Grayaposs explorations, Boris Johnson is also the person who gets to decidethe next stage of the investigation can actually go ahead.After Grayaposs report, Johnson will have the final say as to whether the Prime Minister’s advisor on ministerial interests, Lord Geidt, can actually start an investigation into any breaches of ministerial code.Speaking on the matter, Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, said: “The PM has set the terms of Sue Gray’s probe and he has chosen to exclude the conduct of Ministers from it, creating a neat loophole for himself.“Any judgement on the conduct of Boris Johnson goes to... Boris Johnson. “A farcical circular process from a Prime Minister that will escape responsibility in any way he can.

Labour leader Keir Starmer said: I would like to welcome Christian Wakeford to the Labour Party. He has always put the people of Bury South first.But Health Secretary Sajid Javid told Sky News: “I feel sorry for the people of Bury South. I think a by-election would be welcome… I think Christian should be happy with a by-election”. He added: “They’ve got an MP who’s changed his affiliation without their permission”. Labour has indicated there will not be a by-election. So what do the voters of Bury South think  We spoke to them.  In the town of Prestwich, which sits in the Bury South constituency, there was a mixed response today to Christian Wakeford’s defection from Tory to Labour. Sham Raja, , said: “It’s so shameful. He signed up to be a Conservative MP. It’s disgraceful, he was elected under the Conservative banner.“There are lots of small businesses struggling at the moment and he’s said nothing about this. Boris Johnson was the only guy to bring us out of Europe and get Brexit done.“I think he should step down as an MP andhe wants to be a Labour MP, he should apply to be one. “He’s not won on a Labour  and he should take it upon himself to step down.” Jeremy Burtles, , said: “There should be another election – you can’t just switch. If you want to change parties, you need to step down. “You always vote for the party you want in charge so I think it’s ridiculous to switch all of a sudden. “If you’re going to change your view, you should just step down.” And Hazel Donnelly, , said: “I don’t think it was very good at all, he shouldn’t be allowed to do that.  “It won’t change the way I vote because I am a Conservative. “I don’t think it’s a big deal what Boris did - there are much worse things that have happened recently. “There should be certain rules with these things. I think he has broken a rule but there are more important things going on at the moment.” But Barry Humphries, , backed the MPaposs decision. He said: “Good for him, I think he’s doing what’s right for him and he’s standing up for what he believes in.” And Ifkan Ahmed, , added: “I’ve always been happy with him. I think these days it’s okay to change your policies. “He has been very good for our area and I’m happy with what he’s done. It doesn’t matter to me that he has changed.”  Vickie Stone, , said: “If he wants to do it because of Boris Johnson then I think that’s fair enough. “If he doesn’t agree with the way Boris is handling the situation then that’s up to him. “I’m more bothered about the leadership, I’m worried about who is going to replace Borisit ends up going that way.” In Radclfe, the centre of the constituency, the MPaposs office, painted in true-blue Tory colours, was shuttered. Outside on the street, ex-Labour and current Tory voter Mavis Leach said: Well, Iaposm surprised. Are there others doing it, as well, getting out of a sinking ship before it goes down  Mrs Leach, who said she disavowed Labour because of a dislike for former leader Jeremy Corbyn, said Boris Johnson should stay on as Prime Minister.I know heaposs done wrong, done a lot of things wrong, she said. Boris has done a lot of things. We know that. But I think heaposs done a good job in other things,bringing the vaccinations in, and weaposre in a good place for that. Another local, Jonathan Boston, a Labour supporter, said Mr Wakefordaposs change in loyalty is really good news. Presumably, itaposs all to do with partygate, he said, referring to allegations of lockdown-busting parties within No , though a Labour spokesman has since said talks with Mr Wakeford began before the scandal hit. Mr Boston said: From what one hears, all the MPs have had millions of emails from constituents saying, aposItaposs terrible and heaposs got to go,apos so I donapost think any Tory voter, even in Radclfe, or Bury South or whatever, would be surprised at .probably the first of many, I would have thought, especially the newer MPs. I think a lot of the newer ones will do a similar thing. Meanwhile, Chris Holland said he rated Mr Wakeford as a local MP but had not voted for him. He said: Iaposve never voted Tory and I never would do. Iaposve messaged him a few times and he has got back to me. To me, heaposs not been doing too bad. Iaposd rather have a Labourthan a Tory. David Collins, who runs Marieaposs Coffee Shop, a stoneaposs throw from Mr Wakefordaposs constituency office, said: I probably wouldnapost vote for either of them anyway, Labour or Conservative. Theyaposre all as bad as each other. They all promise theyaposre going to do things and none of it ever materialises, does it  You wouldnapost think you were able to jump ship halfway through, would you   Tory voter Joan Humphreys said she feels like her tick at the ballot box has now been wasted. She said: I feel like going down there and saying, aposRight. I want to withdraw it.apos If he wants to become Labour, and he wants to support Labouraposs policies, we should have a by-election and see what the people say. If Boris had held his hands up at the beginning, people would have been far more forgiving about it, but heaposs not. But who are you going to have instead of Boris  I canapost see anybody .

Scientists now believe the country is passed the Omicron peak and a move back towards no restrictions was thought to be the right step.Now, people are no longer required to work from home, and from next Thursday, face masks are no longer required in public places like shops and public transport. The countryaposs capital was filled up once more as commuters headed back out to get back into their offices and workplaces. Pictures show some of the countryaposs busiest transport hubs overflowing once again with Brits. London Bridge was once again filled with commuters rising early and crossing the capital to their work place. Stations like Waterloo and Kingaposs Cross were busy once again, but not quite reaching pre-pandemic levels of commuters. Whilst the work from home rule was only guidance, and a number of industries and companies couldnapost work from home, many thousands of Brits were forced to turn bedrooms back into offices. Underground lines were filling up again as the country hopes this year might be the year the pandemic becomes endemic. Commuters braced the cold weather and embraced the bright skies this morning to get back into the office.Johnsonaposs announcement came amidst a turbulent time for the PM as he fights for his political le and can only watch as a Tory MP crosses the floor to Labour. It has been reported that the announcement scrapping the remaining Covid guidance was apart of a move to save Johnsonaposs reputation. The announcement for England came at a similar time that Scotland also announced that most of its Covid restrictions will go next week. Nightclubs will reopen, large indoor events will commence again and social distancing rules are being torn up too. The guidance advising adults against meeting up with more than three households at a time is being scrapped alongside curbs on indoor contact sports.

The Articial Intelligence programme would offer results within minutes and would be a big boost to healthcare staff, it has been claimed. Experts at the University of the West of Scotland say the speed of results would aid the frontline battle against the deadly bug.A PCR test typically takes around two hours to inform of a positive or negative result. But the Articial Intelligence programme detects the virus much faster and the idea would boost hospital care around the world.  An AI process uses an algorithm to analyse visual imagery and make a quick diagnosis. Professor Naeem Ramzan led the three-person team behind the project, which also involved Gabriel Okolo and Dr Stamos Katsigiannis.In his latest update, he wrote: There has long been a need for a quick and reliable tool that can detect Covid-, and this has become even more true with the upswing of the Omicron iant.Several countries are unable to carry out large numbers of covid tests because of limited diagnosis tools, but this technique utilises easily accessible technology to quickly detect the virus.  Covid- symptoms are not visible in x-rays during the early stages of infection, so it is important to note that the technology cannot fully replace PCR tests. However, it can still play an important role in curtailing the viruses spread especially when PCR tests are not readily available. It could prove to be crucial, and potentially le-saving, when diagnosing severe cases of the virus, helping determine what treatment may be required.  Professor Milan Radosavljevic, Vice-Principal of Research, Innovation and Engagement at UWS, hailed the signicance of the development. This is potentially game-changing research, he said.

The driver of the other vehicle, John Keith Williams, from Llanfairpwll, Anglesey, told the hearing he had no recollection of the crash.Mr Williams, who was diagnosed with type one diabetes in the early s, was left confused after suffering a hypoglycemic event, North Wales Live reports.  He had been travelling west in the eastbound carriageway for almost five miles in his Nissan when he collided with Mr Jonesapos Hyundai on the hard shoulder between junction  and . He sustained a serious head injury in the collision and was flown to Stoke with le-threatening injuries. Mr Williams said that he did not remember anything of the week leading up to the crash or in the three days after he was left with memory loss caused by the head injury. Unfortunately I have no recollection of the drive that day. Nothing has come back to me at all from day one - itaposs frustrating because obviously, I would like to have had clarity myself into what happened on the day to help myself, my we and to help his family but unfortunately that is not the case.  I have experienced a hypoglycemic event before and always have jelly babies in my vehicle or in my pocket, I would take five or sixI felt the onset of a hypoglycemic event and would feel normal within  minutes. Mr Williams was told by a doctor after the crash that as a long-term diabetic he was at very high risk of suffering a no-warning hypoglycemic event. They occur when blood sugar levels drops too low, which can be triggered by high or excessive activity. On the day of the crash, Mr Williams had been building a shed and carrying large bits of timber but he did not consider it to be high activity for him and said that he had eaten responsibly in accordance with his needs. Barrister Sarah Sutherland, representing the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, said Mr Williamsapos medical records suggested he had an issue with hypoglycaemic events during the evenings. The hearing at Caernarfon heard how Mr Williams used a diabetic pump to help manage his condition. Dr Jonathan Bodansky, a diabetes specialist did not have a clear answer on what caused the event despite a lot of time and effort examining this case.Forensic collision investigator William Gordon Saynor, confirmed that there was no evidence that either vehicle had any mechanical conditions and that the weather played no part in the collision.Acting senior coroner Katie Sutherland said the pathologist, Dr Mark Lord, confirmed Mr Jones suffered multiple injuries and his death would have been instantaneous.  Delivering a narrative verdict Ms Sutherland said: The collision was caused by Mr Williamsapos car being driven in the wrong direction due to him having a diabetic hypoglycemic event, the cause of which is unknown. Mr Jonesapos sister described him as a sensible and protective man: He was always looking out for me like a father figure. He was ambitious and highly focused and had travelled globally for work whilst single-handedly raising his son Jacob. His father said his son, a product analyst, was always very kind and had recently taken up salsa dancing having met a woman in Estonia. He said: She was going to dance classes there and he was doing it here so when they met up they could dance. He wanted to impress her, thataposs just what he was like.

Image: MEN MEDIAByGraeme Murray:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan | commentsDozens of pets have been left aposlimp, leless and vomitingapos as a mystery dog illness spreads. Nicola Jane took her lurcher along a canal towpath and he became ill only hours later..The six-month old dog contracted an infection which almost killed him for five days after the walk.A friendaposs dog which she was also exercising also became ill but managed to recover after they were exercised at Hunslet Canal., Yorkshire.The animals both had symptoms within four hours of the walk and aposseemed off.Hundred of dogs have experienced similar symptoms prompting vet warnings to avoid coastal walks. Cases have been reported at Hayling Island beach and Langstone Harbour in Hampshire, Fraisthorpe Beach in East Riding, Bridlington and Redcar beach.  Nicola, of Leeds, West Yorkshire said aposI woke up around am on night four, and just thought I was losing him. I thought he was dead, he was shaking and being sick, he was limp in my arms I thought he wasnapost coming back from this. At that point in the night I took him to the emergency vet, I was really shocked with the numbers that were there. I was terried.apos The Daily Mail reports that blood tests were carried out and the vet kept the pet overnight and monitored IV fluids.Nicola added: He is a mess, he is like a skeleton he is that skinny. He lost that much weight. There was nothing on him, no le, he was limp, I thought he was gone, I thought I was losing him. Vets told her a virus which was originally from beaches was spreading.  The animal doctors warned her to avoid the popular dog walking areas at the coast because it is spreading from dog to dog very quickly.Earlier this month The Mirror told about a more than a hundred dog illnesses which had struck down animals. Veterinary nurse Brogan Proud, who runs Yorkshire Coast Pet Care posted a message on Facebook where she said that she had been inundated with ill dogs that have been vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea.She said that local authorities were investigating what is behind the illness and that worryingly a lot more dogs have been affected than she previously thought as more people have contacted her. As itaposs gone so public, it just seems to be much higher numbers than I thought. I know the local authorities have been testing, they canapost find anything as of yetBefore that incident The Mirror reported animals had been affected in Yorkshire.Vet practices in the region then shared warnings on Facebook, urging owners to avoid beaches in Scarborough and Saltburn.The bug was then thought to be moving inland to towns and cities, including Hebden Bridge, York, and Sheffield, reported similar symptoms. One person posted on a group in Hebden Bridge saying: The dog sickness bug is spreading here like wildfire. My dog came down it on Thursday and I had only taken her to school and back! Relatives of Nicola, , have also had their dogs admitted to the vets, some for three days. Dog owners told how his Great Dane died after contracting lung infection from swimming in apospollutedapos sea water. David Arthuraposs -month-old dog Odin swam at Hayling Island in Portsmouth, Hampshire, but had to be put to down because of the infection He had already spent £, on treating Odin but the animalaposs lungs were damaged from pneumonia, with the sea thought to be the likely cause of infection. A £, vet bill faced the owner of another dog after her Staffordshire bull terrier swam in polluted sea water. Nalu was infected after swimming at Langstone which terried her owner Louisa Moss. The pooch became so ill she had to be put on a ventilator and was struggling to breathe and her owners were told she might die.

Despite this, the virus continues to be rampant and risk of infections still remains high. When someone catches Covid, their immune system usually generates a response that helps their body fight off the virus and protects them from future infections. However, some people end up getting re-infected as their immunity begins to wane.So,youaposve recently caught Covid and youaposre wondering how long you might remain immune to it before the risk of catching it again - hereaposs everything you need to know. How soon can I catch Covid again   After someone catches Covid, their bodies builds antibodies that help fight against the virus. However, itaposs not known how long immunity from infection lasts, and it can also y from person to person.A recent Public Health Englandstudy found that more people who have had coronavirus are protected from catching it again for at least five months.However, a government website states that a new infection could occur within  days - or three months - of being infected once. This would be mean that people who have the virus in October could be vulnerable to catching it again this month. Sometimes, the immune response doesnapost last as long as five or three months and people end up getting re-infected twice in one month. The Omicron iant, which has more mutations than previous iants, is thought to be more likely to cause reinfection than iants like Delta. However, UK studies are yet to look into Omicron re-infection rates in more detail. Itaposs worth noting that residual signs of Covid infection can show up on a PCR test for up to three months, evena person is not displaying any symptoms. Do I need to self-isolateIaposve already had Covid before   Yes,you have symptoms of Covid or have tested positive for the virus, you will need to self-isolate, evenyou have already contracted the virus in the past few months. You will also need to self-isolateyouaposve not been vaccinated and live with someone who has tested positive. This applies evenyou have had recently been infected, as this would be a new infection and you are considered contagious again. Guidelines from Gov.uk state: If an inidual is re-tested  days or more after their initial illness onset or prior test date, and is found to be PCR positive, this should be considered as a possible new infection.

The footage of Primrose Court in Huyton, Merseyside has racked up more than five million views.A voiceover on the video, which was created by a TikTok user scrolling on Google Street View, says: Look at the f****** state of this street in Liverpool.It shows derelict homes with their windows boarded back in September , while music from the horror film Dead Silence plays over the top of it.Residents living in the area told the Liverpool Echo they feared for their safety due to gangs torching houses and setting fires in the street.The issue of crime coupled with fly-tippers targeting the area has caused many people to move out of the area.  One man, who did not want to be named for safety reasons, told the ECHO: I feel unsafe. Thereaposs a gang - they donapost want to see this area getting better. All the time people are bringing their rubbish and they make fires. I canapost describe it to be honest with you, it looks like Beirut. Iaposm looking for a safe le, Iaposm not looking for trouble. Every day Iaposm going to work, I pay my bills. I remember one man moved in and he left after a couple of months because he wasnapost safe here. Theyaposre nice houses but for some reason, these people donapost want to see this area getting better. The problems with Primrose Court appear to have started when the development was first built by two private companies who went bust before work on site was completed. This means key elements such as street lighting and ‘proper kerbs’ have not been installed on the road. And because the road is unadopted, the duty to maintain it belongs to the owners of the properties.  In a previous interview with the ECHO, one woman who did not want to be named said she lived in a house on Primrose Court for seven years until she couldnapost take anymore. She said: It was nice when I first moved in. They were lovely houses. It went really bad around June . One family moved in and the next minute they all turned up. That was when it all went downhill. After the families moved out of the houses, which are privately owned, the woman said kids living in the area continued to vandalise them by smashing up windows. Speaking to the ECHO earlier this month, the owner of A Properties, Colin Bell, said of the  houses he manages across the region the  properties he owns on Primrose Court create % of our problems.  On average, Colin said he spends around one and a half to two days a week on the estate attending to issues and clearing up rubbish that has been left there. Colin said: All around Primrose Court there are nice properties going up and being sold immediately. The area is ripe for investment but weaposre stuck with Primrose Court simply because of the council really, I donapost know how many times Iaposve rung up asking whataposs happening or sent emails. They come back with the same thing apostheyaposre hoping to get funding.apos Of the  properties on Primrose Court, Colin said nine of the houses, which are owned by dferent landlords, are currently empty - and four of them are believed to have been derelict for over  years.Colin claims that in October , Knowsley Council promised street lighting would be installed and work on the road would be completed on the grounds that each property owner would pay towards the work. He said: Itaposs a crazy situation. Over two years ago now we agreed for the council to do the work and we would repay the council. For any of the houses that we didnapost repay, the council would repossess the houses and they would have charge of them. We were told the work would be completed in nine months - this was pre-covid. Up to now, weaposre still no further on. However, Knowsley Council has disputed these claims and said the properties on Primrose Court are all privately owned and the council never agreed to repossess them. A Knowsley Council spokesperson said: “Knowsley Council did not build the properties at Primrose Court and has never owned them. It is therefore not the case that we are able to aposrepossessapos them and we have never agreed to do so. “In fact, many of the issues at Primrose Court arise because the development was built by two separate privately-owned companies – both of which went into liquidation without completing the work on-site and without meeting the planning conditions for the developments.  This meant that the usual processes for adopting the highway, installing street lighting etc could not be followed and the same problem prevents the installation of other measures such as CCTV. The current property owners expect the Council to use a considerable amount of public money to complete a privately owned development. “The Council has been in regular dialogue with the homeowners and landlords of properties in Primrose Court since the initial issues arose in the area. The council continued: A number of Council services, including Housing, Highways, Environmental Health, and Crime  Communities, have worked with homeowners and landlords to identy solutions to the issues on site, try to identy sources of funding, and agree a collaborative approach to tackling the issues that are evident. “For example, the Council met with some of the owners to discuss co-funding highways and infrastructure improvements to bring the road up to adoptable standards. At that meeting, the owners who attended agreed - in principle - to co-fund this work. Unfortunately some of the other owners who did not attend refused to agree to contribute their shares, which would be required to progress the adoption of the road under a Private Streetworks Agreement. The Council has established how much the work would cost should an agreement ever be reached, but these costs are only going to continue to increase as time passes due to the poor original construction of the road by the developers. “Unfortunately, the Council is not in a position itself to fund all of the work which is required on site. Indeed, this would not be appropriate given that the Council does not own any housing and is not able to re-possess privately-owned properties. “Despite this challenge, the Council continues to look at solutions to tackle the issues being experienced and we are bidding for additional funding to carry out work in the area.

Emma Pennington claims raw sewage has been pouring out of a manhole in the back garden of her Stoke on Trent home for the last three days. The stench is so bad, the mum-of-one claims it is now seeping through the walls of her three-bedroom property. The flooding also means the -year-old has been unable to let her four dogs out into her own garden. Emma first contacted Severn Trent on Monday after being met with the horrying sight of buoyant excrement.But she says told the Stoke on Trent Live is still clueless about when someone is going to come to carry out the job. Emma said: “I got up on Monday to let the dogs out and I had to stop them because all I could see was flooding down the garden. It lted the manhole cover which is why there’s big lumps of faeces from the whole street. There’s still water trickling from the cover now. “The smell is horrendous outside and inside. It is coming into the house now. It stinks. How would they like it  “It’s not hygienic. How can they say that’s alright to leave somebody in  I seem to be fobbed off when I ring. “It makes me feel dirty. I walk into the house from work and it smells. “I left for work last night and I had a headache. I don’t know whether it’s connected. I don’t know what I’m breathing in. I feel sorry for my dogs because they can’t go out. Despite calling the company  times, Emma says she still doesn’t know when the work is going to be carried out which is causing her stress. She said: I rang Severn Trent first thing and was told someone would be out by pm but nobody came. “On Tuesday I rang again and nobody got back to me. I was on the phone on and off all day. “I was eventually told somebody won’t be out until Wednesday and I said it’s not good enough. I suggested that a manager should ring but that didnapost happen. “I rang the complaints number and was told somebody would be be out before .pm on Tuesday. Nobody turned up. “I still don’t know what’s happening. Nobody has told me anything.” Emma says her garden has been flooding since she bought the semi-detached property  years ago. A blockage on a nearby street is believed to be responsible, causing the neighbourhoodaposs faeces to bubble up. She added: “Severn Trentaposs service is shocking. I can’t believe I pay my water rates, I don’t even get any kind of compensation. “The water is still flowing out so there’s still a blockage somewhere. I’m waiting for them to come out, deal with the blockage and clean up. It’s disgusting. “I hardly had sleep because I’m on and off the phone trying to find outsomebody is coming out. It’s caused a lot of stress. Severn Trent has now issued an apology. A spokeswoman said: We know how distressing flooding can be, especially sewer flooding, and would like to apologise to the customer on Lambourn Place. “Weaposve got teams onsite today, providing support to the customer. It will be our absolute priority to fully investigate the sewer network to understand what’s caused the flooding, andit’s anything to do with the Severn Trent network. “Again, we are extremely sorry for the distress this has caused.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Severn Trent\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The NHS hasnapost changed its official information yet about what the symptoms of the latest strain are, and so parents are continuing to get information out about the dferences between it and previous iants such as Delta, the Manchester Evening News reports. Using their Manchester Family Facebook page, the MEN has been asking parents to share how the virus has been affecting their youngsters.At the time of writing, the official NHS advice still reports a new and persistent cough, a loss of taste or smell and a fever as the main symptoms - but read on for how parents say the virus is dfering for their kids. What Omicron symptoms have parents seen in their kids   The first thing to note is how dferent the responses were between familiesapos experiences - while some kids had little to no symptoms, others were left quite unwell by the virus. The number of hospitalisations among infants has risen during the Omicron wave, although experts are still saying that the majority of cases are very mild and that people shouldnapost panic. Data published by the Scientic Advisory Group, or SAGE, on January  said that in previous waves approximately % of children hospitalised with Covid were under the age of one. Between mid-December  and January, this number rose to %. Despite this, they say severity is still low, with SAGE saying: For the small number of children who do attend hospital, theof stay is typically short and where they stay overnight it is often to allow for screening for other infections.The most common symptoms reported on the Facebook page were a cold, a temperature and a headache. More than  parents said their kids had suffered from a headache,  said there had been fever or temperature and  reported cold-like symptoms or a runny nose. Thirty-three parents also got in touch saying there had been tiredness or that their child hadnapost had any energy and was generally sleepy.A cough was reported in over two dozen cases, and while it was mild for some, others had a rougher time of it with a similar number identying a sore throat.Sickness and stomach ache also cropped up among the responses, as did a loss of appetite and taste . Achy backs and legs, as well as general muscle aches, were also flagged. Some kids also had diarrhoea or an upset stomach, pale skin, bloodshot eyes or sneezing.

Sources say the Duke was known for being rude and having childish obsessions - as he was ridiculed while on the road fulfilling royal duties, reports claim.It comes after reports the embattled Duke of York would allegedly scream and shoutBuckingham Palace servants failed to follow his exact plan for the arrangement of his teddy bears. Now more supposed demanding behaviour has come to light during his term as the UKaposs special representative for trade and investment. It includes suggestions he was privately mocked in the Gulf during his time as a special envoy.  A diplomat says the Prince became known as HBH - His Buffoon Highness. The former deputy head of mission in Bahrain, Simon Wilson, says the royalaposs travelling entourage left people speechless. He told The Times Andrew flew out a team which included his equerries and private secretaries. His valet would be equipped with a huge ironing board to ensure his clothes were perfectly pressed, it was claimed.  The diplomat, who had previously hosted the Duke, added that Andrew was rude and boorish and wasnapost well-liked. Mr Wilson explained he was known as a buffoon because of his childish obsession with doing the exact opposite of what had been agreed. He immediately warned that Andrewaposs private le would “willy-nilly, intrude into his public role” – and that he could be “going off with Ghislaine Maxwell to a nightclub” during his private time, it was claimed.Andrew has effectively been banished from the royal family less than  hours after learning a civil sex case against him in New York will go ahead.  The latest awkward anecdotes come after Tuesdayaposs claims that Andrew sketched out a plan for how his five teddies and cuddly toys should be positioned on his bed every night. Ex protection officer Paul Page tells ITV ’s Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and the Paedophile that would “scream and shout”his servants failed to place them exactly how he wanted. He supplied a handwritten guide is said to have included two hippos, a black panther and bears, as well as three cushions called aposDaddyapos, aposDucksapos and aposPrinceapos. It showed exactly where to place blankets, as well as five toys and a fur, which had ribbons that had to hang off the side of the bed, it is said. Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and the Paedophile host Ranvir Singh unravels the story of how Maxwell sank into shame and disgrace through her friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. And will also explore how Andrew became embroiled in the scandal as he faces his own possible civil court case brought by Virginia Giuffre. Andrew has strenuously denied the allegations made by Ms Giuffre against him.

Royal correspondent Jennie Bond has spoken of the Queenaposs apparent upset after a New York judge gave the green light for a civil sex abuse trial against her second son, Prince Andrew.Pending the trial, the Queen stripped him of all royal and military titles, leaving him in tears. The Duke of York has absolutely and categorically denied all allegations. Following his relegation, the Governmentaposs Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said Andrewaposs behaviour would have caused enormous challenges for the royal family. Meanwhile, Prince Harry threatened the Home Office with a judicial review should they refuse to provide him a security detail while visiting the UK. Ex-BBC royal correspondent Ms Bond believes the Queen will be feeling the strain and in despair over recent events involving more junior members of the Firm. Speaking to OK!, Ms Bond explained: I think The Queen will be holding her hands up in despair with her children and some of her grandchildren.She added there should be equity between Harry, who was stripped of titles when he renounced royal duties in , and Prince Andrew, who should have been demoted some time ago. She said: Everybody feels for the Queen now with the Andrew debacle, but I think there has to be some equity between Harry and Andrew now. There was the argument and it probably wasnapost correct, butHarry has been stripped of his titles then Andrew should have been some time ago.. Harry also made headlines this week as itaposs been reported that he could be planning to take legal action against the British governmenthe is denied police protection when he visits the UK.The Duke of Sussex issued a pre-protocol letter to the Home Office suggesting his lawyers will seek judicial reviewcontinued police security isn’t provided by the UK when he and his family are in the country. Harryaposs lawyers made it clear he is happy to pay for the added protection It comes after Harry made a series of visits to the UK over the past year, but claims his security situation lacked continuity ,changing from one visit to the next. While in the UK to attend his granddadaposs funeral in April, bodyguards were protecting him and his family. However, when he ed later that same year in July to witness the unveiling of a statue of his late mum, Princess Diana, he was without security. A safety concern was raised after a group of photographers chased his car as he left the charity event. A legal representative for Prince Harry said the legal claim was filed in September to challenge the decision-making behind the security procedures, in the hopes that this could be re-evaluated for the obvious and necessary protection required. According to Ms Bond, Prince Andrewaposs security should be revised too. She said: If Harry is not going to be allowed to have security over here unless heaposs staying in a royal residence then perhaps Andrewaposs security should be looked at too. On the other hand, the expert says Harry should look at the le he has chosen after moving to the US. She explains: There has to be some kind of equity between the two of them but Harry needs to look at himself, heaposs chosen this way of le, he wants to be regarded as a royal citizen, and he canapost pick and choose like this. Ms Bond added that Prince Harry canapost have it both ways. She explained: He canapost be treated as a royal with all of the trimmings while heaposs over here and then swan off back to the states and say that youaposre not. I donapost think the pennyaposs quite dropped yet.Harry moved to the US in  after he and we Meghan Markle decided to step back from senior royals, and they now raise their two children - Archie and Lilibet - in Calornia.Read MoreRead MoreFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON The QueenJennie BondPrince HarryPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And at the weekend, Harry revealed the reason why heaposs yet to bring his family to his homeland. He claims his private security arrangements are not enough to ensure his family’s safety and privacy here. He and Meghan are no longer entitled to police protection.  Harry now wants to pay for specialist police protection, but the Home Office has ruled this out – and he has applied for a judicial review against the decision. If the row canapost be solved, Harry might choose not to bring his young children to the UK.And with the Queen no longer flying long-haul, royal expert Phil Dampier told The Sun itaposs a big possibility she is never going to meet her granddaughter Lilibet and has only ever met Archie once or twice.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

Harry might come over but it gives Meghan a good excuse not to come and also not to bring the children. Meanwhile, another royal expert previously claimed the Queen finds it dficult that she has been unable to see Harry and Meghan’s children.Speaking in the Channel  documentary : The Queen’s Terrible Year, royal expert Camilla Tominey says it has been hard for the Queen to be so far away from her two great-grandchildren. She said: Iaposm sure the Queen was absolutely delighted to hear the news that the Sussexes were expecting a second child. She continued: But it is dficult for the Queen. She has not been able to see Archie. I think the last time she was able to see Archie in the flesh was November . The only way the Queen will be able to see these children isthey come over to the UK.

But theyaposve had several homes together since they first started dating almost six years ago. After they became engaged, Meghan moved in to Harryaposs small two-bedroom cottage at Kensington Palace, which is just a few doors up from the Cambridge family. But after their wedding, they wanted somewhere bigger to raise a family and went to the Queen with an idea. But according to a report the pair faced disappointment when the monarch rejected the request they made about their home. According to the Sunday Times, the couple asked the Queenthey could live at Windsor Castle.  The report, written by Roya Nikkhah states: The couple are understood to have set their hearts at first on Windsor Castle, and are believed to have asked the Queenliving quarters could be made available after their marriage.But Harryaposs granny said no and gave them Frogmore Cottage instead.Hugo Vickers told the Express why the Queen may have decided to deny their request, saying it might not have been entirely appropriate.

He writes: There are empty bedrooms and suites in the private apartments within Windsor Castle which the Sussexes may have had their eye on, or perhaps some former living quarters in the castle grounds converted into other things. But I can see how it might not be entirely appropriate to have a young family living there. Before the birth of Archie, the couple moved into their Frogmore Cottage home, later than expected due to delays with renovation work. Itaposs just over two years since they moved out of Frogmore and started their new le in the US. But it has now emerged that Harry does not want to bring Meghan and their two children to the UK to visit, saying there is a lack of security. The -year-old, who remains sixth in line to the throne despite quitting royal duties in , has threatened legal action against the Home Office unless he can have police protection for his family when in the UK. He is said to be keen to bring Archie and Lilibet to visit his homeland but claims he is unable to do so. Megan and Archie have not ed to the UK since the couple walked away from royal le in , while Lilibet has yet to set foot in the country where her dad was born. Lawyers acting for the Duke of Sussex say they will seek a judicial reviewcontinued security, which he has offered to pay for, is not provided when he and his family visit.

But rather than run it herself, a maid does it for her to make sure it is to her exact preference.The author explained in the Daily Mail : While Her Majesty is enjoying her first cup of tea, her maid will go into the adjoining bathroom to draw the bath, which has to be exactly the right temperature: tested with a wooden-cased thermometer, and no more than seven inches of water. While sheaposs enjoying her soak, her dresser Angela Kelly is then said to prepare the Queenaposs outfit and once sheaposs finished her bath Her Majesty then gets dressed and fixes her hair ready for breakfast at .am.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

But why is it the Queen would prefer a time-consuming bath to a quick shower  Well author Craig Brown, who wrote Ma’am Darling:  Glimpses of Princess Margaret, once offered an answer.

Shannon Gadd, , gave birth to Fiadh Rose Hughes in November at Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital in Grimsby.She was born weighing two pounds and  ounces and requires Cow  Gateaposs Nutriprem  formula - which helps preterm and low birth-weight babies gain weight after leaving the hospital, GrimsbyLive reports. The formula is full of key vitamins and minerals to support their nutritional needs before they can start on a normal infant diet. Shannon has been unable to buy the formula because of a national shortage, which caused little Fiadh to become sick and dehydrated. Have you struggled to find formula  Email us about your story, webnews@mirror  She said: Not being on the formula is taking its toll on Fiadhaposs health. Sheaposs started to have more reflux and she also started having a tar-like bowel motion. Iaposm so worried for Fiadh because the doctor has confirmed that it’s to do with the many diet changes. The question I ask now is, how am I going to feed my baby   We’ve had to go out and get normal milk which we know makes her sick and it’s not enriched enough so sheaposs going to lose weight. I don’t know what we are supposed to do. Shannon says her formula first ran out on December  and sheaposs been struggling to find any since. The new mum said: I was told Fiadh had stopped growing two weeks prior to her birth because of a growth issue so a doctoraposs performed a Caesarean.  She was taken into the NICU for five weeks where I used breast milk in a bottle for eight weeks to give her the best fighting chance. But her weight dropped and she needed extra calories because my milk wasn’t enough for her growing appetite. I took the very hard decision to try and transition her into the formula with Cow and Gate Nutriprem  recommended. She loved it but we last ran out on December  and havenapost been able to order any since. Shannon has resorted to using a dferent formula, which she says has had a detrimental impact on Fiadhaposs development. She said: We were doing well until Fiadh took a turn for the worst on December  when she began to be sick from the new formula.  She was taking a little amount of milk and then bringing it back up so she was really hungry and upset. I was getting worried about her so I rang  and they told me to be seen by someone immediately. A doctor admitted us straight away and said Fiadh was going to need to be treated for dehydration. Shannon said: She only weighs five pounds and six ounces to this day and is below her centile - a growth chart indicating where a guideline baby should be at their age. Iaposve been told how important the Cow  Gate formula is but I canapost buy it anywhere. Iaposve been to chemists and pharmacies in Hull, Scunthorpe, Immingham and Grimsby to be told itaposs out of stock. Iaposve tried contacting Cow  Gate to find thereaposs a national shortage of this product. It feels like I’ve been passed from pillar to post without any joy. How can it be out of stock when it’s made only for premature and underweight babies  for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.A representative from Danone said: We were sorry to hear about Shannon’s story. We are experiencing some short-term, isolated incidents of low availability on our Cow  Gate Nutriprem  g powder formula product. We do appreciate how unsettling and frustrating it can be for parents to not be able to find the products they need. We are working hard to get products back onto shelves as soon as possible. We are sending out supplies of Nutriprem  g products, and these should start to be available in stores towards the end of this week. Although this may y by store and region. We have good availability of our Nutriprem  ml liquid productwhich is also an option. In the meantime, we want to do everything we can to help.

Some people will still be wary about ing to workPlan B guidance is coming to and end and some has already been scrapped Image: Getty ImagesByBenjamin LynchSEO Writer:,  Jan | comments Rules for working from home have changed once again.Boris Johnsonaposs government announced the plan after its review into the Plan B restrictions in place since December, designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus.The government hopes that the UK is now past the peak of the Omicron iant, although the number of confirmed cases have gone back up again since an apparent downward trend at the beginning of this week.Reported cases on January  had fallen to ,, the lowest since December. However, over , cases were reported on January . This is still nowhere near the beginning of January, when cases were well over the , mark, but is not an encouraging sign as the government lts restrictions. Plan B brought in restrictions like working from home, so can we now go back into the office  Do we still have to work from home   Work-from-home guidance ended with immediate effect, the Prime Minister announced in a statement to the House of Commons on Wednesday, January . This means that people are now able to go back into the office when previously they were discouraged from doing so since Plan B was put in place on December .  The PM said: From now on, the government are no longer asking people to work from home. People should now speak to their employer about arrangements for ing to the office.Leader of the Labour PartyKeir Starmer said in response that the opposition approved the plans as long as they were based on evidence.He said the PM must reassure the public he is acting to protect their health, not just his job. Can your company force you to go back to the office   If your company requires you to come into the office, they can only make youyour contract stipulates working in an office. Citizens Advice said: You can ask to keep working from home, but that doesnapost mean your employer has to agree. Start by having an open conversation with your employer about your wishes, and consider making a flexible working request. However, employers are also duty-bound to make the work environment as safe as possible, so they should consider minimising visitors and improving ventilation, as well as considering the use of one-way systems and extra cleaning. The Trade Union Commission, meanwhile, had firmer advice people may want to considerthey do not feel safe at work.It said: If your boss is asking you toto the workplace or stay at home and you don’t feel comfortable, you should speak to other members and your union rep immediately - they may feel the same about the situation. If you raise the issue collectively with your employer, they’re much more likely to listen. What  has changed   Plan B restrictions were originally due to expire on January . As well as the work-from-home guidance, the PM announced that face coverings would no longer be required in school classrooms from January . An unnamed director of public health at a city in the north of England said they have some concerns about the change of rules in classrooms.They told: This feels like more of a political decision than a decision based on the evidence and the science, and it could be quite London-centric.I worry the decision has not been made for the right reasons. From January , face coverings in indoor public places will no longer be required and venues and events will no longer be required by law to use NHS Covid passes.Venues can choose to impose the use of passesthey choose to do so.Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: Today marks the start of the next chapter in this country’s fight against [Covid].But it’s not the end of the road and we shouldn’t see this as the finish line.

The incredible scenes were snapped at one of the fast-food chainaposs restaurants in Borehamwood, Herts.Normally, drivers in cars are seen ordering grub from the drive-thru, but many were understandably left baffled when a woman and her steed joined the line of vehicles waiting.When she got to the window, she dismounted and told the employee what she wanted, Bristol Livereports. Her horseaposs snout was then seen hilariously poking its snout curiously into the window - probably trying to inspect the aromas of McDonaldaposs food. The woman was then seen trotting on with a coffee in one hand as she chatted away on her mobile phone. It is unclear whether she ordered any food for her steed or decided to keep their diet to carrots and hay. Incredibly, it is not the first time McDonaldaposs customers have seen someone ordering from the drive-thru on horseback. In December, dad-of-three Simon White saw the hilarious event unfold while stopping to eat at his local McDonaldaposs in Caerphilly, Wales.The woman stood in the queue, paid at the first window and then collected her meal at the second while Simon,  took some photos of the bizarre incident. His pictures show the woman in a mustard puffer jacket and riding boots sitting on a white horse and joining the line as though nothing is out of the ordinary. She holds her purse in her hand, ready to pay for her snack, and then pays for her food while perched on her horse. The horse appeared to not be phased and waited for her to finish patiently, and the two rode off after the staff members give her her meal.

Then I passed her on the road where she was eating the burger. My son loved it, it really made his day - he was laughing so much. I thought it was really funny as well - itaposs something you just canapost imagine seeing unless you live in the Welsh valleys.

The -year-old already on articial le support was a registered organ donor and his family had agreed to the pioneering op on his behalf. Surgeons say within a decade other pig organs such as hearts, lung and livers could be given to humans needing transplants.  Senior author Dr Jayme Locke, of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said: “This game-changing moment in the history of medicine represents a paradigm sht and a major milestone in the field of xenotransplantation, which is arguably the best solution. “We have bridged critical knowledge gaps and obtained the safety and feasibility data necessary to begin a clinical trial in living humans with end-stage kidney failure disease.” It comes weeks after the first pig heart was transplanted into a living US patient and three months after the first single kidney was transplanted in to another brain dead patient.  In this latest op ten key genes that would have led to the kidneys being rejected were knocked out in the genetically modied donor pig. Mr Parsons’ ex-we Julie O’Hara, and their children, Ally, David and Cole, made the decision, along with his sisters and mother.  Ms O’Hara said: “Jim was a never-met-a-stranger kind of guy who would talk to anyone and had no enemies - none. “Jim would have wanted to save as many people as he could with his death, andhe knew he could potentially save thousands and thousands of people by doing this, he would have had no hesitation. “Our dream is that no other person dies waiting for a kidney, and we know that Jim is very proud that his death could potentially bring so much hope to others.” Kidney disease kills more people each year than breast or prostate cancer and pig organs could soon be given to patients suffering end-stage kidney failure.  Mr Parsons’ family gave permission for the four hour procedure to go ahead at the university’s Legacy of Hope Donor Recovery Centre. The kidneys filtered blood, produced urine and, importantly, were not immediately rejected. They remained viable until the study was ended,  hours after transplant. Mr Parsons was a registered organ donor. He had longed to have his organs help others upon his death - but they were not suitable. So he was maintained on a ventilator to keep his body ing. His native kidneys were removed, and replaced with the pig’s. Dr Locke said: “Mr Parsons and his family allowed us to replicate precisely how we would perform this transplant in a living human. “Their powerful contribution will save thousands of lives, and that could begin in the very near future. “Mr Parsons’ gt honours his legacy and firmly establishes the viability, safety and feasibility of this preclinical model. Because of his gt, we have proposed this to be known as ‘The Parsons Model.’” The Food and Drug Administration in the US has approved the use of genetic modication of pigs for this type of research. However rules in the UK are much stricter and would currently prohibit such work. It involves the setting up of specialist facilities where pigs can be bred genetically modied to tweak, silence and add key genes that would reject key organs such as the heart and kidney. The results pave the way for a Phase  clinical trial at Alabama for patients with end-stage kidney failure. Dr Locke added: “A radical solution is needed for the organ supply crisis. The domestic pig is a promising organ source.” Pig heart valves are already widely used in humans. The natural lespan of a pig is  years, they are easily bred and have organs of similar size. Genetically modied pig kidneys have been extensively tested in non-human primates. The Mirror has campaigned for six years to increase organ donation and successfully lobbied the Government to introduce a “deemed consent” system in England in .The NHS Blood and Transplant says matching more human donors remains the priority for now.A spokesperson said: “There is still some way to go before transplants of this kind become an everyday reality. “While researchers and clinicians continue to do our best to improve the chances for transplant patients, we still need everyone to make their organ donation decision and let their family know what they want to happenorgan donation becomes a possibility.” The findings are reported in the American Journal of Transplantation.

As tensions continue to soar, with Russian troops massed at the border, the US issued the defiant warning to Russia against any action last night.The statement was made shortly after US president Joe Biden predicted that Russia would invade the country.In the statement, White House press secretary Jen Psaki publicly warned of the response Russia will meet in the case of an invasion and added that even action short of a military invasion will be responded to. Russian aggression, including cyberattacks and paramilitary tactics, would be met with a “decisive, reciprocal and united response, it added.  US President Joe Biden said he thought that Russia will invade Ukraine, adding: My guess is he will move in. He has to do something. Russia will be held accountableit invades - and it depends on what it does. “Itaposs one thingitaposs a minor incursion and we end up having to fight about what to do and what to not do, et cetera.  “Butthey actually do what theyaposre capable of doing ... it is going to be a disaster for Russiathey further invade Ukraine. Russian officials have repeatedly denied planning to invade Ukraine, despite having , troops stationed near the Ukraine borders. Russia has long tried to exercise leverage and all-out control of Ukraine, an area many in the country believe belongs to them - they call Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, the mother of Russia.  Press secretary Psaki said: If any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border, thataposs a renewed invasion, and it will be met with a swt, severe, and united response from the United States and our allies.” Republicans expressed concern about Bidenaposs remarks. Republican Senator Rob Portman said: Any incursion by the Russian military into Ukraine should be viewed as a major incursion because it will destabilize Ukraine and freedom-loving countries in Eastern Europe.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Joe BidenJen PsakiEastern EuropePoliticsUkraine crisisRussiaVladimir Putin\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Georgia Pontin from Kettering in Northamptonshire first started working for the clothing giant on the weekends after college, back in July .During her time there she learnt a thing or two about the running of the store and a number of insider secrets, which she now shares on her TikTok @pontasaurus .Georgia first went viral on the app after she posted a video revealing what it was like working there and the best ways to shop in the store as a customer. Since then she has posted  more videos on the subject, growing her a following of more than , fans. So, we have compiled some of her best store secrets, so you can get the most bang for your buck. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Why the clothes are so cheap Primark is loved for its bargains, but apparently, thereaposs a reason why the clothes are so cheap. Georgia explained that the store doesnapost play any music to keep costs down. By not playing music they donapost have to pay any licensing fees which helps keep the cost down, and to be fair Primark is loud enough as it is so you wouldnapost even hear the music, she said. Where to find hidden stock Georgia explained how both staff and shoppers would hide their favourite pieces in strange locations around the store when new releases arrived, as these items quickly run out of popular sizes. However, most customers forget they put these items away – so itaposs always worth a look whereyouaposre struggling to find a size. The ex-employee recommends starting with corners of the shop and lower racks, especially in the nightwear section. All the popular stuff goes very quickly, she said. The most popular sizes, which are ,  and  will go and once theyaposre gone, theyaposre gone. But sometimes people are undecided about a piece of clothing and will hide it in case they want to come back and get it. They almost always forget about it but sometimesyou check right at the back of the rails that are still quite full, some people hide stuff there. And in corners of the store. Since a lot of people glance over areas that are in front of them, the corners of the store are sometimes the most forgotten about. There was one particular corner in the pyjama section, on the lowest rack, where people would hide stuff. When I used to work and I saw something I want to buy on my break, I would put it in that corner too and come and collect it when I was on my break. Donapost worry, Iaposm pretty sure my managers knew I did that. It was so hard to not spend all your money in there since we worked around the clothes all the time and saw the items as they first hit the shelves. What to doyour size isnapost in stock Itaposs so annoying when you find something you like but you canapost find it in your size. While many of us might just accept that itaposs not meant to be, there is something  you can do. Georgia said: If you find something you really like but they donapost have your size in stock at one store, then you can ask one of the members of staff to call another store and seethey have it. Obviously you would have to go and pick it up, they wonapost deliver it to the store but itaposs something to think about. Now thereaposs no guarantee that a staff member is going to do it for you, but itaposs always best to checkyou really want this product. Why you should wash the clothes before you wear them This one isnapost so much of a secret Georgia says, but an important reminder. When you buy your clothes and you take them home, please wash them the first time you wear them. Like every other retail store,someoneaposs ing something or theyaposve tried something on in the fitting room, it doesnapost get washed after theyaposve tried it on. You have no clue what that other person has been doing, what theyaposve been wearing, where theyaposve put their clothes - so please wash the clothes. Sometimes when I used to work there, weaposd get clothes back and weaposd check them over and they had stains on them and only then we can determine whether we sell it or not. If we choose not to sell it then it would go to the faulty bit butwe do sell it, then itaposll be a reduced price - so thataposs the risk that you have to take. What the bells mean If you ever hear three rings on the bell, be careful – it signals that there is some form of emergency going on. Georgia said: The bells ringing in Primark have dferent meanings. One ring is to alert the floor staff that help is needed on the tills, two rings are to alert supervisors and site managers, and three rings is to signal for an emergency. Despite some unfortunate experiences with unhappy customers, Georgia thoroughly enjoyed working at Primark. She added: I loved working at Primark. My first job as a waitress was awful and put me off working in food forever. When I heard a Primark was opening up at the new shopping complex, I jumped at the chance. Since I started from the beginning, everyone was in the same boat and we all saw what the store looked like without any clothes or stock in. They brought in staff from all over the country to help us set up so we knew what we were doing. How to get first dibs on clothes in a new store If you have a new Primark store opening up in your area, this is how to get first dibs on the clothes in there, Georgia says. So I started working at my store when it first ever opened and we had a staff only night just before it opened. You got to see it brand new, you got to see all the new stock, you got first dibs on the popular items and all the popular sizes... At the event, you can bring friends and family so they can see everything too and they can buy stuff first as well. Soyou have a new store opening up and you know someone thataposs gonna work there then thataposs how to get first dibs on all the items in the shop. When to avoid shopping Georgia explained that each store has a prime time which is their busiest hour. So at the store I worked at, our prime time was pm and during that time, anyone who wasnapost on break or lunch had to be downstairs on the shop floor. Because it got so busy we had to go behind everyone and fold everything, put things back and make sure it was all neat, or at least weaposd try to. Often during that time thataposs when the queue is longest. While queueing is inevitable, Georgia suggests going during off-peak periods so you can get served quicker.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

After forking out £ a month for a houseshare in central London, he decided to see what other options there were to avoid extortionate rents.But with London property prices even higher - he decided to use his savings to buy a -year-old Dutch narrowboat for £, in September .He then spent over a year doing renovations for an extra £, including labour costs, and now lives on the water in Cookham, Berks.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Along with his girlfriend, Ellie Williams, , he pays a £ mooring fee a month, along with a boating licence and insurance for roughly an additional £ per month. The average selling price of a flat within central London is well over £ million, meaning the couple has saved a huge fortune by investing in a home on the water.Lloyd said: “Renting in London was just ridiculous, I was paying £ a month for a room in a house share, and wouldnapost know where to begin with the price to buy outright.It made more sense for me to buy a barge to live on. Mooring at Cookham costs £ monthly, plus a boating licence and insurance for roughly an additional £ per month.“After that, the only other major running cost is coal for the stove, big bags are less than £ which usually lasts a few weeks.It isnapost just utility bills Lloyd saves on, but the renovation too.Lloyd managed to save on some labour costs by doing a lot of the work himself with the support of friends and family.He adds: “I had a welder install an extension on the stern and bow to give us more space, as well as creating that open plan effect.“I stripped the entire boat back to the metal frame, I was a bit hesitant at first, but with it being such an old boat, I wanted to make sure it was completely rust and rot free.“I had all the windows replaced with double glazing and installed a skylight for £ as well as painting the inside of the boat white to make the boat look airy and bright.“All of the frames and walls I constructed myself, as well as the bed but had to do a lot of shuffling around when I got the  litre water tank installed.“There were plenty of ups and downs during the renovations, and I definitely learned several new skills.“All the hard work has definitely paid off, I love the freedom that boat le gives you.”Despite the high cost of renovations, the couple have managed to snag a few bargains and freebies along the way.Ellie, an accountant from Derbyshire, said: “We bought a fridge on Facebook Marketplace for £, which fits everything we need and is certainly an upgrade from Lloyd’s original wine fridge. We also got some spare mattresses from friends that we turned into cushions with plenty of comfy filling.“We have a charity shop coffee table for working from home, but we’re hoping to build a proper workstation from scratch soon.“We both really love plants, so have filled the boat up with them, creating plant pots with old painted food tins.“Lloyd’s mum also gted us some lovely small painted decorative pieces.Lloyd added: “With the plants, skylight and open plan space, it really feels like we’re living outside. How do you save money  Let us know: mirror.money.saving@mirrorAfter living in ‘Julia’ for just under a year, the couple has had to make a series of compromises due to their minimalist living.Lloyd said: “It was definitely hard making the transition from living in a house share to living on a boat.“We’re completely reliant on solar power, so try and keep the fridge off with fewer daylight hours during winter, because they don’t charge up so quickly. We put things in a cool box instead.“Shower time also has to be limited as we’re not plugged into a water supply and we try not to use the washing machine on board.Ellie added: “I rent a flat in London for the time-being, so we pop in there every so often with all our laundry. “We’ll definitely miss that luxurywe both commit to living on the barge full-time.“I really miss having long showers, and they usually have to be less than two minutes so Lloyd will jokingly put a little egg timer on whilst I’m in there.Despite the compromises the pair have had to make, they have both fallen in love with river living and are looking forward to travelling around come summer, before eventually selling up.Lloyd said: “It’s incredible waking up on the river every morning and embracing the sounds of nature as well as viewing the sunrises.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON House pricesproperty news\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts from our Property Market newsletterSubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Alicia Stoddart was staying at her parents apos caravan at a holiday park when the mystery flying object triggered the sensors, leaving her and the kids absolutely gobsmacked.Mum Alicia, , and kids -year-old Millie, Layla, , and Danny, nine, were all absolutely baffled by the winged fairy-shaped object that fluttered towards the camera before flying over the roof of the caravan. We are convinced it’s the tooth fairy. Millie said it’s definitely a fairy, Alicia said, adding: My dad said aposWeaposre all away with the fairiesapos.  The family, who hailed from Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire, were holdaying at a caravan park in Clacton, Essex, last Sunday when the magical sighting took place. She said: We were sat at my parents’ place looking through the ring doorbell footage and there it was. My first thought was aposOh my God it’s a fairy.apos We were racking our brains trying to think of what it could be and googling possible culprits. But none were matching the outline and size of the image. We then called my brother and sent him the video to see what he thought and straight away he shouted aposWhat, no way, It’s the tooth fairyapos. Construction business worker Alicia added: I later showed my children and even though they are slightly older this video has certainly made an impact. My son is a believer of all things magical and to see actual footage of a tooth fairy, when he has a wobbly tooth, couldn’t be more amazing.

Her son, Jan Rek, lashed out at anti-vaxxers in central Europe for influencing his mother and her decisions. Horka, , was lead singer for Czech folk group Asonance an Jan explained that he and his father, who were both vaccinated, caught Covid over the Christmas holidays. Horka purposely remained in close contact with them both, which led to her catching the virus. Jan also revealed his mother’s final tragic moments before she passed on Sunday. The -year-old remained in good enough health on the morning she died to get dressed for a walk.  But she complained her back was hurting and went to lie down in her bedroom.In an interview with the BBC, Jan said: “In  minutes it was all over. She choked to death.”Horka is thought to have believed thatshe caught the virus, she would not need the vaccine.  Jan explained that while his mother was unvaccinated, she did not subscribe to any of the conspiracy theories around the Covid vaccines. Jan said: “Her philosophy was that she was more OK with the idea of catching Covid than getting vaccinated. Not that we would get microchipped or anything like that.” She celebrated upon learning she had contracted the virus.  Her family said she was “happy” to have Covid because she thought it meant she could obtain a health pass to visit venues those without proof of vaccination or recent recovery are blocked from going to. On her social media just two days before she tragically died, she wrote: “Iaposm very happy about it because in this way I would be able to start having a free le like everyone , and go back to the cinema, on vacation, to take a sauna, to the theater. “I survived… It was intense. So now there will be the theatre, sauna, a concert… and an urgent trip to the sea.”  Jan was left raging with anti-vaxxers in his country who he blamed for her death.On Facebook, following his mother’s death, he wrote: “You took my mother, who based all her arguments on your basis.“I despise you, you are an absolute waste.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Coronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Robin and Gavin were accidentally given to the wrong mothers by a nurse at Nigel Hospital in Johannesburg where they were the only two babies born on that day in February .This meant Robin was raised by single mum Sandy Dawkins who was struggling to get by on the outskirts of Johannesburg while Gavin grew up with wealthier parent Megs Clinton Parker in Pietermaritzburg. The mistake was not uncovered until two years later when a disagreement over Gavinaposs rightful father led to a DNA test revealing that Megs was not his birth mother.  Hospital records further confirmed that Robin was Megsapos biological son who was growing up with Sandy as his mother. When faced with swapping their birth sons back, Megs and Sandy chose to keep the children they had raised since birth. Speaking nearer the time, one of the parents told  Minutes Australia: You canapost reject a child that youaposve been so close to for two years. Initially I think you protect the one youaposve got. The first few days are shock, then the curiosity comes. Whereaposs my baby   The boys grew up km apart in very dferent environments and referred to each other as brothers. But Robin has since admitted that he wishes his biological mother fought to switch him back. Speaking at age , he said he had dficulty accepting the situation and misses his mother Megs awfully a lot who he speaks to daily on the phone.  He told how le with Sandy was not easy and that he resented Gavin who does get things easy. If Iaposve ever wanted something, Iaposve had to work towards it. I’ve never just had it come towards me, he added. At the time, Gavin described being “happy” with the le he was accidentally given and that he did not feel sorry for Robin. He said: “Saying I thank my lucky stars every day would be wrong but at the same time I was given a le which I’ve now lived and I’m still living and I don’t regret anything.  The boysapos mothers embraced one another like sisters after discovering the mistake in  but chose not to swap the boys back. But Megs missed her biological son and encouraged him to move halfway across the country to her home with Gavin in , leaving Sandy without a child.

At : GMT on January , the asteroid made its closest approach to Earth since , coming within . million miles of our planet.The clip was captured by Gianluca Masi, manager of the Virtual Telescope Project, at the Bellatrix Astronomical Observatory in Italy. A still from the footage, comes from a single, -second exposure. The telescope tracked the fast apparent motion of the asteroid.  This is why stars show as long trails, while the asteroid looks like a sharp dot of light in the centre of the image, marked by an arrow. The space rock was first discovered in . It orbits the Sun every  days. The last known approach this close was in  when it was , miles from the Earth.  Masi said: We captured several images of the potentially hazardous asteroid PC while safely approaching us. “Using all the images of the sequence, we could make the animation below, showing  PC in motion against the stars.’” NASA estimates the diameter of an asteroid as , feet, much larger than the tallest building on Earth, the Burj Khala in Dubai, which measures , feet.  Following its close approach on Tuesday, won’t be this close to Earth again until the year . NASA and other agencies regularly track more than , known asteroids as they orbit the Sun, and occasionally cross Earth’s orbit - none of the known asteroids is expected to collide with the Earth at any point in the near future, but there are asteroids whose orbits aren’t known.

Lainie Chait is taking her former employer to the Fair Work Commission, after she says she was sacked for choosing to get vaccinated against coronavirus.But wellness business, the Church of Ubuntu, where Ms Chait had been working since October , claims she was just a contractor.Ms Chait, from Byron Bay in Australia, worked for the Church of Ubuntu’s wellness clinic remotely for one year. The Church claims to be a religious order, who help people and animals struggling with health issues. Ms Chaitaposs lawyer, Mark Swivel, said she didnapost consider herself a member of the church, she was actually simply doing a job for the church. Ms Chait says it was important for her to get vaccinated against Covid-, since she has been living with epilepsy for  years. However, she didnapost think this would mean losing her job. I knew their stance on health, and I aligned with all of that, but I didnapost realise the political agenda that they had about this kind of thing, she told NBN News.  She is now seeking damages, as she claims she was sacked once her boss discovered her vaccination status. The unfair dismissal stems from a simple argument that the employer sacked Lainie when she chose to be vaccinated, Mr Swivel said. When I was hired for the job there was nothing I was talked through to tell me this was a potential outcome, Ms Chait said. Their constitution states they support all health habits and things people do to support their own health, so theyaposve gone against their own constitution, she added.  In a letter to Ms Chait, the church wrote: It is the position of the COU that to receive the COVID- Sars Cov  injection consciously and deliberately with intent is in contradiction with our Constitution and contrary to our position on what is required of us by our Lord God and Creator.Ms Chait’s case comes amid a debate in Australia over the governmentaposs proposed Religious Discrimination Bill and the power of religious organisations to hire and fire based on belief.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EpilepsyCoronavirusCoronavirus vaccine\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

company.Murray will be fully kitted out in Castore sportswear throughout the US Open championships, as he was for Wimbledon earlier this summer. In fact, the three-time grand slam champion has helped design his matchwear. He said: \"I work with the AMC designers on every piece, with technical performance at the heart of the process. \"Its important that the kit performs under the toughest conditions. \"I really enjoy testing it, giving it my feedback and being part of the design process.\"The AMC designs aim to combine \"the respective brand ethos of Andy Murray and Castore, created to deliver a new standard in tennis performance clothing on and off the court,\" according to the brands website. People can shop the range online, including Murrays own on-court look. Who  do Castore

“pork pie plot” by Johnson’s allies – named so because the meeting in which a group of Conservatives mutually agreed to submit letters was led by Alicia Kearns, a Tory MP who represents the town of Melton, home of Melton Mowbray pork pies. Kearns has denied leading any such plot.Tory MPs present at the meeting told Thethat they had discussed submitting letters of no confidence together, in a move that would push Johnson into an even more of a politically vulnerable position. If % of Tory MPs write to the chairman of the backbench committee – currently Graham Brady – a leadership challenge is triggered. As there are currently  ConservativeMPs sitting in Parliament,  Conservative MPs would need to submit letters to the  Committee to trigger an automatic leadership vote.: School letter about Boris Johnsons effortless superiority resurfacesThere is much inconsistency surrounding the reported number of MPs who have officially submitted a letter of no confidence. This morning, it’s been reported that  members of the  “Red Wall” elected Conservatives have handed in a letter. However, some Tory whips have reported that the number of total MPs to have submitted one is somewhere in the “twenties”.While inidual MPs are free to make it knownthey have submitted a letter, the  Committee keeps the actual number of MPs who have submitted one close to its chest. So far, Sir Roger Gale, a long-standing Tory backbencher, has announced that he has already written a letter and Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross has made it known that he will be submitting a letter today..removeWhat is the  Committee Officially known as the Conservative Private Member’s Committee, \"The ” is an influential backbench of Tory MPs. The group was originally a private dining group, made up of new Tory MPs elected in the  General Election – where it takes its name. The group has grown to become an important ball part of the system that Conservative MPs use to express views on party leadership, and now plays an important role in the election of a leader to the party.: When and how did Boris Johnson become Prime Minister The committee adjourns weekly while parliament is in session, previously to talk through views and opinions without the presence of the frontbenchers – although since  frontbench Tory MPs have been made welcome to attend. In summation, the committee as a collective represents the views of the Tory Party to the party leader without the fear of being reprimanded by Cabinet members as they are not “formal” members of the party.Who is on the Committee The elusive committee is normally made up of  members. Since prompting the resignation of Margaret Thatcher in the s, they have been colloquially dubbed “men in suits”, an allusion to the power they hold \"behind the scenes\" in Parliament.

That aside, it was a strong year for the driver.Argyll rally fans are looking forward to a full  season, Covid permitting, in conjunction with Dunfermline Car Club and the new main title sponsors Burnside Piling.CAPTIONS:Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen CR MAX.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files january 7 2022","story":"Machrihanish and Islay topped the highest gusts of wind recorded in the west of Scotland on Tuesday.Throughout the early

speed-related accidents.Argyll and Bute Council#s roads director Alistair Gow told councillors that use of both fixed and portable cameras to detect speeding had increased dramatically in the last few years.They had been pioneered by the former Strathclyde Regional Council which had paid for their purchase and installation with the police meeting the running costs.From the limited information available, an average drop of  per cent in injury accidents was being achieved where they were being used in the UK.#A substantial proportion of injury accidents within Argyll and Bute are speed related and in view of the above statistics, remote speed enforcement could substantially reduce the occurrence of accidents of this nature,# he said.#There are other types of equipment available which are not intended to operate as enforcement tools, but instead to convey a visual message to speeding motorists. This equipment has the advantage of raising driver awareness of the technology available, without the need to proceed with enforcement.#Councillors agreed that officials should investigate the ious forms of remote speed detection equipment, in consultation with Strathclyde Police and the Scottish Office, as trunk roads authority, and report back.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe New Year in Campbeltown was celebrated quietly at the weekend.Apart from a few breathalyser tests, police said the town was remarkably quiet.

Nobody was hurt.The breathalyser appears to have retained its purpose.All the burgh#s taxis were kept going non-stop over the Christmas and New Year period and operators reported heavy bookings.The West Coast coaches were also well used by people who sensibly left the car at home.Shops were kept busy during the few festive days and licensed grocers sold big amounts of the #cratur# and other alcoholic drinks.Christmas and New Year Day babies expected at Craigard Maternity Hospital failed to arrive and the staff had a quiet time of it.A large crowd of people of all denominations and from all over the country converged on Carradale House, home of the authoress Mrs Naomi Mitchison, to take part in the New Year celebrations.This was the rd time that Mrs Mitchison had played host to a large number of guests at Carradale.Politicians, government workers, farmers and fishermen all mingled together, danced, sung and sampled an excellent buffet.Many Carradale villagers were also present.Addressing the guests, Mrs Mitchison talked about the effects of the Common Market and fishermen.

I note that Maureen McGarry-OHanlonmakes no mention of the fact that SNP policies have resulted in the highest level of education investment in the UK, and Scotland has, proportionally, more schools than England or Wales and more teachers per pupil than can be found in England and Wales.Teachers are also better paid in Scotland, with a starting salary of £,, while in Wales it is £, and in England, £,, outside Greater London.Improvements to education have seen Higher passes at a record level since devolution began, and the percentage of school leavers going on to further education, training or employment has increased under the SNP Government. And of course, in Scotland, university education is always based on the ability to learn, not the ability to pay.Ruth Marr, StirlingAN ATTACK ON FREEDOM OF SPEECHNADINE Dorries has brought into the glare of the spotlight her partys vindictive vendetta against one of our revered national institutions, the BBC .For a fairly long time there has been the drip-drip of a hostile narrative directed at this noble Reithian organisation from a right-wing perspective to downsize it and to cut its national funding.There was no attempt to disguise the Culture Secretarys delight in making the announcement that the BBC must now consider joining the modern world in becoming a subscription service, likely to reduce it to an underfunded public broadcasting service and to undermine its place as the national broadcaster which displayed no bias, fear or favour in its examination of the issues affecting the nation.It has been labelled by the right wing as a leftist-leaning organisation and as a right-leaning organisation by the left, depending upon who is in power at the time.All around us we are witnessing the closing down of the liberal traditions which once graced the UK and we are experiencing the straitjacketing of our options in dferent areas. Freedom of speech, freedom to protest and freedom to think for ourselves are gradually being whittled away. That is what the attack upon the BBC amounts to.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.* JOHN Birkettcompares the salary of the Director-General of the BBC with those of the Prime Minister and the Chief of the Defence Staff. This is not comparing like with like. It would be more appropriate to compare with the salary of the chief executive of ITV. In , Dame Carolyn McCall’s basic salary was £, after a voluntary % reduction. If the BBC were looking for a new DG, it is this salary that applicants would be comparing the £, with, not the PM’s salary.As for the “ludicrous” pay levels for presenters, news readers and so on, it is dficult to compare these with the payments offered by commercial television since ITV is not required to, and does not, publish the amounts it pays.Billy Grierson, Perth.DOG EAT DOGI WONDER who chose the moniker of \"Big Dog” for the project to save the Johnson premiership  Might I suggest “Clever Dog” as a better alternative  Any dog owner will tell you big dogs aren’t necessarily what you would want in a tricky situation.My Jack Russell would run rings round this guy.Thomas Law, Sandbank.SMILE, PLEASEI AM pleased that Andy Murray is doing well at the Australian Open but could somebody please tell him that the wide-open mouth is not a good look for the camera  A modest smile would make him look more like Roger Federer and give us a more attractive front page photograph .

We believe it is key that these tests remain free to those using them, and we will oppose any attempt by the UK Government to remove them while the public health need for them is so clear.  “The Scottish Government pays for lateral flow tests via funding arrangements as part of the UK-wide national testing programme.” "},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"January ,  at : pmA new mobile operating theatre is to enable almost  elective surgeries to go ahead for Orkney and Shetland patients.

You’d expect the crowd to be like that. I can understand it’s a gentleman’s game but it’s about time that people embraced some sort of dferent energy in this sport otherwise it will die out. It’s just that simple.”Medvedev, who next faces Dutchman Botic van de Zandschulp, hopes coming through Thursday’s match will stand him in good stead for the rest of the tournament.“I can say it’s definitely an unlucky draw,” he said. “But these kind of matches, first, second, third round of a slam, it’s like a big challenge where,you make it, you feel like, ‘OK,I can continue playing like this, I can go far’.”Kyrgios had not played a match since September going into the tournament and was in bed with Covid last week but showed once again what a phenomenal talent he is. vw,vw,px, px\"Stefanos Tsitsipas reached round three He said: “I’m incredibly proud of my performance today.

If I play  per cent of people tonight on that court, I think I win.”Regarding speculation that this could be his final year in the game, Kyrgios said: “I don’t know what I’m going to be doing in a year’s time. I’m probably playing tennis, but I don’t know.”Fourth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas did not have things all his own way either against Sebastian Baez but finished strongly to win --- -.

Now we need the points and then alsowe score one goal more than our opponent, it is OK,” Ranieri said with a smile.“This is very big. It was big against Newcastle, another crash between two teams who want to stay in the Premier League, and we need the support of our crowd.“We need the passion, we need everything and I am sure we do a very good match.”Both sides enter the fixture with a sht in momentum after Joao Pedro’s late goal at St James’ Park on Saturday saw Watford halt their slide, while at the same time, Dean Smith’s Norwich were beating Everton by a - score.It moved the Canaries off the basement and up to th, only one position and a single point off the Hornets, who are yet to drop into the relegation zone this season despite winning only three times in the top flight this term.Ranieri added: “Yes of course, we have to win but we don’t want to lose.“This is a very important match for us, for them and it is also a very good match for the Premier League.“Norwich come with a lot of confidence after their win against Everton. We come with good thoughts, confidence and very happy after we drew the match with Newcastle. I think it will be a very good match.”Watford were due to visit Burnley in midweek but Tuesday’s clash against another fellow struggler was postponed.It means the th-placed Hornets have more time to prepare to face Norwich, which is their last game before the Premier League goes through a mini-winter break with the ision set to resume on February th.Ranieri floated the idea of Watford trying to fit in their game with Burnley during the next two weeks, adding: “I am not so frustrated  because when you play, you have to play every two or three days and this is not so good.“Now I hope when we play against Burnley, I hope there are some days more to recover from another match.“I don’t knowwe play the fth  and after we play on the eighth. It would be a little crazy while we have a week free, so we can maybe play a little early ”Seven players will miss Watford’s match with Norwich with Imran Louza, Adam Masina and William Troost-Ekong still away at the African Cup of Nations, while Peter Etebo , Kwadwo Baah , Nicolas Nkoulouand Ismaila Sarrremain sidelined.The Vicarage Road outfit have already been active in the January transfer market but have been linked with Bordeaux’s Samuel Kalu and Liverpool defender Nat Phillips.Ranieri insisted Kalu was “not close  per cent” and while he expressed his admiration for Phillips, the experienced boss conceded the Hornets needed to move players on before trying to bring in the centre-back.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

said.Paul Givan said, while he would support the removal of mandatory certication entirely, he anticipated a majority of ministers in the powersharing administration will back proposals to retain the mandatory system in higher risk settings.Mr Givan’s comments came ahead of a meeting of the Executive on Thursday afternoon.Laws requiring people to prove Covid status to gain entry to a range of hospitality venues and large-attendance events were introduced last November. vw,vw,px, px\"Covid certication has proved controversial in Northern Ireland The move proved politically contentious with Mr Givan’s DUP party voting against the scheme while the other four Stormont Executive parties backed it.Patrons wishing to access nightclubs, pubs, restaurants and other licensed premises have been required to provide proof of vaccination or a negative lateral flow test result or evidence of a previous Covid- infection.The same rules have applied for entry to large indoor and outdoor events, such as concerts and sporting events.The PA news agency understands that ministers are considering proposals that would see the legal requirement for Covid certication remain in place for nightclubs and indoor unseated and partially-seated events with  or more attendees.However, for all other settings where certication is now required, such as restaurants, pubs and cinemas, the legal requirement would be replaced on January  with guidance to “strongly encourage” the continued use of certication.Nightclubs have been closed in Northern Ireland since December  as part of a series of restrictions agreed on December  in response to the Omicron iant.Ministers also imposed fresh measures on the rest of the hospitality sector, including aof table service and a ban on dancing.Ministers are expected to announce the removal of the December restrictions after Thursday’s meeting. vw,vw,px, px\"Nightclubs have been closed in Northern Ireland since December  This is anticipated to be part of a phased approach to the lting of remaining Covid restrictions in the region.PA understands the measures under consideration by the Executive envisage one phase this week and one next.From January , the requirement for table service in the hospitality sector and the “rule of six” on table numbers would be removed.Guidance to keep domestic indoor gatherings limited to three households would also be lted, though gatherings should still be limited to  people in total.In regard to face coverings, the requirement to provide proof of exemption would be removed and the reasonable excuse of “severe distress” would be reintroduced.Earlier this month, Mr Givan already announced the rule to make people prove they were exempt had been suspended.Mr Givan announced on Wednesday that the self-isolation period will be cut from seven to five days on January .Under phase two of the proposals, from January  nightclubs could reopen and indoor standing events could resume. vw,vw,px, px\"Northern Ireland First Minister Paul Givan The prohibition on dancing would be lted.The changes to Covid certication are also earmarked to January .In workplaces, the requirement for office-based workplaces to take reasonable measures to have two-metre social distancing would be removed, with guidance remaining that risk assessments should still be carried out.Ahead of the meeting, Mr Givan said he hoped the Executive would make decisions around easing hospitality restrictions when it met on Thursday.Speaking during a visit to Londonderry, he said: “We are understanding where Omicron is in our community, in terms of pressures it is creating in our health service and we have a much more positive picture now which gives us the room to take decisions today.“I am hopeful we will be able to make changes to hospitality, to nightclubs in terms of the prohibition on dancing.“I believe that later today we will have made signicant progress in a number of areas.”Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said that while the pandemic was not over, she believed Northern Ireland had passed the peak of Omicron. vw,vw,px, px\"Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill She said: “The pandemic is far from over but we are cautiously optimistic.“We believe we are through the peak and we believe we have some space now to be able to reverse the protections that we put in place over the course of the last number of weeks.“It is a positive picture but I would ask people not to be complacent yet, we still have a journey to travel.“I do think after our Executive meeting we hope we will be able to say positive things that will be welcomed by both iniduals and also by the hospitality sector.”The outcome of the deliberations on Covid restrictions is to be announced at a press conference in Londonderry on Thursday afternoon.It is understood that, under the proposals being considered, remaining restrictions and guidance would be reviewed at a Stormont Executive meeting on February .Those include:– Legal duty on the retail sector to take reasonable measures to reduce transmission risks.– Legal requirements on wearing face coverings and associated duty on businesses to ensure mask compliance.– Legal requirement for Covid- related risk assessments.– Legal requirement for taking track and trace details from customers patrons.– Remaining legal requirements for Covid certication.– Working from home guidance.– Guidance on taking lateral flow tests before meeting up with others.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with

So much of what we learn in terms of socialisation and relationships does not happen in a classroom but across all the other day to day activities and interactions that take place.“It is a huge issue. Our young people have lost a lot in terms of their formal education but for me, they have also lost a massive amount in terms of the other areas of development that their education brings.”Portree High School pupil Luke Eveling, who has published a book about facing mental health challenges as a teenager on Skye, believes the pandemic had taken a toll on his age-group.He said: #Lockdown and the pandemic more widely definitely had an effect on young people in school. A lot of my friends are finding it hard to cope with exams and more broadly the pandemic simultaneously. This has influenced how well they are doing at school.#I have a few friends who have turned to serious drug abuse as a way of coping with the combined pressure, and others have stopped going to school completely.”In April , Luke bravely shared his own challenges through his book ‘A Series of Essays About Mental Health’.Within the book, Luke, who lives in Broadford, wrote frankly about a wide range of issues including heartbreak, peer pressure, drug abuse, and suicide. at the time, Luke talked about being diagnosed with Asperger’s and coping with isolation during the pandemic.While last year Luke spoke warmly about the “overwhelming support” he had received from family, friends and the wider community after opening up about his own circumstances, he believed more support services should be made available to help other young people.He added: #There are some, but there just isn’t enough for everyone. Things like having a school counsellor sound good but just don’t seem to reach everyone who needs help.#Councillor Finlayson added: “We know the importance of mental health # people are nervous about the pandemic and have not been able to socialise as before. We already have and will continue to have a situation where some young people will really struggle to get back to being with their peers and to sustaining positive relationships.“Parents are rightly concerned. Their children are in a totally unique situation given the global scope of the pandemic and the impact it has had and will continue to have on how education is delivered.“Supporting all aspects of education in its widest form needs to be a priority for all levels of government from the UK Government to Scottish Government to local government.“We all need to realise that the young people who have been in schools for the last two years have been disadvantaged in many dferent ways.“We need to take account of this going forward in terms of additional resources and possibly a catch-up curriculum and perhaps even more importantly, support for all aspects of young people’s health and wellbeing including mental health.”Assessing the lay of the land in schools across the region, Councillor Finlayson said: “Within Highland we will be continuing to follow the rules and mitigation measures that were in place previously and have come from the Scottish Government # all these things masks in classrooms, social distancing, ventilation in classrooms, limiting contact with other year groups and classes as much as possible will continue. What the rest of the country will be expected to do.“Better ventilation is being encouraged in schools # but we must consider the time of year and the fact that some of the schools within the Highland Council are pretty antiquated and not in the greatest condition.“I am keen that schools should make decisions that suit their own circumstances # because each school is dferent.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/annie-johnston-with-John-Lorne-Campbell.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais a visit to canna south uist and barra in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineI have drawn on an intermittent diary kept at the time, to help with my present memories of the occasions., was by any standard a memorable experience.Campbell, a leading Gaelic scholar already well known internationally, had from the s carried out ground-breaking fieldwork recording Gaelic oral tradition in the Hebrides and in Gaelic Nova Scotia.

In fact, I’d argue the opposite is true - I’m very secure and confident in my unionist credentials.”A spokesperson for the UUP said the party has selection processes and “every aspiring candidate has to abide by the same processes”.“Andy entered the selection process and was interviewed as part of it,” continued the party. “Ian was also interviewed and he emerged as the successful candidate.“Ian Marshall is a positive, confident unionist who is committed to strengthening Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom.“We are sorry to see Andy leave the party and we wish him well for the future.”Related topicsUlster Unionist PartyMore On Ulster Unionist Party PremiumMen dominate at top of police, politics and the health service PremiumDonaldson has to stop threats to bring down Assembly: Long PremiumDouble jobbing plans a ‘thoroughly bad idea’, warns chair of Northern Ireland Affairs CommitteeVideo: NI public mostly opposed or ‘sitting on fence’ regarding ‘double-jobbing’ proposalsBig names could help DUP fend off strong opposition in key constituenciesMost ReadArlene Foster thought ‘for most of weekend’ about Cavan teen who took his own le after being bullied because dad was ProtestantJozef Puskareplied ‘no’ when charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy, court toldDUP’s Donaldson rejects he’s ‘angry’ over scrapping of double jobbing, as Michelle O’Neill welcomes ‘about turn’Belfast republican ‘Dee’ Fennell acquitted over illegal procession after video evidence could not be played due to password issueAndy McKane leaves UUP after decision to select ex-Irish senator Ian Marshall for Stormont electionTop VideosPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayVideo: Northern Ireland leaders break ground for new Derry hotelLatest PoliticsNI Covid rules for hospitality and vaccine passports will ‘hopefully’ be relaxed, says Paul Givan as Stormont Executive meets todayBoris Johnson clings on as Sue Gray’s party report due next week… under-fire PM vows to fight any vote of no confidence after senior Tory tells him ‘in the name of God, go’Liz TrussOpinionThe NI Protocol must be changed to help protect the hard-won peace hereMen dominate at top of police, politics and the health servicePhrase has been on the go since LatestIndoor ski centre law change bid gathers pace after boy’s ‘avoidable’ deathKate jokes her dog will be ‘upset’ after she enjoys cuddle with therapy pupBlair criticises ‘attacks’ on BBC amid licence fee debatePM’s study into Scotland-Northern Ireland bridge cost taxpayers £,Patrick Bamford’s Leedsdelayed by foot injury,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is understandable that there are concerns around receiving the vaccine.

is expected to start shortly on a major internal upgrade at Ballynahinch Community Centre.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has drawn up plans to reconfigure the internal layout of the Windmill Street facility as part of a signicant investment initiative.Local people are being asked for their views on the planned upgrade which could be completed as early as the summer and cost in the region of pound,.Confirmation that work is to start soon on the centre upgrade has been welcomed by Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen, who has also thanked Strangford MP Jim Shannon and her council colleague Billy Walker for their support in driving the renovation programme forward.She revealed that she had been contacted by a number of residents about the slow progress of the scheme and is pleased that everything is now on track.In addition to the planned work at the community centre, consideration is also being given to investing around pound, to finance internal alterations of the local authority-owned Market House in the town centre.And the Recorder understands that consideration is being given to providing an ultra-modern G sports pitch at the Langley Road playing fields with the adjoining sports pavilion also in line for a major upgradeA number of politicians have been lobbying for the local authority to address what they described as the organisationrsquos ldquounder investment in Ballynahinch and ensure that enhancing leisure facilities is a critical component of its future investment plans.Council officials had previously been asked to examine the potential of extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.However, they have opted to commit pound, on a major upgrade of the existing complex which will include a reconfiguration of the internal floorspace in a bid to increase the buildingrsquos usage.Politicians say they are keen to work in partnership with council officials and the Ballynahinch Community Collective to improve sports and community provision in the town to meet the needs of a wide range of people.Elected representatives say Ballynahinch needs to be at the heart of planned investment in future leisure provision across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.Politicians are keen to ensure that Ballynahinch does not miss out when it comes to leisure provision investment, given the money that has already spent in other towns across the council area.They believe that the good working relationship that exists between elected representatives across the Rowallane area can ensure that Ballynahinch does not miss out on future funding opportunitiesand that the needs of the townrsquos community are met, particularly when it comes to modern leisure, sports and community provision.Politicians want Ballynahinch to be included in any future strategy when it comes to leisure activities and provision, warning that the town cannot afford be left behind.They say the current community centre requires a much-needed upgrade with the current proposal a major step in the right direction.Elected representatives say that given the local council spend on major schemes in other parts of the district, the ratepayers of Ballynahinch deserve nothing less than an upgrade community centre and investment in other parts of the town..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19_January2022_Winterwatch.jpg","title":"BBC Winterwatch TV show airs live from

And as well as their cultural signicance the implications for the economic and tourism attraction of the historic centre of the county are obvious.They add: ldquoWe call on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to halt its current direction of travel and demonstrate a commitment to restoring what was an internationally recognised centre of excellence in Downpatrick.ldquoWe ask it to respect its moral responsibility to honour the trust placed in the museum by those thousands of donors and friends who expected the council to cherish and support this public treasure house of the shared histories of County Down.Last week a spokesperson for the council said it was ldquocommitted to the continuous improvement and development of its museums.The spokesperson also said a meeting was held in December with stakeholders and elected representatives to clary there would be a reduction in ldquostaff head count following the restructuring.ldquoFurther engagement with stakeholders is planned for early this year and we look forward to working with all our partners to advance the councilrsquos ambitious and exciting plans for our museum services, the spokesperson added.See Letters on pages  and ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19_January2022_Down.jpg","title":"Down go under against Antrim  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo disappointing start to their Dr McKenna Cup campaign continued when they lost out to Antrim by two points in Newry last week.The defeat means back-to-back losses for James McCartanrsquos new-look side, despite some encouraging inidual performances throughout from the Mourne outfit.Down will count themselves unlucky not to gain anything from the contest, having gone tit for tat with the Saffrons in the first half and Barry OrsquoHagan seeing his last gasp goal bound effort ricocheting over the bar instead of hitting the back of the net.McCartanrsquos men got off to a dream start when the newly ed Niall McParland sent a long ball forward into the hands of Ryan OrsquoHiggins, who opened the scoring through a well struck goal just three minutes in.Ruairi McCann and Odhran Eastwood confidently kicked over frees to bring Antrim within one point of levelling the scores before Packie OrsquoHagan doubled Downrsquos lead just before the  minute mark.Antrim did manage to completely reduce the deficit before the first water-break, with two quick-fire scores coming from Patrick McBride and a Pat Shivers free.As the players rehydrated, the surrounding supporters at Pairc Esler were awarded time to catch their breath as the fast paced game was momentarily brought to a halt.Veteran Darren OrsquoHagan entered the fray in the place of John McGeough upon the resumption before James Laverty kicked over a point from play to give the visitors the lead for the first time in the match.A well worked attack ended with Kevin McKernan levelling proceedings once again for the hosts, and soon after captain Caolan Mooney fired over between the sticks to give his side the advantage.Things began heating up in the cold weather, with plenty of firm challenges on show.Anytime the Mourne side were edging ahead, Antrim were right on their coattails and were now starting to overpower the home side in dferent areas of the pitch.Antrimrsquos McCann kicked over two unanswered points, the first from a rsquorsquo and the second from a free, although Downrsquos sharpshooting Barry OrsquoHagan restored parity in a matter of seconds.With three minutes to the interval, McCann converted his fourth free of the night to give the Saffrons a one point lead.Half time: Down - Antrim -.Down boss McCartan made his second change of the night in the form of Ross Carr swapping out Josh Connery to help give his county a dferent option at the back, although they conceded their first goal of the contest a minute into the restart.Patrick McBride duly converted a fisted effort past Downrsquos Rory Burns after Antrim team-mate Jamie McCann powered his way through the home defence.Down responded positively, splitting the sticks three times unanswered with scores from a Barry OrsquoHagan free and a brace of points from play through McKernan and Darren OrsquoHagan.After over ten minutes without a score on the board, Antrim finally kicked over the bar through Michael McCann.Causing further problems for Down, McCann proved important at both sides of the pitch when he managed to catch lsquokeeper Burnsrsquo attempted rsquo to rule out any chance of a goal.At the second water-break, the home side trailed by two with it all still to play for as both sides made changes.Barry OrsquoHagan took the mark and knocked over a brace of frees to level the scores but once again, Antrim would not be deterred and replied with a point from play by substitute Conor Murray.As the clock ticked down the next few scores would be vital in deciding the outcome and unfortunately for the home support they wouldnrsquot be given much more to cheer about.With two minutes of regulation time to go, Patrick McBride struck over what looked like an insurance point for the Saffrons.As the official announced three minutes of added time, Down pressed high in search of that crucial goal to share the points.With one last opportunity awarded to Down in the form of a free, Barry OrsquoHagan stepped up to fire his effort towards the net.However, the ball would have to travel past a sea of Antrim bodies that had smartly piled across the goal line.Agonisingly, OrsquoHaganrsquos effort smashed off the opposing Antrim wall of defence before clipping the crossbar on its way over to give the visitors a dramatic victory.Down: R Burns P Fegan, B McArdle, G Collins J Connery, N McParland, J McGeough A Doherty, L Middleton R OrsquoHiggins , C Mooney , C OrsquoRawe B OrsquoHagan , P OrsquoHagan , K McKernan Subs: D OrsquoHaganfor McGeough, R Carr for Connery, T Prenter for P OrsquoHagan.

I look forward to ing soon and continuing to work on our shared interest in completing the windmill park project and heritage centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19January2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Speed sign reinstated in Saintfield in bid to halt speeding drivers  ","story":"WORK has started to reinstate an electronic speed indicator sign at the Ballynahinch Road in Saintfield.The sign mdash one of a number erected across the district by the arearsquos Policing and Community Partnership mdash was removed last year after concerns were expressed about its original location at the busy road.Designed to put the brakes on speeders, the signs have proved effective in a number of locations with plans to install more of them over the coming months.The reinstatement of the Saintfield sign has been welcomed by Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen, who said that it will make drivers more aware of their speed at this busy road.A decision to relocate the Saintfield sign was agreed by a sub-committee of the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership.Cllr Owen said she was delighted that the speed sign was being erected as it will remind drivers of their speed as they approach the built-up town centre area.Cllr Owen also thanked residents who helped her lobby for the reinstatement of the speed indicator sign following its removal.The Ballynahinch Road is one of the districtrsquos speeding hot spots with a number of high speeds recorded by the previous speed indicator sign located in a mph zone. It was revealed last May that one driver was clocked travelling at an incredible mph in the mph zone in Saintfield at am.Figures released by the PCSP over the past year have revealed that speeding in built-up areas across the district continues to be a major problem.In addition to the Ballynahinch Road in Saintfield, other speeding hot spots include the Strangford Road in Downpatrick and South Promenade in Newcastle.The Dundrum Road in Clough is a new entry on the list following the installation of an electronic speeding device on the approach to the village, while the Downpatrick Road in Ardglass is another new entry on the speeding hot-spot list.The highest speed recorded in the mph zone in Clough was mph at am, with the highest speed at the Strangford Road mdash where a mph limit is in place mdash was mph. This offence was detected around am.Since the speeds recorded by the electronic devices have been made public, politicians have expressed their shock at the behaviour of those who continue to break the law and have appealed to them to slow down.Erected as part of a major offensive on speeding drivers at a number of well known speeding hot spots, the speed indicator devices are being hailed a success as speeds in most areas where they are located are reducing.However, concern remains about the behaviour of some drivers continuing to show a blatant disregard for mph and mph speed limits in place.Recent figures published by the PCSP revealed that the highest number of speeders in Castlewellan and Killyleagh were detected around am and pm respectively, with those who hit high speeds in Ardglass detected at pm.While Clough recorded the highest speed, a detailed examination of the figures reveals that five drivers went through the mph in the village at mph, with % of all drivers travelling in excess of the speed limit.In Downpatrick,  drivers were detected at over mph in the mph zone, with one driver clocked at mph in the mph zone at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan. The highest speed recorded at the mph zone at the Downpatrick Road in Ardglass was mph.Policing and Community Safety Partnership officials say that figures recorded across the districtrsquos speed indicator signs for the most recent three-month period shows an overall speed reduction of around six percent.The number of drivers clocked at over mph across the  speed indicator signs spread across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area was almost , while the average number of speeding violations over mph was %. The average number of speeding violations over mph in mph zones was almost %..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13393831.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolsand the wider Catholic school community are extremely concerned at the choice of words used by UUP leader Doug Beattie MLA when he declared the “need to end educational apartheid”.[In a press release last Friday he had declared: “We need to end educational apartheid which is taking place here. We need a single education system in Northern Ireland that allows them to do that.”]Catholic schools and many others across the education sector firmly reject the use of this inflammatory language as they work tirelessly to promote a shared educational landscape.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.CCMS categorically rejects the very idea that Catholic schools are isive or that they stand in opposition to an inclusive and erse education system.Catholic schools promote the dignity and worth of every human person the purpose and value of education the relationship between education, family, and the local community and the purpose and meaning of le itself.The terminology used by Mr Beattie is not helpful and is representative of the misconception that schools that do not have an integrated status are not welcoming and inclusive, particularly given the long-standing work that has gone on in not only Catholic schools but rather all schools to promote shared education. The one-dimensional and isive ‘segregated VS integrated’ dichotomy suggests that there is only one way forward, namely making all schools ‘integrated’.There is in fact a wide spectrum of approaches to break down barriers, end ision and promote a unied, strong society. Catholic schools and others continue to work together to realise this ideal.I would welcome the opportunity to share with Mr Beattie the context of Catholic schools in Northern Ireland, their vision and purpose and the important role that Catholic schools exercise in educating and enriching the lives of everyone in their host communities.Equally, I would encourage Mr Beattie to discuss with both myself and colleagues across the education sector the positive changes that many governors, principals, staff, children, and young people have cultivated in their communities through shared education programmes and partnerships across Northern Ireland.Catholic schools firmly believe that no child should be left behind.Our vision is to enable all young people to meet their full potential, through access to a high-quality education irrespective of location, socio-economic background, ability, or gender.Catholic schools wish to cultivate an education system which guarantees all children will be equally supported to fulfil their potential.The challenge for all of us is to build a fair and respectful society. Education and all of our schools have a very important role to play in progressing this vision – maintained, controlled, integrated, Irish medium and grammar.However, this can only workwe all continue to work together and in this regard the label of educational apartheid is extremely unhelpful.– Gerry Campbell is Chief Executive of CCMSMore from the News Letter: Click here: Higgins in spotlight over political neutrality ahead of major Bloody Sunday event following ‘sectarian NI state’ comments from organisers Click here: VIDEO: Move to rename Prince Andrew Way – one of four such roads in Northern Ireland – as mother shreds his royal status Click here: VIDEO: The most stunning photos of Northern Ireland from the air – as taken by the PSNI helicopter squad over the last year Click here: WATCH: Odd speech by chief NI Protocol negotiator Liz Truss shows her enraged by imported cheese but overjoyed at pork marketsA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

An MP elected to Stormont, or vice versa, has to relinquish one of the two seats.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The government planned to amend this rule so that an MP elected to Stormont could hold on to their Westminster seat until the next general election. This was seen as an attempt to help Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who has been stymied in his bid to lead the DUP from Stormont. Under present rules,he becomes an MLA he will have to surrender his Lagan Valley seat, triggering a by election. The DUP is favourite to win such a contest but the unionist vote might split three ways and Alliance is strong in the constituency. Under the plans, a by election would not be needed. But the proposal caused uproar. The Labour Party, which in fact mooted the change months ago, saw how the wind was blowing and turned against it.All the main rival parties to the DUP had jointly opposed it.And then, yesterday, Boris Johnson revealed he did too, and had decided to bin the proposal, leaving Sir Jeffrey humiliated . The public is said to oppose double jobbing but there was little sign it did. Supporters of all parties routinely voted for politicians with dual mandates. Once a ban was introduced in NI, it should have been akin to that in Scotland, where election victors can hold on to both seats until the next election. But a belated moved to bring NI into line with that rule looked like an inappropriate bid to help the DUP. But the proposal,implemented, would be much less bad than the special dispensation given to Sinn Fein to get expenses while not taking their MP seats. There is no cross-party opposition to that deal. The prime minister’s sudden u-turn, when he is under huge political pressure, will remind the DUP of his unreliable nature.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

All Rights Reserved. WARNING: This picture must only be used to accompany PA Feature SHOWBIZ Film Reviews.“The Strand has a lot of similarities to the Troxy, the same architect. It feels quite nostalgic watching it in a picture house whenever you’re looking at another cinema from the same era.”Although the film’s UK release date is given as Friday , special screenings will take place in Belfast tomorrow evening before opening across Northern Ireland on Friday. Mimi said the film had generated a lot of interest prior to its release: “We’ve seen a lot more interest than we normally would.“People are really interested and intrigued, I think people hold Kenneth Branagh in such a sense of pride. He has given back an enormous amount to our creative industry in Northern Ireland, championing what he considers his home town.Strand Arts Centre CEO Mimi Turtle looks ahead to the UK cinema release of Sir Kenneth Branaghs Belfast film“The audience are interested, particularly those middle-aged and senior, who will remember the era.”Jude Hill plays nine-year-old Buddy, a role based on Branagh himself, in the film which also stars Jamie Dornan, Ciaran Hinds, Caitriona Balfe and Judi Dench as members of Buddy’s family.It is set at the beginning of the Troubles, but violence, although occasional, is not to the fore in the film.Mimi said: “I think the Troubles is more of a backdrop. It’s incidental to the characters.“There’s definitely a sense that it’s written for a global audience more than a Northern Ireland audience.“It’s got that nostalgia, that wholesomeness which the American love about all things Northern Irish or Irish.”She added: “This is just one person’s story, one person’s memory and obviously stories and narratives change with memory.“It’s that kind of sepia, rose-tinted view that comes whenever you have memories.“Because it is set here I know Kenneth Branagh and Jamie Dornan have said in interviews that they are more nervous that people here will enjoy it and accept it.”Of the staggered release which has seen the film open in America and other parts of the world before the UK, Mimi said: “It is unusual because of pirating for a film not to have one international release date.“People here will already have seen the film, but not on the big screen as it was meant to be showcased.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It was a part of the annual events: the Rugby Schools Cup final was on Saint Patrick’s Day, some of the Irish regiments recognised it, indeed the Orange Order at one time recognised Saint Patrick’s Day.“So it is something I think we need to recover, and we need to encourage full participation in the Saint Patrick’s Day celebration. These developments in the council’s Cultural Strategy do provide for more outreach work, and for more development work. They provide for more longer term planning, and they will reap rich rewards, and create a truly inclusive celebration from which the city can benefit.”The council’s ten-year cultural strategy, “A City Imagining” outlines a new approach in delivering St. Patrick’s Day events from  onwards with a three-stage process being used to assess applications to deliver pilot projects this year.A council report recommends the commissioning of Beat Carnival and The Duncairn, to deliver pilot projects in March  with funding of £, and £, respectively.

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It’s not easy to play against the crowd. I feel like these matches, they are not easy to play, but they stay as fun matches afterwards, because in the end we gave the crowd a big show.

are through the peak and we believe we have some space now to be able to reverse the protections that we put in place over the course of the last number of weeks.“It is a positive picture but I would ask people not to be complacent yet, we still have a journey to travel.“I do think after our Executive meeting we hope we will be able to say positive things that will be welcomed by both iniduals and also by the hospitality sector.”The outcome of the deliberations on Covid restrictions is to be announced at a press conference in Londonderry on Thursday afternoon.It is understood that, under the

She was always full of le and the leaders and minister were always sure of getting a big hug from her.Suzanne joined the Star of David Accordion Band at the age of five following in the footsteps of her dad and two sisters. Her band family meant the world to her. She began on the triangle, then learned the accordion. Her dad George said: “She always harped on to the bandmaster, the late Davy McKeown, to let her be the leader and finally he had to give in and let her. She always led the band with a smile.” Suzanne was also a member of Portadown Swimming Club and the Dolphin Club. From the age of six she competed in a lot of competitions and winning many medals. She continued her love of swimming through to her career as a leguard. Suzanne was involved in St John Ambulance for  years. She joined Portadown Cadet Division at the age of  and gained her Grand Prior Award, the highest award for a cadet. When she was older she became an Officer in St John. Her dad, two sisters and her brother were all involved in St John Ambulance for many years and devoted their time and commitment to the local community.Other clubs she was involved with during her childhood were St Mark’s Scouts and the Baptist Youth Club.Suzanne adored family holidays, particularly trips to Blackpool in her childhood. Her father said: “During the evenings in the hotel Suzanne was always entertaining the guests with her talent of dancing. The guests and staff loved to see her entertaining. We then spent a number of our family holidays in Florida, all together. She loved Florida and in  she got married there.”She worked as a le guard at Cascades for  years but was medically retired due to her ill health. Her husband Joab said: “Suzanne’s job was her le and she was very proud of everything she achieved. Whilst working at Tannaghmore Gardens Farm she loved having responsibility and was trusted to lock up the farm in the evenings, She also enjoyed driving the farm vehicles to collect food and also enjoyed giving school tours around the farm.”Suzanne’s illness first started when she was six. She was diagnosed with encephalitis - at the time they thought it might be a brain tumour. She was on medication for a while but otherwise was pretty healthy. Later in le she was diagnosed with epilepsy but that didn’t stop her having a fun active le.She became ill again in  - only this time it stopped her from working at the place she loved, Cascades.Over the next number of years her health was to deteriorate.

Throughout her long illness Suzanne never let it get her down. She was always smiling.Her father said: “She went into hospital on Saturday December  on what we all thought was one of her routine admissions but sadly we did not expect what was to follow and she passed away in ICU  in Craigavon Hospital on Tuesday, December , . “We have to thank all the staff in AE,  North,  South, and especially Consultant Daryl Stewart and all his team who worked tirelessly over Suzanne’s final days in ICU. Their compassion and care was second to none and we will always be so grateful for that.

Her mum and dad gave her a day as she didn’t like getting dirty and was always turned out neat and tidy. But she loved the farm and the animals. On many occasions she would bring young animals home like baby ducks and even, once, a baby pig. Having finished her day’s work, she got a call later that night to say that a cow was calving. She went to the farm with her sister Tracey and helped deliver the calf. Suzanne had been toldit was a girl it would be named ‘Silverwood Susy’ but it was a boy and she was so disappointed. When she went into work the next day the cow had another calf during the night. It was white and a girl so it was named ‘Silverwood Suzy’.

We also visited Florida on a few occasions before getting married in Florida just after Valentine’s Day on February , .“We were delighted on the birth of our daughter Nikhita in April  and settled down to family le. We called ourselves the three Musketeers. Suzanne was amazing and her smile was something special. She was the kindest person ever and would have gone out of her way to help anyone. She was a fantastic mother to Nikhita and step mother to Craig, Ryan and Sophie. She was a devoted we to me and I can’t express the love we had for each other through good times and bad times. “During last summer in July we went up to Bloody Bridge in Newcastle. Suzanne was very unsteady on her feet and she said for us to go on ahead. I was having none of it and I carried her up the mountain so she could enjoy the day with us. She was so happy and we had so many things planned for  and her th birthday. “Nikhita and I are heartbroken as is the whole family circle but we will work together as a family unit to bring up Nikhita so her mother Suzanne would be proud.

The Coleraine DEA councillor explained she had attended a meeting with Ulster University staff at the Vice Chancellor’s office accompanied by Councillor McCaw and Stewart Dickson MLA, the Alliance Economy spokesperson. She proceeded to thank Councillors Joan Baird, William McCandless, Stephanie Quigley, Helena Dallat O’Driscoll and Dermot Nicholl who offered her support on the matter before asking: “Who are the council officers currently in contact with at the University of Ulster regarding the Riverside in order to progress the situation or indeed keep the lines of communication open to receive information after the review is over ”Julie Welsh, Head of Community and Culture confirmed that she had been in contact with Gary Clarke, the university’s Head of Commercial Services and that Desima Connolly, council’s Arts and Development Manager had submitted a couple of requests to set up a meeting with the management team of the Riverside before Christmas. However, at this stage they were awaiting responses from the university.At that point the chairman, Councillor John McAuley, allowed Councillor McQuillan to have his say and as Alderman Boyle also attempted to speak the DUP councillor said: “There’s a foreign station coming in there Chairman, mute her.” He then asked Ms Welsh why council were chasing the university adding: “Surely it’s up to them to come to us, set out their stall and tell us what they are going to do then ask us for whatever they are looking for. If that was a community group, we don’t chase after any community groups to give them money.”Ms Welsh explained: “It was discussed in a council meeting and it was decided we would contact the university and ask them to come to council to present to us in terms of where they were at with the Riverside Theatre. They also indicated to the council that they would come back to us in January so I was following up.”Proposing ‘that we leave it and the ball is back in the university’s court’, Councillor McQuillan turned his attention to Alderman Boyle.He said: “Can I also ask Councillor Boyle, she named a whole line of councillors, who did she ask from our party  Alderman Boyle replied: “Your own party was the first in line, along with your MLA to be liaising with the Riverside about the situation.”Not satisfied with the response, Councillor McQuillan continued: “I don’t think you heard my question Councillor Boyle, I asked you, who did you invite from our party to attend with you  So basically you are saying you didn’t invite anybody from our party, is that what you are saying Alderman Boyle added that she had invited people, who in the past had expressed an interest in the council supporting the theatre.Continuing to pursue the matter, Councillor McQuillan stated: “Chairman, Councillor Boyle is quite clearly not going to answer the question but we all know what she is saying and that’s she didn’t invite anybody from our party to attend the meeting with her. This is the Alliance party who is fair and square to everybody except for the DUP.”At that point Sinn Fein Councillor Sean Bateson interjected saying ‘this is turning into a farce’ to which Cllr McQuillan responded “Is that another foreign station coming in there chairman ”Joining the debate, Cllr Cara McShane made her feelings very clear.“I felt extremely uncomfortable by the comments from Cllr McQuillan in light of the events on this island in the past week,” she said. “I would call out misogyny when I hear it and there were misogynistic comments made to Cllr Boyle about a foreign station and mute her.“I think it is repulsive and for it to come from an elected representative. I feel so uncomfortable and I will just say to clary what Cllr Boyle was trying to say was she invited an Alliance delegation, there was no other political party with her delegation.“I don’t understand how Cllr McQuillan can’t hear that properly but it’s very clear to me that’s what happened. There was an Alliance delegation and then she mentioned three or four other representatives who had supported what she had been calling for and had shown empathy. It wasn’t a cross party delegation.“I am just disgusted by those comments by Cllr McQuillan at the beginning of his input or contribution. It is absolutely abhorrent, disgusting and repulsive.”Committee chairman DUP Councillor John McAuley said: “I can clary that Cllr McQuillan made the same comments about a ‘foreign station’ when Cllr Bateson spoke. I don’t think he was being misogynistic in any manner but the point has been noted.”Stating the importance of supporting the university UUP Alderman Joan Baird turned her attention to the comments made by Cllr McQuillan.She said: “I do want to make a point and it’s following on from the attitude we’ve just seen towards a councillor, a lady in this Chamber. “We should have respect when speaking to a Member in the Chamber and all Members should show that respect, especially when speaking to a lady in light of the shocking murder that has happened in Tullamore. We really do need to think about what we are doing and change our attitudes.”The committee chairman allowed his party colleague to speak again on the basis he ‘was wanting to clary some of the comments’.Cllr McQuillan said: “I thought we were all equal in this Chamber and we were fit to debate without being called misogynistic or anything .“I take exception to Cllr Baird saying we are against the university, nobody said we were against the university. I asked why we were chasing the university for funding when we don’t do that for community groups or anybody . “That’s big from Cllr Baird who voted against the new McDonalds and voted against The Range coming to Coleraine on the Planning Committee. So I’m taking no lectures from her on anything in this Chamber.”Responding to his comments, Ald Baird said: When I’m chairing the Planning Committee I do it in a professional fashion using statutory legislation.
