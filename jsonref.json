Dating back almost 1,600 years, archaeologists discovered that the human remains belonged to people who had come from all over Europe to lay to rest in rural WalesAnd they also discovered that the people had lived into their mid forties, which is considered to be relatively long for that period of time. \u0027It is old for the period, its a will lived life\u0027, Dr Rovira told the publication.As many as 34 skeletons were found directly underneath college, when work on its £20million building programme began, while a further 54 were unearthed when a link road was built next to the college between the town and the A55.The remains were discovered buried alongside Roman artifacts, including a 2nd century AD Roman coin as well as a Celtic brooch.          They also discovered that the people lived into their mid forties, which is considered to be relatively long for that period of time         The remains were discovered buried alongside Roman artifacts, including a 2nd century AD Roman coin as well as a Celtic broochDr Rovira, said: \u0027It could be that it just happened to be on the soil at the time of the burial and fell into the grave, or it could have been purposely placed with her, as some sort of family hairloom.The 4th to 8th century, around the time these skeletons are believed to have been buried, was a period of great political turmoil in Britain.In AD410, faced with invaders on the continent, the Roman Emperor Honorius is said to have told Britain to \u0027look to its own defences\u0027.He pulled out the legions abandoning the island and leaving the romanised country in Chaos.         Experts were puzzled to find the mass grave included more females than males Angles, Saxons and Jutes then began landing along the coast, sailing over the north sea, and by AD500 had penetrated deep into Britain.There is likely to have been regular conflict as they competed with the Romano-British for land and resources. It is also the time that the early medieval kingdoms of Mercia, Wessex and Northumbria, among others, begin to emerge.         A Roman coin was also found with the human remains which was found by archaeologistsAnglesey is said to have passed under the influence of Dublin and received Irish settlers, which are today evidenced in round house foundations left on the island.Following a conflict with Irish rulers however, according to traditional tales, the island is then said to have headed in its own direction. Talking about the discovery, college CEO Dafydd Evans said it was \u0027extraordinary\u0027.\u0027Once the experts have completed their work, the college will be working in partnership with Anglesey County Council so that these discoveries can be seen by the public at the nearby Oriel Ynys Mon gallery and museum,\u0027 he said.             Dozens of skeletons discovered under Welsh college - Wales Online"},{"url":null,"title":"Pair spinning friend swing make stomach CHURN","story":"Share this article In a nail biting moment, the swing seems to stand still mid flight before not quite making it up and over. The girl swings back down on the same side. But her ride is not over yet as her friends again begin to push her. While the girl seems to be enjoying herself this \u0027revolutionary\u0027 way of playing on a swing is not one most parents would condone.          In a nail biting moment, the swing seems to stand still mid flight before not quite making it up and over "},{"url":null,"title":"Porcelain bowl sat shelf years sells 200 000 18th century origins uncovered","story":"Share this article The small blue and white bowl flew at auction with \u0027fierce telephone bidding\u0027 seeing the item quickly surpass experts\u0027 estimates of £20,000 to £30,000 and selling for ten times that amount, £220,000.Auctioneer Ivan Street from Aldridges of Bath told the MailOnline that the owners of the precious bowl had had \u0027no idea\u0027 at the lot\u0027s true value. He said: \u0027I came across this bowl during a routine house-call, to a lady who lives near Bath and was preparing to down-size. \u0027Although neither she nor I initially realised the full value of the bowl, I immediately recognised that it was a fine piece, and the owner had always admired it herself and had it displayed on a chest of drawers in her living room.\u0027Once it was consigned to us for sale, I was then able to fully research the bowl and confirm that it was a genuine \u0026amp particularly fine and rare example of Imperial Chinese porcelain.\u0027As the sale day approached and interest grew amongst dealers \u0026amp collectors, we were fairly certain that we could expect a figure in the region of £80,000-100,000.          With flared rim \u0026amp evenly covered glaze of a pale-blueish tone, on raised foot with brown dressing, Yongzheng six-character seal mark in underglaze blue to base, and of the period (1722-1735)\u0027I have been able to trace only 4 examples of this particular type of bowl that have come on the auction market in the past 15 years, and the most recent example sold at a major Hong Kong auction for £110,000, so both we and the owner were surprised and delighted to achieve double that price.\u0027It finally sold to a Chinese buyer after stiff competition from one of London\u0027s top dealers in Chinese porcelain.\u0027  Mr Street said the lot is particularly valuable as the Chinese Emperor Yongzheng\u0027s reign was short, only 13 years, meaning not many items are dated from that period. Posting on Facebook Aldridges wrote:  \u0027Sold For £220,000.

We’ve gone way too far over to appease London-based Remainers and it’ll cost us in the North at a General Election.’The threat of Mr Johnson calling a snap autumn Election is also forcing Labour’s high command to consider fast-tracking so-called ‘deselection ballots’ of backbench MPs critical of Mr Corbyn – despite fears the rows would overshadow the party’s annual conference in Brighton next month.         They said Mr Johnson’s surge in the opinion polls, revealed by The Mail on Sunday last week, was panicking the Labour leader into rethinking his shift against BrexitThe process had been scheduled for October but Mr Corbyn’s advisers fear a sudden Election would leave the 70-year-old party leader no choice but to let backbenchers hostile to him – including Hove’s Peter Kyle – stand for re-election unchallenged by local pro-Corbyn activists.In a further sign of Labour disarray, Mr Corbyn’s inner circle is now said to split over who to anoint as his successor – previous favourite Rebecca Long-Bailey or Left-wing ‘rising star’ Laura Pidcock, who famously said she would never be friends with a Tory.Sources said Shadow Business Secretary Ms Long-Bailey would still be given a starring role at the Labour conference but claimed the leader’s advisers feared she was too closely allied to powerful Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell to ensure Mr Corbyn’s legacy.Last month, Mr Corbyn bowed to mounting pressure from pro-EU colleagues and confirmed that Labour would push for any Tory Brexit deal to be put to a second referendum, promising the party would campaign for Remain. The move came despite dire warnings that it would cost the party seats in Labour-held Northern constituencies such as Wigan and Doncaster, which voted heavily to leave.And those fears have only deepened since an exclusive Mail on Sunday poll last weekend that showed a ten-point poll surge for the Tories under Mr Johnson who has vowed to achieve Brexit ‘no ifs, not buts’ by October 31. The survey put the Tories five points ahead of Labour.But it also revealed that with any leader other than Mr Corbyn, Labour would have a poll lead. Labour is worried that despite the Tories losing the Brecon by-election to the openly anti-Brexit Lib Dems last week, Mr Johnson’s party pushed Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party into a distant third place, with Labour a dismal fourth.         A YouGov poll for the Times found the Tories had gained seven percentage points in support over the past week - and were 10 points ahead of Labour  Party insiders say the developments have shaken Mr Corbyn and chief aide Seumas Milne into thinking they should revert to the much-criticised, old policy of ‘constructive ambiguity’ to appeal to both Brexit-backing Labour voters in the North and Remain supporters in London and the South East.One said: ‘They think they’ve just gone too far to appease the Southern-based Remainers in the party while we can’t compete with the Lib Dems as an avowedly anti-Brexit party. Corbyn can’t exactly reverse the pledge to back a second referendum if we’re still in opposition but he could send a much more Brexit-friendly message of how Labour in government would honour the 2016 referendum result by making sure we left.’But Labour moderates such as Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer and Ms Thornberry – both North London MPs – will be outraged by any move away from a pro-Remain stance. Only last week, Ms Thornberry said her party would be ‘off our bloody rockers’ not to back remaining in the EU.She said Labour should campaign for that result in a referendum on Brexit with or without a deal.Labour denied last night there was any panic over Mr Johnson’s early impact, pointing to an opinion poll yesterday that put Labour in the lead. Sources also denied there was any rethink under way on the party’s Brexit policy. "},{"url":null,"title":"Stansted second worst airport world delays","story":"Share this article Last month, the record high temperatures caused chaos at Stansted, with a string of delays and cancellations.

The pound fell again last week, the Bank of England warned about the threat of recession, and manufacturing activity contracted for the third month running.Rolls-Royce, which reports first-half results on Tuesday, is bound to face questions about how it will fare if Britain dumps itself out of the EU on 31 October. With operations in nine EU countries, the aerospace company’s business is highly integrated with the single market. It makes engines for Airbus’s planes, produced in Toulouse, and has a factory in Dahlewitz, near Berlin, that employs about 10,000 people.Rolls-Royce has some advantages over other manufacturers under a no-deal Brexit. First, the aerospace industry already operates under World Trade Organisation rules, so there will be no extra tariffs. Second, it works at a steadier pace than the car industry and doesn’t rely on just-in-time deliveries of parts hurtling back and forth across the Channel.But Rolls-Royce has warned that Brexit could upset its supply chain and constrain it from hiring the best-qualified people. It has spent up to £100m stockpiling parts at its main Derby plant and at Dahlewitz to minimise disruption. It has also discussed using Airbus’s giant Beluga transporter planes to deliver engines made in Derby to France and Germany.Those plans, however thorough, still rely on the companies in Rolls-Royce’s supply chain getting their parts delivered smoothly.Rolls-Royce’s boss, Warren East, supported staying in the EU at the 2016 referendum and urged MPs to vote for Theresa May’s agreement before the now-abandoned March deadline. More recently, East has been less vocal, describing Brexit as a hassle that had to be dealt with. “I’m not sure we’re going to spend as much preparing for some deadline that might never happen,” he said in June. “It’s just an unnecessary distraction for businesses.”Like many people, East may simply be fed up with discussing Brexit. Then again, with the government filled with Brexit hardliners, he may see no point in making himself unpopular with the new regime.East, who has run Rolls-Royce for four years, has got plenty of other things to keep him busy as he seeks to restore the company’s place as the standard bearer for UK engineering. A series of profit warnings and a Serious Fraud Office investigation, now resolved, had damaged Rolls-Royce’s reputation.East found a lumbering bureaucracy unable to respond quickly enough to changes in the industry. He chopped 600 senior manager posts and is in the middle of cutting another 4,600 jobs from the company’s workforce of about 50,000.Rolls-Royce has had to set aside £1.5bn to fix faults with its Trent 1000 engines, whose turbine blades were wearing out too quickly, grounding customers’ planes. East has said Trent 1000 orders are on the increase after a grim patch last year.David Perry, an analyst at JP Morgan Cazenove, argues there are problems ahead because the company has underestimated the cost of developing electric engines in response to pressure on the industry over emissions.Last year, Rolls-Royce swung to an £803m loss, excluding financing costs, from a £1.2bn profit the year before, as it spent £790m fixing the Trent 1000’s faults. For the first half of 2019 analysts expect the underlying pre-tax profit, which excludes Trent 1000 costs and other one-offs, to rise to £95m from £81m."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0de359454f64e874cb67ec0e3e912a57b1e35e9b/0_230_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ee16e830f3e99685c2fe85e9a3abd7a","title":"celebrate scotland local heroes not unloved royals","story":"The Queen doesn’t need another building named after her, but there are many Scots who do deserve the honourEdinburgh’s ornamental grandeur comes at a price: this is a city that seems eternally sedated by servitude and exults in deference. Perhaps this is why Britain’s gingerbread royal family likes to use it as its main Scottish pied-à-terre. Very few public edifices are permitted to be built in Edinburgh unless they are dedicated to the Queen.In fairness, this civic obsequiousness is not confined to Scotland’s capital. No adequate explanation has been forthcoming about why Glasgow’s grand new infirmary was named the Queen Elizabeth University hospital. It seems to have been decreed that almost every major medical facility and institution in Scotland must be named after the Queen and her lineage. Billy Connolly was entertained by the thought that a shadowy troupe of saboteurs roamed Glasgow at night throwing diced carrots into pools of vomit. Within Scotland’s municipal sanhedrin, there seems to be a secret sect dedicated to throwing royal names at each new, important building when no one is looking.The latest manifestation of this curious pastime came last month when it was revealed that the newly completed flagship UK government base in Edinburgh will be named Queen Elizabeth House. The building, next to Waverley station, is just round the corner from the Royal Mile. It will sit alongside Princes Street, named by King George III after his two sons, Prince George and Prince Frederick. Glaswegians, who seem compelled to puncture the pomposity of anything remotely stately or important, quickly renamed their new hospital “the Sweaty Betty”. Perhaps the new UK hub that will become the home of an army of government drones could become Les Lizerables.It’s also appropriate that one of David Mundell’s last acts as secretary of state for Scotland was to issue an oleaginous eulogium for this place. “I am absolutely delighted that her majesty has agreed to the naming of the new UK government hub in Edinburgh. The royal title is hugely fitting, given the hub will be the focus of the UK government’s work in Scotland. The building will contain a dedicated cabinet room, the first of its kind outside of London, and I very much look forward to inviting the cabinet to meet in the building once it is open for business.”The importance of the Scotland office has been reduced in recent years to something barely above a passport agency. This has been reflected in the quality of government placemen who have been told to staff it. However, Mundell contrived to leave it less important than when he’d found it. He made it a footstool of Downing Street rather than an outpost of Scotland. Boris Johnson has rendered it a toy department by giving it to a comedy toff, an amusing way of humiliating Ruth Davidson for her disloyalty. What else did she and Mundell expect? When you spend years in a state of supplication to your bosses you don’t earn their respect, only their contempt.Last week, Nicola Sturgeon visited the Vennel, opposite Edinburgh Castle, to pay tribute to Bessie Watson, who became the youngest ever suffragette, aged nine. She unveiled a plaque in honour of Bessie, who played the bagpipes across Britain, campaigning for women’s right to vote. Watson was, said Sturgeon, “a very impressive and a very, very inspirational young woman”. The first minister’s tenure has been characterised by an enthusiasm for honouring little-known local heroes or attending events unannounced, where she is happy to risk her dignity singing folk songs with pick-up bands or dressing up in Viking warrior gear, as she did at two recent events.Sturgeon and her aides are sometimes chided for over-thinking their approach to politics and civic engagement, but she gets it right more often than not. Those who encounter her in these moments simply appreciate them for what they are: a warm acknowledgment of their work and lives from the country’s leader, a woman who received no favours or privileges on her own rise to the top.The names of many of Scotland’s most recognisable landmarks that bear an incongruous royal imprint are probably too old and fondly regarded to be changed now. Not so some recent places and buildings. The Queen Elizabeth University hospital is barely four years old and its name hasn’t settled into the folds of the public consciousness. You would hope that, if Scotland gains its independence, the hospitals and infirmaries bizarrely named for impervious royalty will be renamed in favour of those physicians who were born or worked in Scotland and helped advance medical science and care, such as Joseph Lister, Alexander Fleming and Elsie Inglis.After a decent stretch, post-independence Scotland will surely begin to dismantle most manifestations of foolish royal fealty. A grown-up country should be sparing with its garlands and civic beatifications. Only the names of those who have earned our admiration by displaying heroic attributes in the service of others in peacetime and at war should adorn our cherished buildings and spaces.As for Edinburgh’s brand-new government centre, I’d propose Irvine Welsh, Margo MacDonald or Eddie Turnbull. Perhaps, too, in the naming of any new Edinburgh hospital it could be time to overlook the unorthodox methods of William Burke and William Hare. Instead, we should accentuate the positive and recognise their sterling contributions in the cause of medical research: every saint has a past, every sinner has a future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4f657ac13944f1d7a2e728035a260144f0d00fd/0_87_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26f5c99a9526408661a7d383148b318b","title":"children are great but they can leave you skint","story":"There is a point in parenting where you ask yourself whether it’s all worth it. In crude financial terms, the answer is probably no. The most well-paid of women aside, it’s routine for couples to find that a mother’s return to work costs almost as much in nursery fees as her wages are worth (and sometimes more). Childcare becomes a patchwork thing: as many sessions in the creche as you can stretch to, hasty parental handovers between shifts, a willing grandparent to pick up the slack if you’re lucky. Always, the low hum of panic that this is the day it all falls to pieces.When this was my choice to make, my partner and I stretched and strained to make it work, because hanging on until school started would have put a five-year hole in a career that I hadn’t even begun. But there was another option – or there would have been, if I’d weighed this all up pre-pregnancy. Like many of my friends, I could have just not. No babies. No payslip turning to dust in your hand. No begging your childminder for lates when your office needs you just a bit longer. No joy of parenting either, but how can you miss people who haven’t been born?My child-free friends are not exceptions. New figures from the Office for National Statistics say that the birth rate in England and Wales is the lowest since records began: just 1.7 children per woman, some way below the replacement level of 2.1. Nor are England and Wales outliers: many developed nations are in the same situation. One cause is the rise in women’s status. Universally, the more education women have, the fewer babies they want. Another pressure is urbanisation. On a farm, a new child will soon be another pair of hands to work. In the city, they’re just another mouth to feed.More nations will follow suit. According to Darrell Bricker and John Ibbitson in their book Empty Planet, global population will peak around the middle of this century and then begin to decline. It’s not necessarily a condition to be mourned – after all, fewer people will mean less consumption of natural resources, lower CO2 emissions, reduced competition for land. But the population will be disproportionately old. They will age out of work. The economy will shrink. They will need care, and there will be fewer people to provide it. It’s an unprecedented challenge for governments, yet the rhetoric of “we’re full” marches on and electorates turn cold on immigration, the only thing to have reliably kept the working-age population in proportion.The alternative, beloved of strongman populists, is natalism: the ugly effort to compel women into motherhood. In Poland, this has meant restricting abortion rights. In Hungary, women with four or more children are exempted from income tax. In China, state propaganda stigmatises women without children as “leftover”, just as it once condemned those who breached the old one-child policy. The implication is the same: the female body is a resource that the state can appropriate to ensure its own growth.However, in Germany, the emphasis is on supporting women rather than exploiting them. There is generous leave, designed to encourage men to take their share so the whole parenting burden won’t devolve on to women, while every child aged over one is entitled to a nursery place (although provision is still short). And, thanks to a few other factors, it seems to work: the Economist recently reported that Germany’s birth rate rose from 1.33 to 1.57 between 2006 and 2017.While the cost of keeping the population going is borne by women, they will opt out of that bad bargain. If our government wants to soften the coming demographic blow, its only option is to play the part of the supportive grandparent and step up on the childcare front.• Sarah Ditum is a writer on politics and culture"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2467fcc4a369e6a8edeb9047c603a0b6e9dfe48e/0_21_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=362b250e1c21efe31038eb7e3ca9f28c","title":"facebook ads new polticial norm voters in dark where they come from","story":"If there is an autumn election, voters will be bombarded by a wave of unregulated ‘news’On the day Boris Johnson took over as prime minister, hundreds of Facebook ads dropped like confetti into thousands of UK voters’ news feeds. Many were virtually identical, featuring a black-and-white photograph of Johnson gazing towards an unseen audience. “These are my priorities,” one version of the ad read. “What are yours?”Quickly, the ads were interpreted as the start of Johnson’s election campaign and the splurge drew immediate parallels with the Facebook-driven 2016 Vote Leave campaign, especially since the director of that campaign – the Svengali-like Dominic Cummings – walked into 10 Downing Street as Johnson’s most senior adviser on the same day. Then on Friday we learned, through reports in the , that the political campaigning firm CTF Partners, one of whose heads ran Johnson’s leadership campaign, was running a network of unbranded “news” pages on Facebook on behalf of its clients.The Facebook ad blitz rightly attracted media attention, but was it inherently sinister? In this particular case, there is good reason to be suspicious. Data and digital advertising were critical to the success of Vote Leave – as Cummings has told us in his voluminous blogs – yet we still know very little about what data was collected, how it was used and the role played by the uncommunicative Canadian company, AggregateIQ.Cummings himself has refused to appear before the Commons select committee for digital, culture, media and sport to explain what he did (and has been found in contempt of parliament as a consequence). The Vote Leave campaign has been found to have broken electoral law. And this is separate to the lingering questions about Cambridge Analytica and the referendum, rekindled by Netflix’s new film, The Great Hack. There is therefore good reason to distrust Cummings’s campaigning methods.Yet to condemn all online political campaigns ignores the extent to which digital advertising has become ubiquitous since 2016. The Conservatives may be spending lots right now, but every major party is ploughing money into Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Google and YouTube. According to the Facebook ad archive, Labour has spent £175,000 since last October, the Liberal Democrats £288,000 and the Brexit party £190,000. And this is just on Facebook and does not include what they spend on other digital platforms, email campaigns or on data collection and analysis.Nor is it just the political parties – non-party campaigners, NGOs and iniduals are all using digital platforms to push their messages, as are People’s Vote, Best for Britain, Britain’s Future and the London mayor. Similarly, Friends of the Earth, Liberty, the RSPCA, Greenpeace, 38 Degrees and other charities are using social media to raise awareness of issues such as the climate crisis, human rights and dog care. There is even a site called ScramNews using Facebook ads to raise money to pay for anti-Brexit-party ads – on Facebook.If you want to push a message, why not use the cheapest, most effective way to mobilise your target audience? Using television news would, by comparison, seem bizarre and anachronistic. Britons aged 16 to 24 have deserted traditional news outlets, we discovered recently from Ofcom research. They now watch, on average, only two minutes of TV news a day, as compared with the over-65s who are still watching over half an hour. Most young people get their news online, chiefly via social media. Any campaigner who does not try to reach young people via their phones is unlikely to last very long in campaigning.But until recently we could not see what candidates and parties were promising on Facebook. We did not know if the promises they made were true, false, distorted, contradictory, defensible or unethical. Now each of the major platforms keeps archives of political ads so we can look at who is targeting what at whom. There is still a lot to be done to improve the archives, as seen by a recently published Mozilla report, but we are far better off than in 2016.Given the ubiquity of online political advertising and its growing transparency, there is a temptation to think we should stop worrying and accept it as a fact of digital life. This would be a mistake. Why? Because there are still huge gaps between the laws and regulations that protect elections and referendums in the real world and those that apply online. And, as the  investigation into CTF Partners shows, digital propaganda keeps evolving.Take transparency. Online, there are still untold opportunities to run dark campaigns with funding from who knows where. We still do not know the source, for example, of the £435,154 that a company called Britain’s Future has spent on pro-Brexit Facebook ads since last October. We are only now discovering that this was one of a number of political “Astroturf” campaigns managed covertly by Lynton Crosby’s CTF partners, campaigns that deliberately blurred political advertising with unbranded “news”. Should there be an autumn election, you can be sure there will be many pop-up campaigns, with tailored “news” promoted through hundreds of online ads, whose sources of funding will be unknown.At any future election, the political parties will use Facebook’s tools to target adverts at carefully selected susceptible voters in marginal constituencies. They will, just as Cummings has told us Vote Leave did in 2016, bombard these voters with pre-tested messages and we will not know how they select these voters or how they adapt their messaging based on the responses.And though they will spend significant amounts on a small number of voters in a select group of constituencies, it is highly unlikely any of this money will be allocated to the constituency itself. This will not even be against the law.Political advertising online may now be integral to any modern campaign, and it is becoming more open and familiar, but there is still much that must change before we can stop worrying. Yet, with Cummings and the Vote Leave team installed in No 10, and an autumn election likely, chances of electoral reform are slim to nonexistent.• Martin Moore is the author of Democracy Hacked: How Technology is Destabilizing Global Politics and a senior lecturer at King’s College London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea69c942d51ae6eff06d80c42ed35418e48d8958/0_600_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bcfafd48c00303e71485794220c39c4","title":"meghan markle seems to mix with wrong people unlike other royals","story":"Surely the outrage over the duchess’s Vogue cover had nothing to do with race, did it?Since it’s a good few weeks since Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, has worn jeans to Wimbledon, carried her baby the wrong way or used a shawl made by impoverished workers, her mentors have been on the alert for further evidence that their continual inspection of this member of the royal family is not racist bullying but a series of pedagogic opportunities. They wish only to help her improve.But her worst enemies, with which the UK press is strangely well supplied, could not have anticipated that Meghan’s next gift to them would be something so lavish, so rich in opportunities for point-by-point demolition, as an entire edition of Vogue, guest-edited while she was on maternity leave. That’s around the same time, Piers Morgan has pointed out, as she was not meeting his racist and sexist friend Donald Trump. A learning moment, then: see how the other royals dressed up for Trump and what a boon that has proved for Anglo-US relations?Even her supporters may wonder if there is something marginally more inspirational a famous gifted person might choose to do than help shift copies of Condé Nast’s September money-spinner, notwithstanding Vogue’s tradition of cover princesses. If it’s quite refreshing to discover a Q\u0026ampA with Michelle Obama, a charity project and – least royal of all – a poem, this is still Vogue and in the business of urging women to (a) subscribe to its culture of eating-disordered ageism and (b) buy more useless shit.If anything, a socially responsible, duchess-edited September issue fulfils, as never before, Vogue’s editorial challenge: to temper conspicuous consumption with occasional glints of awareness without frightening the advertisers.Right now, for instance, as well as being super-excited about featuring the non-models Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Greta Thunberg and Jacinda Ardern among Markle’s “Forces For Change” cover women, the magazine is thrilled to report, in forces for obsolescence news, that Victoria Beckham, one of its favourite heads on a stick, has been posing, all sciency, in a lab coat: a chance for it to help generate, with some verbatim marketing copy, interest in her new range of women-focused detritus: “VB Beauty as a digital-native brand”.If she can’t eradicate these blots on her vision, Meghan does address them in an obligatory “you may say I’m a dreamer” section of her introduction: “There will be advertising sections that are requisite for every issue, so while I feel confident that you’ll feel my thumbprint on most pages, please know that there are elements that just come with the territory.” Moreover, she might have added, her father-in-law has twice guest-edited Country Life, regardless of the incompatibility between its property porn and princely jeremiads about unfettered materialism.But the collision of Meghan’s “great fear of shallow living” with Vogue’s incitement to insatiable acquisition (“anklets are back to make bare legs the centre of attention”!) is not, it emerges, what troubles prominent critics. Rather, the UK’s finest Meghan-assassins have alighted on her most striking advance on the Vogue norm: the cover women. They are variously too BAME, too famous, not famous enough, too political, too unpolitical and not, it’s generally agreed, the Queen.Morgan, the UK’s Meghanfinder general, complains that only five of the women were British and none was male. “So it’s not actually inclusive at all.” Jameela Jamil particularly distresses this loyal Trumpian, on account of her incivility. Elsewhere, Sarah Vine draws on personal experience of state-funded decor and the careful choice of friends to counsel “dear Meghan”, as she calls this outsider, on “proper royalty”. “Ask the Queen.”It’s not a bad idea. The Queen’s success in protecting her reputation from less impressive friendships, such as with the troubled ruler of Dubai, does contrast favourably with the damage to Meghan’s of fashionable allies whose names have never, unlike the sheikh’s, featured in UK courts in connection with feared abduction and forced marriage.Meghan might further benefit, at this wobbly stage on her learning curve, from instruction by another fully inducted royal, Prince Andrew, formerly a close friend and house-guest of Jeffrey Epstein, the US sex offender currently jailed and accused of trafficking and sexually assaulting young girls. In 2015, one alleged that she had been coerced into sex with Andrew, an allegation he denied. While massed commenters expose the threat to the royal reputation posed by Meghan’s lamentable female associates, Andrew’s name has featured only occasionally in connection with the latest revelations about Epstein, which include the latter’s plans to populate the world with his own gene pool and have his head and penis frozen for perpetuity.Proper royalness, in such situations, possibly explains why HRH, as an unapologetic pervert’s companion, is still deputising for his mother, if not the Foreign Office, and largely untroubled by the same press moralists who argue that Meghan doesn’t understand the traditional role of the monarchy. On the other hand, given the comparative expressions of disquiet, perhaps Meghan’s recent offences really do exceed Fergie’s, in 2011, when she welcomed a £15,000 loan (organised by Prince Andrew’s office) from the recently released Epstein. Was it ever repaid?Next, as part of the supplementary training now widely proposed for our clumsy royal apprentice, she could study how Prince Charles’s reputation survived devoted friendships with – to date – three paedophiles: Laurens van der Post, Jimmy Savile and an already cautioned offender, Peter Ball. Meghan’s Instagram account alone has generated more hostile press than the recent conclusion of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse that the prince’s support for Ball was “misguided”.How have the above royals avoided relentless Meghan-style bollockings on account of, variously, execrable judgment, bad taste, susceptibility to wealth andor flattery? There must, surely, be something more to it than having white skin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38ec2874c236c46b658b2949b920365967c4c3fc/0_125_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b607579b59c8c0f65746f7cde7e2c7d9","title":"no longer does al qaida grab headlines that might be plan","story":"Do you remember al-Qaida? Not the al-Qaida of today that no one pays any attention to, but the one of a decade or so ago, with its sinister mastermind leader hidden in the deep cave complexes of the Hindu Kush the “sleeper cells” all over North America or, more realistically, its ideology that inspired young men in the UK to travel to Pakistan to be trained in the terrorist techniques used to kill more than 50 people on tube trains and a bus in London.Probably not. If you’ve given much thought to the organisation in the past year or so, you’re a member of a fairly select group.This raises a profound question: how is it that a group that commanded such extraordinary, unprecedented attention across the world from 2001 to 2011 can disappear from public attention so completely?Once, stories about new threats posed by al-Qaida – biological weapons smeared on door knobs (false), explosives concealed as liquids and smuggled on to planes (true) filled our newspapers. Rappers parodied its propaganda videos. Osama bin Laden’s every utterance was parsed and picked over. He was described, wrongly, as a Muslim Che Guevara. His face was on the leather jackets of Thai bikers and T-shirts in Kenya, while his name was given to a rogue elephant in northeastern India.The  and Observer, whose pages were once replete with reports on the organisation, mentioned al-Qaida just 11 times in the past year and two of those references were prompted by the death of the son of Osama, Hamza bin Laden, which was reported by US officials last week. And when al-Qaida did appear in speech notes of the US president, it was misspelt.One obvious reason for this precipitous decline in the attention given to the group has been the appalling successes of Islamic State in recent years, particularly its far superior use of modern media techniques and technology. Its rivals’ bloody videos have overshadowed al-Qaida’s pedestrian efforts at communication, which still often comprise tedious lectures by its wooden, uncharismatic, 68-year-old leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri.Could the digital revolution be to “blame”? Though conventional wisdom is that new media provide opportunities to insurgents and extremists, al-Qaida’s ability to command global headlines peaked well before digital technologies were widespread. Its decline occurred as they have spread. Perhaps, like “legacy” news organisations, the group has simply struggled to adapt to the new media environment.But this seems inadequate as an explanation for al-Qaida’s almost total eclipse. There are others that are simpler. One is that Bin Laden, a perfect front man with his backstory of relinquished riches and quiet authority, was killed. But it is interesting that, contrary to the expectations of many, his death at the hands of US special forces at his hideout in northern Pakistan in 2011 did not create a cult following, although his name is still venerated in jihadist circles.The real reason for its lower profile is that al-Qaida has dramatically changed its strategy in recent years. It now eschews spectacular attacks on western target, or targets in the west, in favour of a slow, careful expansion in the Sahel, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Afghanistan and elsewhere. There have been many setbacks, but this approach brings some idends – a solid presence in important parts of the Islamic world, loyal participants in high-profile conflicts, a distance from Isis’s egregious brutality and a significant decline in attention paid to it by western policymakers.This leads to an important conclusion. Al-Qaida’s eclipse is not just the natural passing of a once-dangerous group. Nathan Sales, the US state department’s counter-terrorism co-ordinator, told reporters that “what we see today is an al-Qaida that is as strong as it has ever been”. It is a deliberate choice, which implies that acquiring the high profile the group once enjoyed was a conscious decision too. After all, very often what you turn off, you can turn back on.This says a lot about the nature of terrorism and the reaction it produces. Bin Laden became notorious by design, not accident. He used violence to radicalise supporters, mobilise backing and terrorise enemies. He built his brand, in the days before digital media, by ensuring that what he did received vast publicity.Not only did he understand that those targeted by terrorism extrapolate from a single act to imagine a general threat – one bus has been attacked, so all are now seen as dangerous one office block in one city has been destroyed, so all such buildings are now at risk – but that sympathisers did so too.For everyone, including many policymakers, a small number of spectacular and very violent gestures suggested a power and potential to harm that was very much greater than the group ever really possessed. Even the 911 attacks in 2001 involved just 19 hijackers, plus a relatively light support network and a training camp or two. Most of its operations involved fewer people and resources. The cave complexes and those secret weapons did not actually exist.This is not to say the group never posed a threat – it did, as the appalling carnage that resulted from its attacks attests – but that for much of its existence there was very much less to al-Qaida than met the eye. One aim of the violence was to prompt a massive and in many ways counterproductive response from the west. In this, too al-Qaida was successful.No one knows which direction the late and unlamented Hamza bin Laden might have taken al-Qaida had he assumed leadership. A United Nations security council report last week disclosed that al-Zawahiri is in poor health with “questions over his longevity”.If a new head of al-Qaida decides to ramp up the global profile of the group with a few attacks on western interests, would we respond any differently than we did between 2001 and 2011? I doubt it.• Jason Burke is the Africa correspondent of the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b1682c69cc06d7b99e0a55a51627b819849c618/0_79_5313_3187/master/5313.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fae6bee2944f2c1ab199c434f5fde9c6","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of shimmer","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘shimmer’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘shimmer’.Share your photos of what shimmer means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 7 August at 10am.

We can thank Canadian institution Tim Hortons for the doughnut obsession. The shop, founded by the NHL defenseman of the same name, opened in 1964 and became a million-dollar-a-year franchise, outselling most (if not all) fast-food chains. If you’re feeling nostalgic, visit the original in Hamilton, Ontario or take a trip to independent doughnut chain, Donut Monster, also in the city, where yeast-risen rounds are topped with seasonal flavours. Our favourite to date has to be the brownie cheesecake! But if you’re not in Ontario, check out Lucky’s Doughnuts at the 49th Parallel Café in BC or family-owned business, Bronuts in Winnipeg. They use natural ingredients and have been known to offer unique flavours such as roasted garlic and asiago cheese or rosemary and lavender.

You’ll have to move to, or at least visit, the Northwest Territories to make it happenIn Canada’s Northwest Territories, polar bears abound – in the form of number plates. In 1970, to celebrate the centennial of Northwest Territories, the government introduced a number plate shaped like a polar bear. Sure, some may have thought it was unusual at first. But since then, many have become delighted and wanted one for themselves. Pro tip: we’ve seen some vintage plates sold on eBay.If you want to branch out into road signs, then there are more than 77,000 to be seen at Watson Lake Signpost Forest.

Well then, listen up because we have a tale for you. Legend has it that Ogopogo inhabits Lake Okanagan in the BC interior. This creature has been described as a “giant snake” about 50 feet long, lurking in the dark expanse of the lake. While there have been sightings dating as far back as the 19th century, the most recent was in September 2018. From the lake, drive to the Okanagan Spirits Craft Distillery to learn a bit more about western Canada’s oldest craft distillery, and take a whisky tour.

Located on a 32-hectare (80-acre) farm, it’s a hidden treasure and one of the best ways to support local artists. If you want to see if you can sneak a peek of Ogopogo, why not try scuba ing at Fintry provincial park? It also houses a sunken Canadian Pacific Railway barge, should you not get lucky with the monster.Did you know that Santa Claus had a legitimate postal address?

Thanks to Sea North Tours, you’ll be able to have the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to hear belugas singing through hydrophones – you can listen to their whistles and squeals while observing their majestic beauty from boats that have no moving parts that can harm the whales.The province where Anne of Green Gables was set, Prince Edward Island is just 140 miles long and 35 miles wideFun fact: as one of Canada’s three Maritime provinces, Prince Edward Island is the smallest. Not only can it lay claim to being the smallest in land area, but also in population of the three. The province, however, takes it in its stride, with the motto being “Parva sub ingenti” (The small under the protection of the great). There are few places more unusual than Basin Head provincial park, which is perhaps better known as Singing Sands, because the pure white sands do just that. Due to the high silica content, when heated by the sun, the sand produces a high-pitched squeaking sound when walked across – and endless fun.For a period of time, Canada suffered a shortage of coins. So, while they worked to produce more, playing cards were used as currencyIn the late 1600s, coins arriving from France were in short supply. This meant that as Canada worked hard to get more currency in, playing cards took the place of coins to keep the economy going. The Royal Canadian Mint made a nod to this in 2018 by releasing a special-edition coin set fashioned in the likeness of 17th-century playing cards.Fly WestJet to discover (and enjoy!) the weird and the wonderful things in Canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d5cd19eb528d613ba4f9b4981e3efd2ccbe8ff1/59_93_3718_2231/master/3718.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21e88bc9ae568f7423e7b7444514b137","title":"whaley bridge residents allowed to return for 15 minutes","story":"Emergency workers continue efforts to prevent dam collapse as further heavy rain expectedThunderstorms are threatening to bring more unwanted rainfall to a Derbyshire town where a damaged dam is feared to be at risk of collapse.Dozens more homes have been evacuated in Whaley Bridge before bad weather expected from Sunday afternoon, as emergency workers continued their efforts to prevent the dam giving way.

Officers have stopped people entering the steep-sided village since Thursday afternoon when a month-and-a-half’s rain fell on the Derbyshire hills in just 48 hours, causing massive damage to the 180-year-old dam at Toddbrook reservoir.Engineers deemed there was a “substantial risk to life” should the reservoir fail, prompting the evacuation of the lower quarter of the town.Ania Hill had been worrying about her cat, Slippers, ever since the evacuation. She was relieved to find him alive but distressed. He had not gone hungry after a neighbour managed to throw him food through the letterbox. “He was quite upset, I’ve had to put him in the dark in the boot to calm him down,” she said, after her personal rescue mission.Police had stipulated that only one person per household would be allowed through the cordon. Visits were to be timed, with residents signing in and out. But in practice, many people had brought a friend or spouse and took longer than their allotted 15 minutes, as an RAF Chinook helicopter ferried bags of aggregate to drop on the damaged dam.Gill and Martin Shaw, who live on Buxton Road, the main road through the town, took the opportunity to return home and move more belongings – furniture and Gill’s collection of ornaments – upstairs.Like many residents, they take seriously the warning from engineers who said on Friday night that they remained very concerned about the integrity of the structure, despite an extensive pumping operation having reduced water levels in Toddbrook reservoir. They were also worried about looters after Martin returned on Friday night to see two men trying to break into his shed. “It was two fellas, their trousers all wet – I think they must have entered the village via the River Goyt, which runs right behind our house,” said Martin.Derbyshire police said it would look into the claims of looting, with a press officer saying she was unaware of problems of that nature following the mass evacuation.Fred Salmon, who runs the Bike Factory shop in the centre of the town, arrived with his van, hoping to bundle as many bicycles in the back as he could. Another woman, rushing too much to give her name, speed-walked to her house to pick up her passport: she was off on holiday later in the day.Dan Curley, the landlord of the Cock pub on Buxton Road, was finally allowed back to fetch his spectacles, having spent the first 36 hours after the evacuation with a splitting headache.Peter Drinkwater was among those allowed to return to his terraced cottage. “Until the evacuation, I’d never spent a night away from the house in 37 years,” he said after retrieving a selection of clothes and medication.His daughter, Cathryn Swann, said: “It feels really eerie down there. The police had told us to come straight back if we heard any rumbling sounds, and of course there was rumbling anyway from all the aggregate being dropped on to the dam.“I panicked a couple of times, but thankfully we’re OK.”Ruth George, the local Labour MP, who lives just outside Whaley Bridge, arrived to find out the latest news.She said she had written to Boris Johnson on Friday night after his visit. He told residents that he had flown over the dam and thought it was “dodgy but stable” and assured them they would all be rehoused should the worst happen.In her letter to the prime minister, George asked him to ensure a proper investigation into why the reservoir dam had been damaged and to ensure it can’t happen again. “It’s not just about the emergency situation, as important as that is,” she wrote. “Whaley Bridge as a town needs to be able to feel safe for the long term and we need to know what the options are.”She commended the emergency services but warned that the situation remained critical, with poor weather expected from Sunday. “We’re expecting lots and lots of rain over the next few days so I can quite understand the authorities not being prepared to say it’s safe until those storms have gone.”Edwina Currie, a former Conservative MP who lives in one of the higher parts of the town, said: “Our reservoir is looking like it’s in intensive care at the moment. There are pipes everywhere giving it the treatment it needs. But we are a sturdy lot up here and you won’t hear us complaining.”The environment minister Thérèse Coffey said the situation remained in a “critical stage” on Saturday as she issued a message to residents.“I cannot emphasise enough how patient they need to be,” Coffey told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “Of course this is a distressing and worrying time for them, but if that dam were to breach it would lead to a loss of life if there were people there. There’s no doubt about that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12fad6e8a7a72522a78bc4221a17d57df76a88d7/0_142_4270_2562/master/4270.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=473979cb53372fb3752938b56333837b","title":"britains 2800 toddbrook dams why built how safe","story":"Toddbrook Reservoir was built in the 1830s and passed a safety check in NovemberEngland and Wales have about 2,000 dams and there are around 800 in Scotland. These structures were built for a variety of reasons: to make reservoirs that can supply drinking water to nearby towns and cities to fill local canals to help farms and to create places for fishing, sailing and water sports.In the case of Toddbrook’s dam, it was built in the 1830s to create a reservoir that would provide water for the local canal system. It is still owned by the Canal \u0026amp River Trust.All UK reservoirs with a capacity above 25,000 cubic metres must comply with the Reservoirs Act and a civil engineer has to file an annual safety report to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). The Canal \u0026amp River Trust said the annual inspection of Toddbrook Reservoir in November indicated that the dam was “absolutely fine”.A trust spokesperson added that the reservoir is also inspected twice a week and it was during the most recent visit that the problems affecting Toddbrook were revealed.Professor Nigel Wright, a civil engineer and expert in flood risk management, told the BBC yesterday that the last evacuation associated with dam problems in the UK occurred in 2007, when cracks appeared in the dam at Ulley Reservoir, near Rotherham, following heavy rain. A new spillway was later built to replace the original which collapsed during the floods.“Since then, the government has insisted that a lot of dams have been reanalysed to check what the danger is and come up with plans for evacuation if necessary,” added Wright, who is based at Nottingham Trent University."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2e74462aee93d7ac66c919c92377b314d8b6eca/0_5_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=273202d36f8230734f292a70ef322d68","title":"peter webber interview inna de yard reggae","story":"The British director on his love of Jamaican reggae – subject of his documentary Inna de Yard – and why he’s no longer a doom-mongerDirector Peter Webber was born in 1968 and grew up in west London. His 2003 feature Girl With a Pearl Earring, starring Scarlett Johansson and Colin Firth, received three Oscar and 10 Bafta nominations. In 2007, he directed Hannibal Rising, a prequel to Silence of the Lambs. Following music documentaries about Schubert and Wagner earlier in his career, Webber’s new film Inna de Yard focuses on a group of veteran reggae artists – including 70s star Ken Boothe and Cedric Myton from the Congos – revisiting their glory days in the hills above Kingston, Jamaica.What compelled you to make a reggae documentary?This film really went back to passions and enthusiasms I’ve had since I was a teenager. What really hooked me into reggae was listening to the first Clash album and hearing their cover version of Police and Thieves. From there, I went to a record shop in Notting Hill and was guided to the Junior Murvin original. That was the beginning of a love affair with Jamaican music that continues to this day.Inna de Yard is the name of a loose Jamaican reggae collective that tours together. How did you hear about it?From a French producer on my previous film, Pickpockets. He told me about this small group of reggae musicians getting together in a clapboard house outside Kingston. It’s not really a studio: they just stick some microphones up there and everyone comes along with acoustic instruments. I’ve filmed a fair few recording studios over the years and, frankly, they’re terrible, antiseptic spaces, but this is an amazing place with a big deck overlooking a valley. A lot of these guys learned to play in their backyard, so it’s like returning to their roots – there’s something very pure and elemental and joyful about it.This film has been compared to Buena Vista Social Club. Is that useful?Yes, because it must be the most successful music documentary of recent years and I’m a big fan of Wim Wenders. There are some important differences, though: the world at large didn’t know about Cuban music, so there was a great moment of discovery, whereas the world does know about reggae. Also, in Buena Vista Social Club, you’re partly seeing it through Ry Cooder’s eyes. I wanted this story to be told by these musicians in their own voices. I’m just there as a conduit, to help structure and organise. I didn’t want anybody from outside the island talking about it. It’s by these people, for these people.One of the musicians in the film says: “Some countries have diamonds, some have oil, we have reggae music.” But of course it’s no guarantee of wealth…Not at all. They all have cautionary tales about their dealings with record companies, and most of these guys are making money from touring rather than record sales. But somehow they’ve managed to keep going, despite run-ins with the law, being ripped off and suffering death and disaster in their family lives. I really responded to their strength and dignity, because I’d just been through a trauma myself: my younger brother had died suddenly, unexpectedly, during the production. In retrospect, making this film was quite a healing process. It helped me through a dark time in my life.What are your favourite music documentaries?In terms of reggae, Rockers and The Harder They Come are a must for anybody interested in Jamaican culture. And there’s a great film just been reissued called Babylon, about the English reggae scene. Country Man is really interesting too.I notice it says “doom-monger” in your Twitter bio. Explain.That went up because a few years ago I made a film called Ten Billion, which is the world’s most depressing eco-film. But I’m going to try to be a bit more inspirational in future, so I’m removing the doom-monger tag.When you’re not working, how do you amuse yourself?Well, I listen to lots of reggae – and the associated recreational activities. And travel for me is a great balm, especially at the moment when Britain feels like a toxic place to be. I’m looking forward to starting a new project out of Britain, especially if it means I could be away at the end of October.What’s in the pipeline?There’s a few things. One is a sequel to my Netflix film Pickpockets, where the action moves from Colombia to Spain. I’m also working on a post-apocalyptic drama set in the UK, based on the short story Diary of an Interesting Year by Helen Simpson.Inna de Yard is released in cinemas on 30 August. It will premiere at the Film4 Summer Screen at Somerset House on 21 August.

That said, while recent spending has lifted the mood, there’s been scant evidence of any fix to our defensive inadequacies. In the absence of Unai imposing a definitive brand of football, I’m still fearful that the upshot will be the same as it ever was.Key menweak links Despite the Kroenkes relaxing their grip on the purse strings to sign Pépé, we’re still lacking proven talent elsewhere, leaving us praying that the bevy of talented youngsters – Willock, Nelson, Smith Rowe, Medley, Nketiah, Saka, John-Jules, Burton – will fulfil their promise.We need to sign Kieran Tierney would be a result, but it’s the heart of our defence which requires most urgent attention. Mustafi getting the bird from our home crowd before this campaign has even started says it all.Headline maker Sadly it looks like the Mesut Özil saga is set to run and run.VAR: good or bad? To stop it becoming a constant distraction its use has to be strictly limited to resolving just “clear and obvious” errors. Nothing more.Predictions… We will finish: Third. Top four: 1. Liverpool 2. Man City 3. Arsenal 4. Chelsea. Bottom three: 18. Brighton 19. Aston Villa 20. Sheffield United. First manager sacked: Ole Gunnar Solskjær.We chose “Love don’t live here anymore” as the song to accompany Villa’s demise three years ago. Suddenly “Love is all around”. Season ticket sales are through the roof, the homegrown manager and captain have been deified and we’ve splashed the cash. It’s impossible not to be excited. Grealish is a top-six player, nobody will outrun McGinn and Mings is ballast. That said, the Spurs game will be a Premier League bow for eight of our likely XI, so talk of the top 10 is surely too bullish. 14th will do – safe by Easter. We certainly won’t “do a Fulham” – but even if we do, the Championship is bloody marvellous anyway.Key menweak links Grealish won’t get kicked so much in the Premier League. Every Villa fan would love Jota to star given where he came from, but McGinn has hints of Souness (nails), Dalglish (vision, big arse) and Macari (good terrace song) and may really impress.We need to sign Wesley could go either way, so probably some striking cover.Headline maker The tabloids would love it if Terry slipped up but he’s been nothing but a positive since he joined. Wesley is a bit of a non-conformist apparently so that might be fun, and Jack will always be one who enjoys his and our success … and why not? Footballers are too boring these days.VAR: good or bad? It’s a joke. Human error is a (sometimes delicious) part of the game. I also like to get back to the pub within three hours of the kick-off. The pluses of “more right decisions” are far outweighed by the downsides of breaks in play and general “what’s going on?” periods. And how can you go nuts with the spectre of VAR looming over every goal?Predictions… We will finish: 14th. Top four: 1. Man City 2. Liverpool 3. Tottenham 4. Chelsea. Bottom three: 18. Brighton 19. Newcastle 20. Norwich. First manager sacked: Ole Gunnar Solskjær.There’s more apprehension than usual. With the club funding a new training complex, the money for players has been a bit more restricted this summer. Mid-table would be a good season.Key menweak links Wilson, Fraser and Brooks will be the players most talked about – the latter when he’s back from injury. It’ll be Fraser’s last season due to his contract running down. A few youngsters to watch: Lloyd Kelly at left-back and Sam Surridge up front, plus keepers Mark Travers and Aaron Ramsdale, if they aren’t loaned out. As for weaknesses: I’m still not convinced about Solanke, Begovic or Ibe.We need to sign A top keeper, perhaps Jack Butland, and another midfield option – Liverpool’s Harry Wilson would be ideal. But I’m pleased to have signed Philip Billing from Huddersfield – we’ve always lacked height.Headline maker You can pick any of our current back four, or keeper, to make a few talked-about blunders.VAR: good or bad? Bad. Who wants every goal double and triple checked before it’s given? Fans want to celebrate, not wait and hope.Predictions… We will finish: 12th. Top four: 1. Liverpool 2. Man City 3. Tottenham 4. Arsenal. Bottom three: 18. Sheffield United 19. Aston Villa 20. Brighton. First manager sacked: Steve Bruce.It’s a case of fingers crossed. Much lies on the shoulders of Graham Potter after the heart-wrenchingly sad sacking of Chris Hughton. Potter will have to work his magic on what he inherited – who knows if he can do that? A lot of players need to step up (yes, you, Locadia, Jahanbakhsh, Andone) but maybe Potter is the man to lift them. Tony Bloom obviously thinks so, and that’s good enough for me.Key menweak links A lot will be expected of our new £15m winger Leandro Trossard, especially after the (welcome) exit of hotheaded Anthony Knockaert. Elsewhere, young Aaron Connolly could break through, and if Dunk goes, new signing Adam Webster will need to settle in fast. No weak links – although…We need to sign A striker. Or are we going to be relying on Glenn Murray again? He’s 36 in September.Headline maker Hopefully Potter as the ision’s most inspired managerial appointment. Our exciting, attacking play will be a joy to watch and give even Pep Guardiola food for thought, right?VAR: good or bad? It made Manchester City’s Champions League defeat by Spurs enormously entertaining for neutrals. But as the system is still based on an opinion, I don’t think it’s conclusive enough for all the fuss it causes.Predictions… We will finish: 10th. Top four: 1. Liverpool 2. Man City 3. Arsenal 4. Tottenham. Bottom three: 18. Crystal Palace 19. Norwich 20. Aston Villa. First manager sacked: Ole Gunnar Solskjær.I don’t think we’re going to trouble the top six but there are any number of reasons to be optimistic – more so given the second half of last season when not many teams bettered our points return.Key menweak links Hopefully we’ll be defensively organised and so, as always, the attention turns towards the front. We will be needing Barnes, Wood, Rodriguez and Vydra to get those goals. Also watch out for Dwight McNeil, who broke through last season. Central midfielder Josh Benson has looked good in pre-season, too – there are high hopes for him. We’ve got cover for most positions now, and we’ve reached the point where we can just about put out two different teams. As always, it’s the unit that’s the strength at Burnley and I don’t see that changing.We need to sign The centre of midfield could do with strengthening, particularly given Steven Defour’s continuing injury problems. When he’s available he makes so much difference, but we can’t rely on his fitness. We need to add a quality, mobile operator to the squad.Headline maker Barnes is supposed to be the dressing room clown, but, as always, Sean Dyche will dominate our news.VAR: good or bad? Ask me in a year. I have real concerns: I’m not convinced it’ll be beneficial. It’s hard to see how it won’t generate its own controversy.Predictions… We will finish: 12th. Top four: 1. Man City 2. Liverpool 3. Tottenham 4. Arsenal. Bottom three: 18. Brighton 19. Norwich 20. Sheffield United. First manager sacked: Daniel Farke.I’m pretty optimistic – probably more so than I should be given the transfer ban. We have an inexperienced manager – but that manager is Frank Lampard, and that’s what makes me optimistic. A man who understands today’s players, understands the club’s hierarchy and who played under some of the best managers in the world.Key menweak links All eyes on Pulisic, given that he’s meant to be Hazard’s replacement. No pressure then … Players often need at least a season to get used to the speed and physicality of the Premier League, so I’m not going to expect too much this season.We need to sign The damn ban means we’re stuck with the issues we’ve had for a few years: up front, at left- and right-back, and at centre-back, too.Headline maker I can see Jody Morris being to Lampard what Rui Faria was to Mourinho – not that Mourinho couldn’t get into trouble on his own. I think Jody may initiate a Chelsea Fight Club. But, of course, I can’t say anymore, because the first rule of Fight Club is…VAR: good or bad? I can just about put up with technology to confirm whether the ball has crossed the line. Everything else – no – just no. I want to howl at a referee error, scream at the injustice of it all, become apoplectic with rage at a missed red card tackle I want to laugh my ass off when we score an offside goal against Spurs, grin like a lunatic when the wrong Manchester United player gets sent off, and guffaw when the ref overlooks a Liverpool stonewall penalty (as if…). The point is our game is passionate not despite the flaws but because of the flaws. VAR is nonsense.Predictions… We will finish: 3rd. Top four: 1. Man City 2. Tottenham 3. Chelsea 4. Liverpool. Bottom three: 18. Newcastle 19. Brighton 20. Aston Villa. First manager sacked: Steve Bruce.We’ve sold our second-best player, and have, so far, only signed a third-choice keeper. Oh, and made Jordan Ayew’s move from Swansea permanent. Add to that the pressure on wages, the noise surrounding the American part-owners looking to sell their stake, and daily speculation on Zaha, and Palace fans are a little nervous right now.Key menweak links We simply must keep Zaha. The return of Sakho and Tomkins to fitness will be welcome, and Max Meyer has had a strong pre-season. Lack of numbers mean we may have to use youngsters such as Sam Woods and Luke Dreher on the bench.We need to sign Our striking options – yet again – look weak. We still need a quality forward but I doubt we have the funds. And the lack of right- and left-backs is a real concern.Headline maker The ownership of the club will take up some column inches.VAR: good or bad? Palace will undoubtedly win a lot more penalties this season – Luka Milivojevic will surely be top scorer. But the fear is the potential lack of joy after scoring, with the threat of a VAR appeal lurking in the background ready to cancel it out.Predictions… We will finish: 14th. Top four: 1. Man City 2. Liverpool 3. Tottenham 4. Chelsea. Bottom three: 18. Brighton 19. Newcastle 20. Norwich. First manager sacked: Steve Bruce.Realistically, the fight is to break into a regular European spot – but above all else, Evertonians want silverware: 24 years without it is far too long, so the cups have to be a priority for Marco Silva. Recovering from the disastrous KoemanAllardyce eras, Brands and Silva have their work cut out to reduce the squad while improving quality – but signing Digne, Gomes, Gbamin, Bernard and Delph suggests they are achieving that.Key menweak links Besides those new arrivals, Richarlison is key. Without a proven scorer – the mythical Everton No 9 – he’ll be under great pressure to improve on his 13 goals last year. Also keep an eye on Lewis Gibson, the central defender signed from Newcastle three years ago for £6m. He’s had injuries but has just had a very good pre-season.We need to sign In order: a forward – Moise Kean sounds close right-back cover for Coleman and central defence cover, given Zouma appears to be staying at Chelsea.Headline maker Farhad Moshiri’s impromptu appearances with his friend Jim White are good ground for unscripted comments. Jordan Pickford can have his moments, too.VAR: good or bad? Totally against it. There are already too many long stoppages disrupting the flow of the game. Besides which, to err is to be human.Predictions… We will finish: 4th – if we sign a proven scorer. If not, 6th to 8th. Top four: 1. Man City 2. Spurs 3. Arsenal 4. Everton. Bottom three: 18. Liverpool 19. Sheffield United 20. Brighton. First manager sacked: Roy Hodgson.Given the level of ambition we’ve shown in the window, it’s hard to feel anything but optimism right now. Lots of pundits are tipping us as outsiders for the top six – it’s a big ask but it’s definitely not impossible. In truth though, I’d rather see us lift the FA Cup.Key menweak links A lot was made of the Harry Maguire transfer saga, but him leaving for United hasn’t made my heart sink like the fleeting rumours of Juventus eyeing up Ricardo Pereira. Pereira was without doubt our best player last season – a stalwart in defence and attack. As for weaknesses: we’re still light up front. Vardy has been carrying the burden alone.We need to sign A winger. Albrighton’s unrelenting effort levels can produce only so much, and the likes of Gray and Ghezzal have routinely failed to deliver. Wilfried Zaha would be a major boost – but I won’t hold my breath.Headline maker It’s Jamie Vardy’s world, and we’re all just living in itVAR: good or bad? On paper it’s a good concept, but it hasn’t had a positive impact in other tournaments. I’m feeling quite pessimistic about it, frankly.Predictions… We will finish: 7th. Top four: 1. Man City 2. Liverpool 3. Tottenham 4. Arsenal. Bottom three: 18. Burnley 19. Brighton 20. Sheffield United. First manager sacked: Manuel Pellegrini.We’ll do well. Hopefully one place higher than last time. The fans are still basking in the glory of Madrid, and rightly so: we have to be optimistic, don’t we? We haven’t had the best pre-season but that counts for nothing when the real games kick in. And quite a few of our players only returned to training a week or so ago.Key menweak links The main men last season will be the main men again. It helps to have the best keeper, central defender, left-back and strike force in Europe. And Rhian Brewster is the obvious contender to break through after a year out injured. It’ll be interesting to see how he’s managed.We need to sign Some back-up, particularly if players such as Mignolet and Lovren go. We’d also benefit from a creative midfielder. Keïta showed in glimpses what he can do but injury stumped his progress. Eriksen would lift the pressure. And another striker could help. Origi is a deity but reinforcement from the bench is never a bad thing.Headline maker The boss, though maybe not so much for profanities this time around. Until we win the league, that is.VAR: good or bad? Hate it. It’s bad for obvious reasons: killing spontaneity, halting play, making the game about business full stop. Yes, the right decision prevails, but it does mostly anyway.Predictions…We will finish: 1st. Top four: 1. Liverpool 2. Man City 3. Tottenham 4. Arsenal. Bottom three: 18. Brighton 19.

After years of questing together, the friends, for whom the game had become the crucible in which their bonds had been made and reinforced, successfully plant the “Orb of Uncreation” into the slug queen’s egg sac and thereby triumphantly conclude the game’s story. The reward for the thousands of hours’ effort? A treasure chest containing a pair of red gloves.“No, this was totally, totally worth it,” murmurs one of the players into the head mic she uses to chat to her teammates (one of whom plays from the adjacent bedroom). “I’m so happy with my life choices.”It’s a joke about the fallacy of so much human endeavour, from stamp collecting to Westminster jostling: the hollow realisation that the appeal often lies in the striving, not the attaining. It also strikes at the heart of a truth about a certain kind of online video game, played at a certain point of early adulthood. Soon enough you discover that the game is merely the pretext to hang out with the people you met along the way. As the Dead Pixels characters mournfully say their goodbyes, one interjects, ecstatically, with the news that a story-elongating expansion has just been announced for the game. Blessed relief: the band can stay together.The story of Final Fantasy XIV’s development has its own enthralling arc. Released in September 2010, just as the genre’s popularity was peaking, the game was so poorly received it prompted a deep-bowing apology from its Japanese publisher’s president and the sacrificial resignation of its producer, one of the company’s longest-serving employees. The world was closed for a multimillion-yen refurbishment and, when in 2013 the doors were opened, the response from players was rapturous, making a hero of Naoki Yoshida, the underdog designer who had so successfully masterminded the refit.This, then, is Yoshida’s concluding chapter to the game’s story, which, for anyone looking to start from the beginning, s virtual continents and dimensions, and requires about as great an investment of time as reading the complete works of Tolstoy. There are items that can be used to boot a new character to the beginning of the latest chapter in the drama, but whichever route you take, this is a joyously refined example of a style of game that, in less sympathetic hands, can be repellently arcane.The dialogue is punchy, the characters well defined, and as you dash about the lavish world you soon get caught up in dramas both local and international. There are stirring set-piece battles, for which you’ll be automatically paired with other players, as well as smaller-scale errands, such as picking up items from local shops in exchange for information, and so on. You play as a hero, of course, but the world’s politics are fully formed, and yours is but one role in many required to win the war. You choose a class for your adventurer to fit your own temperament – knights, healers, samurai, gunslingers, dancers – and, away from the battlefield, you may put hours into perfecting your character’s outfit, choosing a pet or decorating your virtual homestead.Unlike most games, Final Fantasy XIV requires a Netflix-style monthly subscription, money used to keep the virtual world’s servers humming. While the developer is therefore incentivised to waste players’ time, those who stick to Shadowbringers’ main storyline will reach its heady climax within a few weeks. Then again, there’s always a chance you’ll make some genuine friends along the way, and the game, like the golf course, the bingo hall, the pub or the yacht club, will become a mere pretext for something more profound and lingering to blossom.Fire Emblem: Three Houses(Nintendo Switch)Since 1990, the Fire Emblem series has provided a kind of soap-opera rendering of chess, in which each piece has a name, backstory and romantic feelings. Emotional tension is ratcheted up by the fact that, if you allow a piece to fall during battle, he or she will be lost from the story for ever, a rule known in game design as “permadeath”.

In the case of Nick Hatton from Worcester that means covering the three miles from his home to where he now works as a cleaner at often antisocial hours. Last week, he wrote to ask if I’d consider reviewing his bike, because he was so delighted with it. “It’s an absolute bargain, “ he enthused. “I would recommend the Apollo to anybody struggling to get around, for work or pleasure. The price means keeping fit and travelling can be done in an affordable way.”I wrote back and asked why he’d chosen the Apollo. Nick soon replied: “The Job Centre offered me £120 towards the cost of a new bike. I was previously reliant on an old Barracuda my father had passed on to me, but it was costing me a fortune in inner tubes. I’ve had no maintenance issues with it at all. It’s great for roads and trails. It goes faster than my old mountain bike as it has thinner tyres, and the gears are great for hilly terrain, such as where I live.”I promised Nick I’d go along to my local Halfords to check out it out. The Apollo Transfer is the cheapest adult bike the store sells. It’s currently on sale at £104. It isn’t the chain’s bestseller that honour goes to the Pendleton Somerby (£280). I’ve been the owner of some very shoddy bikes in my time. I’ve had to live with creaking chains, rasping brakes and seats that make shooting sticks feel like club loungers, so I was prepared for the worst. The Apollo, however, came as a series of pleasant surprises.The first is that the frame is steel. Most ultra-cheap bikes use some form of aluminium alloy. This is so flimsy the tubework has to be swollen to offer any kind of strength. By using steel, the Apollo manages to look quite slick. The welding, which can resemble wrinkled keloid scarring, is smooth and flush. It’s heavy but not tank-like – the friendly assistant couldn’t tell me how much it actually weighed. (It’s 14kg – about average.) It has an 18-speed gearset and standard hybrid tyres rugged enough to cope with the crappiest tarmac surfaces. I felt that having 18 gears was overkill. I’d rather ride a 9-speed and have them throw in mudguards or a rack instead.To ride, it’s pleasant enough. But it’s like comparing a £4 bottle of wine with an £8 one. El cheapo vino gets the job done but it’s rough and rattles your teeth. The real question with short-term affordability is how much it will cost you in the long run. As Benjamin Franklin said: “The bitterness of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of low price is forgotten.”For the moment, though, it’s hard to argue with Nick’s positivity. He tells me cycling has changed his life and sparked an interest in exploring. “Recently, I made a 20-mile round trip to the Droitwich Food and Drink Festival,” he says. “I cycled along the canal to get there.” That’s biking at its best.Email Martin at martin.love@observer or follow him on Twitter@MartinLove166"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18155b78d1342206a87c133fcef1c6def85997dd/2_0_1195_717/master/1195.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1d06475d797f65cfc920fe26f2c11fd","title":"no deal brexit house prices jobs prices pensions","story":"Here’s what might happen to house prices, jobs, savings and pensions – and what you can do about itby  Patrick Collinson and  Miles BrignallWhat you can doMost people will sit tight and do nothing, preferring not to buy or sell during such uncertainty. The OBR sees property transactions falling by a fifth in the event of no deal, which is bad news for estate agents, removal companies and retailers of furniture, carpets and curtains.But there are always those who have to buy or sell because their job has moved or their family has expanded. What should they do? If you’re the seller, don’t fall for the estate agent’s trick of over-pricing a property to get the business, then slashing later to get a sale. Examine actual sold prices on your road – Zoopla has an easily searchable database – and take a bit off to reflect today’s market.Buyers have a choice defer a purchase until November to get clarity on Brexit (but if there is a deal, then prices could start moving up again) or make cheeky low-ball offers and see if a vendor is desperate enough to accept. How do you know a seller is desperate? One way is to search the property’s listing history – most sites will say how long ago it came to market, but won’t say if it was removed then relisted with a reduced price. But there are tricks, such as those listed at Propcision, to find old data from Google.There is far less data available on rental markets, but if a landlord tries to increase the rent in this market they’re having a laugh do your best to challenge it.What you can doThe other strategy is to take out a tracker mortgage that moves down (and up) in line with Bank of England base rate.However, buyers need to be aware that if interest rates went up substantially later on, payments would rise accordingly, says L\u0026ampC’s David Hollingworth. He says most buyers will still want to stick with a fixed-rate deal, given that they are still at very low historical levels, and buyers have the security of knowing what they paying for its term.What you can doSterling’s slide this week is the canary in the Brexit coal mine, as traders began marking the pound down to what they think it might be worth in the event of a no-deal exit. Against the euro, the pound fell below €1.10, while against the dollar it was heading to $1.20. A disorderly departure could see the pound fall to one-to-one parity against the euro and the dollar even before the 31 October deadline.One indication comes from betting company Boyle Sports. At the start of year it was giving punters odds of only 8-1 that the pound would collapse to be worth just one euro, but has slashed the odds to 3-1 that we’ll reach that point some time this year.What you can doIf you think the pound will continue to tumble, then buying your holiday money now makes sense, even at today’s depressed levels. Don’t ever buy currency at an airport bureau de change, where rates for euros are already fantastically low, with many giving you just 0.9 euros for each pound. Buy online and in advance for much better deals you’ll get around €1.06 for each pound from Travelex online this week. See our separate guide to getting the best deal on holiday money. The currency’s collapse would make everything in overseas resorts this summer more expensive. It’s probably too late for most people now, but late bookers may want to consider half-board or all-inclusive options to control the costs.There is also an argument for booking very early this year for travel such as ski holidays. If the pound falls heavily the tour operators will be forced to raise prices in sterling, so locking a price now may make sense. Or decide to take your next holiday in the UK.If you want to take a punt against sterling and make some money by trading, all you need is a credit card and an initial deposit of around £100-£200 to join online forex traders such as eToro, City Index and so on. The big high street banks also let you trade, with minimum deposits starting at £10,000. But forex trading is fantastically risky, and only those able to afford to lose a lot money should even begin trying.Workers with final salary-style pensions aren’t affected, as they have guarantees, but for everyone else, their pension pot depends on the performance of the stock market. Which way will markets go in a Brexit crash-out?Broadly speaking, domestically focused UK companies, which make most of their profits in the UK, will be obvious casualties and their share prices could fall heavily in the next few months. But the giants of the London stock market – such as BP, Shell, HSBC and Glaxo – make the vast majority of their profits in overseas markets, and are much better protected from Brexit. Indeed, as sterling plummets they are likely to rise in value, because their dollar earnings suddenly become worth much more in pounds.What you can doMost people think they can’t do anything about their company pension scheme, but they can.You have to find out who manages your pension scheme, and then see what level of control you have. For example, Legal \u0026amp General manages 14,000 pension schemes for 2.8 million workers across the UK, including those at GNM, the ’s parent group.Members can view the value of their pension, and make choices about where the money goes, picking between cash, equity (shares) and bonds (which pay fixed rates of interest but can also go up and down in value).If you are convinced that a Boris Johnson-led Brexit is going to be a calamity, that the economy will tank and UK corporate profits collapse, then you can choose to shift your pension into overseas shares.If you believe in a total disaster – a view not shared by investment experts – you could even choose to put all of your pension into a cash fund, which means it won’t be affected by a fall in the stock market. Alternatively, if you believe that no deal won’t be that bad, then that would suggest you buy into domestic UK companies which could enjoy a huge “relief rally”. But remember, going to any extremes in investing (ie, all your money in cash, or all in one particular market) is a very risky thing to do for the long term, with almost nobody able to expertly time their investments to catch major market swings.A  Money reader asked us this week what to do about his old privatisation and demutualisation shares in the event of no deal. He holds both Lloyds (as a result of the Halifax demutualisation) and Santander. Should he sell them, he asked, fearful that a no-deal Brexit will send them crashing.What you can doWe’re not going to give advice on inidual shares, but here are a few pointers. Lloyds is a UK-focused bank which makes nearly all its profits in the UK. Therefore it is in the bucket of shares not particularly attractive to worldwide investors, and if there is a recession after no deal, it is the most exposed to customers defaulting on their loans.But its shares have been weak for a long time. It was 72p a share just before the referendum, and is 52p now. It’s arguable that the damage from Brexit is already in the price, although it can always sink lower. It has returned to paying idends, so the yield on the shares is actually quite attractive. If you have no urgent financial need to sell, it may be worth holding for the long term, but expect bumps along the way.Santander is a global bank with a big British operation. So it is impacted by Brexit, but much less so than Lloyds. That said, its shares have, if anything, performed worse than Lloyds. They have fallen from €6.18 in 2017 to €3.90 this week. Maybe the lesson is that, after the financial crisis, investors are wary of banks, and that they will never again be growth stocks, and you should hold them instead for a steady supply of idends.What you can doRealistically, most people can do very little about the threat of job losses, particularly if they are in low-skilled positions.If your job does look at risk – car plants such as Ford and Vauxhall come to mind – about the best you can do is try to build up some savings to tide you over. According to the government’s Money Advice Service, “a good rule of thumb to give yourself a solid financial cushion is to have three months’ essential outgoings available in an instant access savings account”. But sadly few people are able to save that much. According to Aviva, low income families typically only have around £100 in savings.On a late autumn trip to the continent, after Britain has crashed out of the EU with no deal, you find yourself having been pulled over by a gendarme 20km outside Calais. Heshe will want to see your UK driving licence, your international driving permit (IDP 1968), your insurance green card, the car’s log book (V5 document) and a GB sticker. Tourists flying into the EU and hiring a car will also need an IDP in several countries including Italy, France and the Netherlands. It is this that is likely to catch out future travellers.What you should doIf you are heading abroad after 31 October, you need to take all these items with you. The Post Office will sell you an IDP for £5.50 – you’ll need to show your UK licence and passport. But they will only be required in some countries following a no-deal Brexit tourists hiring a car in Spain or Portugal won’t need one for stays of up to six months.If there is a deal, UK licence holders will continue to be able to drive using their UK driving licence while visiting all EU and EEA countries. Your car insurer will supply your green card.A no-deal crash-out leaves many of the 1.3 million Brits living in the EU facing a major problem – what will happen if they are rushed to their local hospital? A no-deal departure ends the UK’s involvement in the European health insurance card scheme and other agreements overnight. While it is bad news for holidaymakers, it has the potential to force many of those who live in the EU to abandon their dream.What you can doFor those going on holiday, it is simply a case of buying travel insurance before you leave, and the government is advising just that. For those living abroad, Spain has said it will guarantee continued healthcare access to British expats and tourists in the country until the end of 2020 – provided the UK offers Spaniards here the same deal.This is highly likely as the UK government has said seeking bilateral agreements to maintain healthcare rights is a top priority.In France, another country in which lots of retired Brits live, the position is more complicated, particularly for those who are more temporary – spending just six months there at a time. They are being advised to formalise their residency where they can.It’s been reported that France is confident of reaching a bilateral agreement with the UK on health care – helped no doubt by the fact that there are lots of French people living and working in London.Other countries face the same challenge. The problem for some Brits is that those agreements will not be in position by 31 October. Those with dangerous ailments may have to consider returning to the UK temporarily.Medicine availability is what vexes people more seriously. Critical and short shelf-life medicines – some of which may need to be refrigerated until they are consumed – would be most vulnerable in a no-deal scenario, with fears they could be held up amid chaos at the ports.Already there are reports of diabetics informally stockpiling their own supplies of insulin by giving themselves less on a daily basis, with potentially dangerous consequences.But the government says the fears are misplaced, as drug companies have already been told to build up an additional six weeks’ supply of medicines to provide a buffer in the event of gridlock at Dover.What you can doThis suggests that if you have an eye on a new BMW or Mercedes, it might be worth bringing forward your purchase to before October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68891ee0d34b98c14b3459cc1c3a9772052b76c9/0_36_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dea8d020919b4fb18b4b4681cd3b6fc","title":"airport delays flight cancel compensation eu rules","story":"It should be the start of the holiday but for too many travellers the airport marks the start of a nightmare. The recent heatwave across Europe brought thunderstorms which left thousands stranded in UK airports having to endure cancellations and delays with many sleeping on the floor as hotels ran out of space.And the coming weeks could see a series of further disruptions with the possibility of strikes looming. This week, the results of a ballot of members of Ryanair’s pilot union will emerge after a vote on strike action in a dispute over working conditions.Meanwhile, possible strikes by British Airways pilots could also cause disruption after the airline lost a second legal attempt to block industrial action last week.So what consumer rights do travellers need to be aware of?European Union law kicks in for passengers on flights which originate in the EU or arrive there and are operated by an EU airline.The next question is how long was the delay. If more than two hours for short-haul (less than 1,500km), three hours for a medium-haul (1,500-3,500km) and more than four hours for long-haul (over 3,500km), then passengers are entitled to food, drink and access to communications such as a phone, as well as accommodation if the delay is overnight. If it is for more than five hours, passengers are entitled to a refund if they don’t want to travel any more.Compensation may be due if the fault was the airline’s. “For instance, you can probably claim if the delay was caused by poor aircraft maintenance or flight crew being unavailable,” says the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). “However, delays caused by things like extreme weather, air traffic control or airport employee strikes, situations where the entire airport was closed or other ‘extraordinary circumstances’ are not eligible for compensation.”Levels of compensation are again dictated by distance and time and range from €250 for a three-hour delay on a short-haul flight to €600 for delays of more than four hours on a long-haul journey.If a flight is cancelled, passengers can’t be left stranded. Under EU laws, they can get their money back for the parts of the ticket which have not been used, such as a leg of a return ticket. If they still want to fly, then the airline is obliged to find another flight, whether it be as soon as possible or at a later date.If flights are extremely heavily booked, travellers may find that the next flight available is several days away. Compensation may be available if less than 14 days notice of the cancellation is given, but this again depends on the cause, with the “extraordinary circumstances” get-out a possibility.If compensation is available, it again depends on distance and time, going from €125 for a flight that arrives two hours later than an original short-haul flight was expected, to the €600 for a long-haul replacement flight that arrives four hours later than the original was expected.With the prospect of strikes looming, it is good practice for travellers to know where they stand if they face delays or have their flights cancelled. Airlines are not normally obliged to offer compensation as strikes are deemed extraordinary circumstances. This is not always the case, however.“Under EU rules, strikes may be considered as ‘extraordinary circumstances’, which means the airline does not have to pay compensation. To be exempted from paying compensation, the airline must prove that: A, there is a link between the extraordinary circumstances and the delay or the cancellation and B, the delay or cancellation could not have been avoided, even if all reasonable measures had been taken,” according to the European Commission’s Europa.eu. If passengers are unhappy with the explanation, they should contact the CAA.Naomi Leach of Which? says that in the case of strikes by BA and Ryanair staff, there may be compensation due. “If delays or cancellations are a result of the airline’s own staff striking, passengers may be entitled to fixed compensation under EU law as this won’t usually be considered an extraordinary circumstance,” she adds.The first port of call when seeking redress for delays or cancellation should be the airline, not the travel insurer, which is unlikely to be of much help, according to Which? “It is worth checking what travel insurance you already have – many bank accounts, for example, may include holiday cover. But even if your travel insurance policy does offer compensation for a delay, in most cases this will only cover extra expenses such as food and drink at the airport,” says Leach.In the case of holidays having to be abandoned as a result of severe delays or cancellations at a busy time, such as during the calamitous drone incident at Gatwick last year, a decent travel insurance policy should cover the cost of travellers having to abandon their plans – including hotel and car hire cancellation at their destination."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a2655bada45aa983ddb7a03d59c5b63dc7a85a0/0_2_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=885bf50ce171bf4138ab121a177f9106","title":"we cant get carried away readers on lib dem byelection win jane dodds brecon and radnorshire","story":"You have been reacting to Jane Dodds’ win in Brecon and Radnorshire, a result cutting Boris Johnson’s majority to oneOne cannot view Brecon and Radnor as an ordinary constituency, this was a Lib Dem stronghold even during Blairs most successful years, the profile of the constituency is very middle class and a world away from the poverty of the Valleys or the eastern suburbs of London. The fact is that a lot of people living around Brecon are more insulated from the problems of society than people living elsewhere. Oliver ElkingtonA pretty close result in the end. Tory party would have held it if Brexit party hadn’t taken so many votes, or if GreensPlaid had not stood aside. The Brexit debacle is so serious party politics should take a back seat. Hopefully the progressive alliance will hold and Borish Johnson will be too up himself to get a pact going with Farage. Not sure where Labour fit in the battle of the coalitions, but not a great night for them either. RedSalamanderI’m delighted that a party which unequivocally opposes Brexit won last night.But we shouldn’t get carried away. Johnson will be pretty relieved at how the Conservative vote held up and if you add Conservative and Brexit Party vote share together, then their combined vote is higher than the Lib Dems. He will push the line that if you want Brexit delivered, you have to swing behind the Conservatives.On Labour: nobody is fooled by Corbyn’s ‘“constructive ambiguity” any more. It’s blatantly obvious that he wants Brexit and all his dithering and vagueness is intended to mug off his own party. TheGoodThiefThe remain-alliance’s total votes are less than the Conservative plus Brexit plus UKIP total, so expect plenty of politicians saying that this shows that the Tories need to move to a harder Brexit.More interesting to me is the Brexit politicians who are saying that they wouldn’t vote for a version of the withdrawal agreement without the backstop, showing that Boris Johnson either doesn’t know his own party, or has been lying whenever he’s suggested that a WA without the backstop could pass Parliament. octaariThe polls tell us there is a Boris Johnson bounce – they are back in the lead. And given the circumstances of this by-election, a seat they’d been widely expected to lose heavily from what I’ve read over the past few weeks, the narrow losing margin seems to confirm that.What the result shows is what can be achieved through electoral alliances. The winning margin was about the same as Plaid Cymru’s vote at the last election, and they didn’t stand this time. The Brexit Party’s 3,300 votes would have given the Tories a comfortable majority. Very grim result for Labour. stringvestorThere is still a substantial pro-Brexit vote out there. That is not surprising since we have not yet left the EU and what might happen is still speculation. Whereas we are still in the EU and people can blame everything they do not like on Brussels. Let’s see how the Brexit vote holds up after we have left and the consequences start to kick in.

It’s not just that Jane Dodds, the newly elected Liberal Democrat MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, will be a great representative, of which I’m sure – it’s more significant than that. If I had a pound for every exasperated person who asked me why the Remain parties couldn’t get their act together during the recent European elections, I’d be typing this from a tropical island with a cocktail on the go.Millions of people in Britain are looking to their MPs to step up, put traditional party allegiances aside and work together in the national interest. By not fielding candidates in the Brecon byelection, the other Remain parties – principally the Greens, Plaid Cymru, the Independent Group for Change, and Renew – have demonstrated it is indeed possible. Halle-bloody-lujah.Coming to politics from business and being elected as MP for South Cambridgeshire in 2015, party tribalism is anathema to me. In this job, shouldn’t we all be working in the country’s best interests? And on the big issues, shouldn’t we be searching for the right and best answers, blind to the colour of a rosette?Wildly optimistic – even naive, you may think – but I make no apologies for feeling that passionately. And on the biggest issue facing the UK’s economic future and security for generations, I’ll keep pushing for cross-party working for as long as I’m privileged to be in a position of influence.So hats off to the leaders of those Remain parties and independent MPs who believe we have to try, too. The threat of a Boris Johnson premiership is no longer a threat – it’s a living, breathing, capital punishment-supporting home secretary, billion-pound no-deal spending chancellor reality. And it terrifies me.But there is an antidote in the form of an alliance. Unite to Remain, a project I launched a few weeks ago in anticipation of a general election, seeks similar agreements to that secured in the Brecon byelection in as many seats across England and Wales as would make a difference.And we must do this, because if we continue to work along traditional party lines, we will split our vote, allowing the ideological fringes of our politics to win. Think Johnson, think Nigel Farage, think Jeremy Corbyn. I think not.I’ve been inspired by the reaction and enthusiasm of the Remain parties and independent MPs. Their determination, progressive and country-first thinking have surpassed my expectations. This is the maturity I’ve been desperate to see in my fellow MPs – what a shame it was in such short supply in the party I once represented.Acting as the facilitator – providing resources, latest polling, data insights and donations in the biggest drive yet to equalise the ability of Remain parties and free-thinking independent MPs – Unite to Remain will help to break through the first-past-the-post electoral system.And the prize for breaking every party allegiance rule? Returning a significant number of multiparty, pro-Remain, outward-looking, global, progressive MPs to Westminster – and then we shift the Brexit dial and change the path our country is heading down.Beyond remaining in the EU, pushing for proportional representation and faster action on climate change, I don’t expect this coalition of hope to agree on everything and last for ever. But for one general election only, I know we can do this.Heidi Allen, once a Tory MP, is now an independent MP and is chair of the cross-party initiative Unite to Remain"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6526bdf6cd127d4734f6a8fe4b4d5cc94af4e2b4/0_187_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b630d30ee83983cb0b496843fb8bb2f","title":"liz truss trade deal food safety deregulation","story":"Fears for weakening of UK’s food safety and animal welfare standards in any deal with AmericaThe cabinet minister in charge of negotiating a new US trade deal met with a series of rightwing American thinktanks to discuss deregulation and the benefits of “Reaganomics”, new documents have revealed.Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, had a number of meetings with libertarian groups that have championed parts of Donald Trump’s deregulatory agenda and tax cuts.New details of her three-day visit to Washington last September have been uncovered by Greenpeace’s investigative journalism team, Unearthed. Truss met senior representatives from the Heritage Foundation, a thinktank committed to shrinking the state and cutting environmental regulation, to discuss “regulatory reform”. Also at the meeting was the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Both groups were part of the “shadow trade talks” project, designed to advocate a wide-ranging US trade deal allowing the import of American goods currently banned in Britain.One briefing note reveals that Truss was keen to hear “what we can learn from ‘Reaganomics’ on things like regulation and red tape”. Truss also planned to tell the Heritage Foundation that she is “committed to”, and “personally interested in”, exploring similar reforms in the UK. “Reaganomics” is shorthand for the policies of the former Republican US president Ronald Reagan, based on tax cuts and deregulation.Truss has made no secret of her interest in cutting the size of the state. However, she is now in charge of Britain’s post-Brexit trade deals in a government committed to leaving the EU with no deal if necessary. Many fear a no-deal Brexit will pave the way for a weakening of UK food and environment protections. The US agricultural sector has insisted that any deal scraps restrictions on chlorinated chicken, hormone-treated beef, and pesticide usage currently circumscribed by the EU.John Sauven, Greenpeace’s executive director, said: “There are widespread concerns that Brexit will be used to weaken our safeguards on food safety and animal welfare, opening the floodgates to products such as chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef. These concerns will only grow at the discovery that the minister in charge of forging a trade deal with the US flew to a libertarian boot camp run by Donald Trump’s buddies to be lectured about the supposed benefits of ditching regulations.“Boris Johnson promised that a trade deal with the US would not jeopardise our food and animal welfare standards. People will be watching closely to see whether these words mean anything at all.”Truss also met the chief economist of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), which involved a discussion of the success of Trump’s efforts to deregulate the US economy. ALEC has lobbied against action on climate change, with companies including Shell, BP and ExxonMobil quitting involvement in it as a result. Another document has revealed that an official from the Foreign Office wrote to another free-market thinktank, R Street Institute, on Truss’s behalf requesting a meeting to discuss “business deregulation”.A government spokesperson said: “We are committed to negotiating an ambitious free-trade agreement with the US. Without exception, imports into the UK will meet our stringent food safety and animal welfare standards.

Babe Zaharias, Mickey Wright, Pat Bradley, Inbee Park, Ben Hogan and Tiger Woods are the only players to win three majors in the same year. Should Ko prevail here, she will make this group a septet with the added quirk of two major triumphs arriving in two weeks. Hogan, Woods et al did not manage that.There are, however, similarities between Ko and Brooks Koepka. The 24-year-old from Seoul has won three times in standard LPGA Tour events like Koepka her obvious specialism is the majors. There is also a score to settle in this event, given Ko was beaten into second place by Park at Turnberry in 2015.Given 2019 form, Ko’s charge through the field was the most striking aspect of round three. Victories at the ANA Inspiration and Evian Championship mean this run would have been just as notable to other players in the British Open field. Ko reached the turn in 33 before chipping in from behind the 16th when en route to a 68. Her 10-under tally leaves her within striking distance of the lead. Ko watched a birdie putt at the last dance agonisingly past the cup.Ko’s leaderboard placing feels like a formality. Not so Hinako Shibuno, who chased down Ashleigh Buhai in stunning style on Saturday afternoon. Buhai led by five - and Shibuno by six - before a dramatic turnaround. The South African’s 72 means she now trails Shibuno’s 14 under par by two. The 20-year-old Shibuno is a major debutante, as not at all apparent during her 67.It is tribute to Carlota Ciganda that she was not in the least overwhelmed by the latest Ko major show until the 18th. The 29-year-old Spaniard, playing alongside Ko, was five under for her round before encountering awful bother at the bottom of a hedge to the right of the last. The upshot was an ugly double bogey six, meaning a third 69 and a nine-under total.“If that drive was one metre to the left, I had a shot into the green,” said Ciganda. “But there were so many positives out there. I want to focus on them.”Morgan Pressel, hoping for a wildcard pick for the US Solheim Cup team, boosted her chances considerably with a third round of 66. Pressel’s back nine was of 32 shots. At 10-under par, she may yet have a strong say in the outcome of this major.The bigger picture relates to Pressel placing herself firmly at the forefront of Solheim permutations as some of her more illustrious compatriots struggle. Paula Creamer, Cristie Kerr and Stacy Lewis all missed the cut here.Georgia Hall’s hopes of a successful title defence most likely ended within nine holes on Saturday. The champion from last year at Royal Lytham \u0026amp St Annes reached the turn in 37, with a double bogey at the 9th emphasising Hall’s frustrations. Back-to-back bogeys from the 12th meant further damage. Hall’s 74 – her highest score of the week by five – slid her back to four under par and realistically aiming for a top-10 finish at best.Charley Hull looked to be heading in the same direction as Hall after playing the front half in two-over-par 38. The Woburn member, who has commanded massive support, responded defiantly, though, with birdies at the 11th, 12th, 13th and 15th. On the 14th Hull passed up a glorious opportunity. Hull’s 70 moved her to minus nine. She is still in the mix."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/465c544f382c9eee92e17b7dd62dc94ff0332b63/359_102_4412_2647/master/4412.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38dcfd01b08329929db2d4bed1dde4aa","title":"max verstappen f1 hungarian grand prix lewis hamilton","story":"Already adored by the hordes of orange-swathed fans who flock to grands prix in Europe, Max Verstappen gave them reason to roar until they were hoarse in Hungary. In claiming the first pole position of his career at the Hungarian Grand Prix he also became the first Dutch driver to claim the top spot in Formula One. It was, moreover, a further statement of his talent and another more than welcome challenge to the Mercedes F1 hegemony.Verstappen did so for Red Bull with a flawless lap of the Hungaroring, although pushed to the limit by the Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas, who is in second place. Lewis Hamilton, also for Mercedes, is third with Charles Leclerc next, heading Sebastian Vettel, in the Ferraris.Pole has been a long time coming for a man who is still deceptively young. Verstappen is only 21 but is in his fifth season in F1. Having become the youngest driver to compete in the sport, and its youngest winner, he was entirely unconcerned that he was only its fourth youngest driver to claim pole. He has matured so much in those five years that, while he was elated with the place, there was also the calm consideration of a driver who knows the real business begins on Sunday.“It’s incredible,” he said. “This was still missing. The car felt good all weekend. I’m very happy about today but there’s still a race to do and that’s the most important.”He has every reason to be confident for the race as well, with two wins from three races and with the Red Bull displaying a remarkable turn of pace around a track which plays to their aerodynamic strengths. Verstappen clearly had the balance and stability required for the frequent direction changes at the Hungaroring and was able to exploit them.He did so with some style. He went quickest on his first hot run in Q3 with a time of 1min 14.958sec, almost two tenths clear of both Bottas in second and Hamilton in third. That was a mighty advantage to overcome but, much as Bottas tried, he could make little impression. Indeed Verstappen found even more on his second run. Pushing his Red Bull to the edge, he was on another level on his last lap, when he went almost half a second quicker with 1min 14.572sec. It was superb.Bottas followed him to within a hundredth but could not match him. Hamilton, despite looking strong this weekend, was almost two-tenths back.There were rightly celebrations at Red Bull for their first pole this season and with the engine manufacturer Honda, for whom it is a first pole since Jenson Button took the top spot at Australia in 2006.Hamilton was disappointed in being unable to challenge harder. “The car wasn’t the same as it was in third practice,” he said.“It was a bit of a struggle, just plateaued. It didn’t really get better. But we’re still in the fight, hopefully for the race we’ll have better race pace.”There were smiles, however, at the other end of the pitlane, as Williams turned in their best qualifying of the year. Having finally brought the aero upgrades they have been waiting for to Germany it paid off in Hungary, with George Russell in 16th. It was a superb run and the first time Williams have not been slowest on track in qualifying this year. Optimism that they can move closer to the midfield looks justified.Ferrari had expected to be under the cosh through the slow and medium-speed corners of the Hungaroring but Leclerc did not help their cause. He lost the rear, too hot into the final corner and spun into the wall in Q1, taking minor damage. Remarkably his car was still able to put in good times and he did well to take fourth.The day, however, belonged emphatically to Verstappen, continuing a strong and consistent opening to the season. He is third in the world championship, 63 points behind Hamilton and 21 in front of Vettel and there was optimism there would be more reasons for the Dutch fans to celebrate come Sunday.“We know that, if you can start upfront for the race, it makes it easier to control,” he said.“We have been working really hard to improve the engine in quali to get more out if it. That showed today. We keep improving.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1897475c55ec1a412a30d40ba53bfdfe66481586/142_60_2601_1561/master/2601.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=097a5f526347c967764e9292db650393","title":"frankie dettori racing twilight twirl","story":"At 48 the Italian looks likely to surpass anything he has done before and in doing so is rewriting sporting historyIn the late 1990s, when Frankie Dettori was already well-established as the biggest name in racing, he happened to be sitting at the next table to mine at the Lesters, an annual awards when, for one night only, Britain’s jockeys let their hair down and party. Dinner was served, a waiter appeared to offer him a selection of vegetables and for several seconds Dettori cast a melancholic gaze at a tray of buttered new potatoes with a look that said much about the denial in a jockey’s life. Fame, fortune and Classic winners are fine but for a moment he looked ready to give it all up for a plate of spuds.He certainly did not look like someone who would still be riding big-race winners at 48, and an extended career seemed more implausible still when he was banned from the saddle for six months in December 2012, having tested positive for cocaine after a ride in France. By then Dettori had already lost the retainer with Sheikh Mohammed’s Godolphin operation that had guaranteed a steady supply of champions to ride for 20 years. He could look forward only to grubbing around in racing’s undergrowth when he returned to action – if he returned to action at all.Seven years later Dettori is not only back at the pinnacle of his profession but quite possibly in the middle of the best season of his entire career. The glory years with Godolphin were good but at his current rate of progress never as good as this. In 2001 Dettori rode 16 Group One or Grade One winners. This season he has already bagged 11, with the biggest prizes of the campaign still to come.All sports offer up examples of champions and legends who competed well into their 30s or even their 40s. Stanley Matthews and WG Grace were still playing in their 50s. And no round-up of sporting veterans would be complete without a mention for Gordie Howe, who played ice hockey in the NHL across five different decades and was the originator of the “Gordie Howe Hat-Trick”: a goal, an assist and a fight, all in the same game.Superstars, all of them. But how many sporting greats were at their very best, or even close, in their final years? And how many had a season in the twilight of their careers that not only matched but bettered anything that had gone before? Roger Federer remains a marvel, able to reach and almost win a Wimbledon men’s final at 37, but he is never going to improve on his 2006 season, when he reached all four grand slam finals and won three.Dettori, though, is six Group One winners away from the best season of his life, 32 years after riding his first winner in June 1987. That, admittedly, is six more than most jockeys can hope to win in their entire careers and will not be easily achieved. Legendary status does not confer immunity from injury either, as Jimmy Anderson knows only too well. As recently as Friday Dettori was thrown when his horse stumbled just after the line. He needs to stay lucky. But if he can maintain his current strike-rate, Dettori will win his 17th Group One race of 2019 some time before he arrives at Longchamp in early October to ride the almost equally astonishing Enable in her attempt to win an unprecedented third Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe. That meeting marks the start of a frantic six weeks of championship racing in Europe and beyond that will offer many more opportunities to add to his career total of nearly 250 top-level wins.Lester Piggott is the only other jockey in the last half-century to approach Dettori’s level of success, public recognition and durability. He was the champion jockey 11 times while Dettori has claimed only three titles, in 1994, 1995 and 2004 (although one could have stopped 100 people on the street in every year since and asked them to name the champion jockey and Dettori would have topped the poll every time). Piggott also rode a Classic winner at 56 and came up with one of the greatest rides of all time on Royal Academy a few weeks after reapplying for a jockey’s licence and two years after he emerged from prison, having served 12 months for tax evasion.But while one could argue which of Piggott’s many seasons in the saddle was the greatest, the obvious candidates are in the 60s and 70s, probably headed up by Nijinsky’s Triple Crown season in 1970. Dettori, at 48, is raising his own bar.Some may argue that comparisons with other sports are meaningless. In racing, after all, the horse is the primary athlete. Falls are, thankfully, occasional and Dettori does not have to put up with the constant, bone-shaking batterings that, say, an NFL quarterback like Tom Brady – who won his sixth Super Bowl at 41 this year – accepts as routine. So it is worth considering what it is that a jockey actually does.A rider cannot turn a donkey into a Derby winner or persuade any horse to run any faster than its genes and physiology allow. The job is to steer a path from the starting stalls to the finishing line as quickly and efficiently as possible while a dozen or more fellow jockeys are trying to do the same and it requires a rare blend of strength, balance and quicksilver thinking amid the bustle and bedlam of a race. A horse covers five lengths per second in the closing stages of a race. Losing 0.02sec in the course of a one-and-half-mile contest could be the difference between victory and defeat.The passage of time should really take its toll on all of a jockey’s essential qualities, not least when many Flat riders in particular are operating on a diet that teeters on the edge of malnourishment. But Dettori’s powers seem stronger than ever. Every racing fan has a favourite Dettori moment from the past 30 years, and for many it may still be the seventh winner at Ascot on his day of all days.My pick would be the Breeders’ Cup Classic at Santa Anita in 2008, when Dettori was riding Raven’s Pass against Curlin, the hot favourite and winner of the race a year earlier. The track commentator gave Curlin a huge shout on the turn for home – “and look at Curlin go … is this believable?” – but even as he charged round the turn, the eye was drawn to the horse and jockey who had followed him throughout as if attached to the favourite by a tow-rope. It remains the only win in the Classic for a horse trained in Great Britain, and Dettori – a late replacement for Jimmy Fortune – was at his brilliant best.He is still adding fresh memories too, including a four-timer that nearly brought the betting industry to its knees at Ascot two months ago. Enable is heading for Paris, and Too Darn Hot, this week’s Sussex Stakes winner, towards the Breeders’ Cup Mile. Flat racing needs to cherish these moments because it does not get better than this."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2391ddee73db5b5353cb61ce7bd3b8fd3c58b9e1/0_125_5184_3111/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9f06a99e92ad96530dab739c9fa8c18","title":"england v australia ashes 2019 first test day four live","story":"40th over: Australia 147-3 (Smith 58, Head 27) Moeen Ali to Travis Head, who is trying to be proactive and shift his weight in the crease, even when blocking or leaving. He still can’t help playing one Travis Head shot though, leaning back and trying to carve a ball that was too close and too fast, missing it entirely. Head always looks like he’s about to get out, but more often than not he has a stack of runs to his name by the time that happens. Don’t blink. Gets a single from the last ball.39th over: Australia 146-3 (Smith 58, Head 26) Smith just keeps doing what Smith does: stepping across, nullifying the line of the ball, blocking it back, finding a single. But Broad is good enough, once in this over, to land it a fraction wider, get a fraction of movement, and beat the edge! Smith may not get out very often, but when he does get out he nicks off to slip like everyone else. 38th over: Australia 144-3 (Smith 57, Head 25) Travis Head is starting to settle, and they play Moeen in one-day middle-overs mould. Single, singles, four of them in total. Milk and bilk. Robert Grey emails in, bravely. “I was in the Hollies yesterday and have now just landed in Stockholm (bringing the hangover with me). I fear the missing strike bowler in our attack is a fatal flaw in this Test. Let’s just please build some genuine pressure against Smith. How about posting the hives, tic-tic-boom to wrap this email up nicely?”Rob, the hives are what I have after watching Rory Burns bat.37th over: Australia 140-3 (Smith 55, Head 23) Broad is bowling really well to Smith, full around off stump, forcing defensive shots but with just a length just short enough to move the ball after pitching. Smith waits on a couple, and then, wonder of wonders, miracle of miracles, plays a false shot! What was trying to do there? He whipped his wrists through a relatively full ball, and I think he may have been trying to get that to the leg side? Instead it took a leading edge and went airborne through cover, into the gap between cover and mid-off! We can’t examine the shot more closely because the TV is content to show 83 replays of England players with their hands on their heads. Great content. The lead is 50.Whoah, Jimmy Jimmy has instead become Woe Jimmy Jimmy. No surprises here, but he officially won’t bowl again in this match. 36th over: Australia 136-3 (Smith 51, Head 23) Right, Smith might have solved the Broad strike problem for now. Gets a single from Moeen fourth ball. The off-spinner then shreds one out of the left-hander’s rough to beat Head’s outside edge, then keep low through Bairstow’s legs for four byes. Nothing to see here, spinners. Nothing to see. Australia lead by 46 and Lyon might defend that, at this rate.Kim Thonger emails in “In all the talk about finding a way to get Smith out, we’re forgetting the thorn in our side that is Peter Siddle. I’ve got a shiny 50p piece on him getting the Aussies up to a 200+ lead even if we bag Smith for not much early on.”35th over: Australia 131-3 (Smith 50, Head 23) Broad to Smith, and he just wheels the bat around like hands on a clock face and effortless eases the ball behind point for his 50th run. His hundred in the first innings drew him level: 24 tons and 24 fifties. Now he’s on to 25 fifties, but could invert that if he converts it. Stats, hey?The problem with that single is that it brings Head back on strike to Broad, which is a Bad Idea officially for Australia. Head responds to the doubters by playing a horrendous diagonal heave at a ball outside off, all bottom hand. That’s exactly how to play good seam bowling on an English deck, lad.34th over: Australia 130-3 (Smith 49, Head 23) Moeen recovers from his carnival sideshow of a first over and lands quite nicely on the spot for his second. Spins one off a thick inside edge from Smith away into the leg side. England need Mo to do a job today. 33rd over: Australia 129-3 (Smith 48, Head 23) Thanks JP! Geoff Lemon here, taking over as play gets underway. Good morning all. Adjust your email and Twitter settings accordingly if you wouldn’t mind. Tim Paine could probably repurpose some Churchill today: “Never have so many relied so heavily on so few,” or thereabouts. By which I mean to say, never have I felt that an Ashes Test has relied so entirely on one player. If England get Smith this morning, they win. If they don’t for two or three hours, they lose. Stuart Broad – big, bad, and better than his Dad – starts his day against Travis Head, left-handed and flighty. Sears the ball in from around the wicket and there’s a huge shout! That was hitting leg stump, surely! Umpire says no. Computer says maybe. Clipping leg. I was giving it. I’m still giving it. England didn’t review. It wouldn’t have been out, but phew. Close.Another shout next ball! This one missing leg properly. But Head can’t get bat on it when Broad bowls full and straight. So Broad bowls short and wide instead. There is a galaxy within you will never understand his mysteries.32nd over: Australia 129-3 (Smith 48, Head 23) My oh my oh my... Moeen Ali begins proceedings and his first ball is a rancid grubber that pitches and scuttles no more than ankle high towards Smith who is alert enough to nurdle a single. After Head calmly rotates strike Ali then sends down a wild lobbed grenade that beats Smith at head height for an awful no-ball. Smith tried to swat it away but failed to connect. An eventful start to the day. The players are out in the middle and day four is underway!Australian TV is broadcasting a pre-recorded interview with Travis Head and the man who will start play in partnership with Steve Smith has said Australia are targeting a lead of 250-plus. The strategy is to see off the opening hour or so and then cash-in once the ball has softened. Are we remiss for not considering Joe Denly’s leg-spin as a serious factor in the outcome of this match? After all, he was selected in touring parties for his ability to operate as an auxiliary member of the attack on decks such as these. How do you solve a problem like Steve Smith? Mark Taylor, on Australian TV, says bowl a fourth to fifth stump line and remain patient. Easier said than done of course. Abhijato Sensarma has emailed in to ask if I would pick Bancroft for the next Test. Short answer: yes. If the Australian brains trust think he’s the right man for the opening Test then it would be harsh to hook him after just two knocks. Clearly he can’t continue to score poorly but the solidity of his place also depends on the form of Marcus Harris, the only other opener among the tour party. Morning Stuie. Hard not to think Smith is key to all of this. If he fails to last an hour you can see England racing away with things. If he’s entrenched after lunch the balance of power swings. Should Australia set a chase of 200 I’d put them favourites. Anything under 150 it’s England’s to lose. Small margins. Leanne Indaimo wins the prize for the first email of the day. “I noted with interest that yesterday one of the bloggers commented that he liked to think if he grew up in a non cricketing country that he would be a cricket fan,” she emails. “I am writing to say that this is possible. My son was born in England and since he was five grew up in Italy, a cricket desert. I can say that thanks to the brainwashing of his Aussie parents he is a huge fan of the game. Obsessive even. Despite his English birthplace he is of course a dinky die true blue Aussie supporter. He is now living back in England about to experience his first Ashes series on enemy soil. He has no idea what he is in for!!”. Lovely stuff. Perhaps your son could now throw his allegiance behind Janjua Cricket Club Brescia in the new European Cricket League? The Australian spin on things is provided by Geoff Lemon and yesterday he was as interested in the behaviour of Steve Smith in the field as he was at the crease.The interesting thing about this is that Smith has not finished his punishment. His year-long ban from playing has ended, but not the second year’s ban from holding leadership positions in any Australia team. So it was equally interesting to see him in the slip cordon as Australia tried to take the last few English first-innings wickets, directing traffic in the field as smoothly as he ever did while captain.Today’s global TMS link. For overseas listeners only. If you’re in the UK, grab their coverage in the usual BBC places. Here it is, with thanks to Peter Haining for sending it through. In Anderson’s absence Stuart Broad has led the attack manfully. Barney Ronay has reminds us how the often maligned paceman raises his game to match the stakes. Broad has loved these contests. Unlike Anderson, whose numbers take a e against the Aussies, Broad’s game rises to meet England’s most consistently cussed opponents, particularly in the English summer.The sight of a limping Anderson hobbling the winning run late on Monday evening would be something to behold. Mo, Mo, Mooooo, how d’you like it? How d’you like it?Nobody seems to have any idea how to dislodge the most fidgety and idiosyncratic of batsmen but Chris Woakes is a man with a plan, possibly, as Ali Martin reports.Much has been made of the hostility from English crowds towards Australia’s players in this series but Tim Adams has sketched a much more promising scene from the Edgbaston outer where pantomime villain Smith is winning over the home support. The stages of Smith’s 144 runs were like a fast-forward primer in theories of the tribal language of crowds. Smith’s first 50 runs were greeted with solid animosity from the home crowd his vivid century was first booed and then almost immediately applauded, often by the same people. Detractors had wavered and then become converts. By the time the Australian’s innings closed, as the evening sun was on the ground, most of the English crowd were quite happy to give him the rich ovation his brilliance and fortitude deserved.If you want to remind yourself of the state of play then tuck into Vic Marks’ report from stumps on day three.Yet again Steve Smith is the obstacle driving the English to distraction. While he is still at the crease nothing can be guaranteed. In front of another packed house here England made some solid progress: a first-innings lead of 90 and three early scalps when Australia batted again. But Smith, who reminded us on the first day how he can transform an innings, remained.Weather: There’s already more than enough tension in this contest but if you wanted some more, how about the prospect of some inclement weather this afternoon? It’s currently fine and cool in the West Midlands but there is the strong risk of a rain-related interruption or two after lunch. In case you hadn’t realised already, I should point out I am not Geoff Lemon. He will be with you before play begins but for the time being please forward any email correspondence to jonathan.howcroft.casual@the or tweets to @JPHowcroft. Good morning everybody and welcome to day four of the first Ashes Test from Edgbaston. This contest is beautifully poised with Australia resuming their second innings leading by 34 runs with seven wickets in hand. With the pitch offering diminishing returns for the seamers and the Dukes ball failing to swing there will be enormous pressure on the shoulders of Moeen Ali to spin England to the brink of victory this morning. Should Australia bat on much beyond lunch the nerves around Edgbaston will be jangling loudly. A target in excess of 150 will be tricky to chase against an Australian attack containing Nathan Lyon on a surface offering plenty to the off-spinner.The opening couple of hours today look set to shape the remainder of the series. It’s going to be gripping."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bd0e6796f26026553661ac597942dcb826fcf97/0_19_3348_2010/master/3348.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7ae2b65fd99c9c97a501af874f46e99","title":"innocence lost what did you do before the internet","story":"People born in the late 1970s are the last to have grown up without the internet. Social scientists call them the Last of the Innocents. Leah McLaren ponders a time when our attention was allowed to wanderIn moments of digital anxiety I find myself thinking of my father’s desk. Dad was a travelling furniture salesman in the 1980s, a job that served him well in the years before globalisation hobbled the Canadian manufacturing sector. He was out on the road a lot, but when he worked from home he sat in his office, a small windowless study dominated by a large teak desk. There wasn’t much on it – synthetic upholstery swatches, a mug of pens, a lamp, a phone, an ashtray. And yet every day Dad spent hours there, making notes, smoking Craven “A”s, drinking coffee and yakking affably to small-town retailers about shipments of sectional sofas and dinette sets. This is what I find so amazing. That my father – like most other professionals of his generation and generations before him – was able to earn a salary and support our family with little more than a phone and a stack of papers. Just thinking of his desk, the emptiness of it, induces in me a strange disorientation and loneliness. How did he sit there all day, I wonder, without the internet to keep him company?In this age of uncertainty, predictions have lost value, but here’s an irrefutable one: quite soon, no person on earth will remember what the world was like before the internet. There will be records, of course (stored in the intangibly limitless archive of the cloud), but the actual lived experience of what it was like to think and feel and be human before the emergence of big data will be gone. When that happens, what will be lost?Earlier this year I travelled to Wilmslow, a suburb of greater Manchester, to interview Elizabeth Denham, the UK’s Information Commissioner and arguably the most empowered data regulator on the planet. Our discussion was wide-ranging, but among the ICO’s projects she was most enthusiastic about was the Age Appropriate Design Code, or Kids’ Code for short, currently in public consultation. An extrapolation of last year’s Data Protection Act, the new code was devised over several months by a tech child welfare dream team composed of the filmmaker Baroness Beeban Kidron, children’s commissioner Anne Longfield and then minister for digital and creative industries Margot James.The code, which is expected to be laid before parliament this autumn, would completely revolutionise the digital landscape for British children. Among its standards are strict content and design limitations on apps, games and platforms that target minors.Widely used technologies that nudge or manipulate children through algorithms or intermittent reward systems designed to get and keep their attention would be scrutinised and banned. Instead, the onus would be on tech companies to prove “the best interests of a child as the primary consideration” in any product or platform targeted at the youth market.When I mentioned to Denham that I grew up entirely without the internet – having sent my first email on the first day of first year university in 1994 – her eyes brightened. “Ah ha!” she said. “So you’re one of the Last of the Innocents.”What she meant by this is that my population cohort – roughly speaking those born in the mid-to-late 1970s – are the last generation of humans on the planet to have grown up prior to the popularisation of digital culture. Another name for us, coined by the Vancouver writer Michael Harris in his book The End of Absence, is “digital immigrants,” which he defines as those who have lived both “with and without the crowded connectivity of online life.”Denham’s Kids’ Code is an audacious act – a radical new set of rules that would reimagine the internet as a garden of creativity and knowledge for children, rather than the chaotic circus of unregulated content and dubious corporate interests that characterise its current state. The optimism and daring ambition of her project suggests a question I didn’t think to ask until I was already on the train back from Wilmslow: is it possible to regain innocence lost?For weeks after meeting Denham, I found myself haunted by the notion of digital immigration and what it means for my generation. I’d always assumed that not being connected as a child had been a handicap – surely it explained why I’m hopeless at figuring out the smart TV remote or programming the digital thermostat. Like most kids I spent idle summer days drifting around our garden spying faces in the clouds, but my childhood (like most kids in the 80s) was also awash in cultural drek. I had way more weekly screen time than my own kids, most of it spent zoning out on bad sitcom reruns and mind-numbing hours playing Pac-Man on our Commodore 64 so our mum – a housewife with no domestic help – could get the next meal on the table. Surely bingeing on the brilliance of Pixar films and the architectural complexities of Minecraft today is a superior way for a child to spend a rainy afternoon?I began to investigate what it was that marked my generation out – what was the “innocence” lost, if any? I was surprised then to discover many of the neuroscientists, cyber-psychologists and tech ethicists who spend their lives pondering the cultural and moral ramifications of the digital revolution have come to believe that there is something special in my generation, and the recollection of our shared analogue past.It’s not that digital immigrants are smarter or more talented than the digital natives that came after us. Our uniqueness, it seems, lies in the fact that we are the last of a dying breed and as such, living, breathing receptacles of a soon-to-be lost plane of human experience: empty yawning hours and days of nothing much at all.“Which would you rather be, extremely poor with loads of friends or super rich with no friends at all?” This hypothetical question was put to me recently out of nowhere by my 11-year-old stepson. For me the answer was easy. “Poor with friends,” I said. “In the long run, loneliness would be worse than poverty.”My stepson disagreed. “Defo rich with no friends. I’d just stay in my mansion and play Fortnite and watch YouTube and hang out with people online.”He’s a popular kid and part of a close-knit group of boys who’ve been friends since starting school. When offered a choice of whether they’d like to watch a movie together or spend two hours playing Fortnite and interfacing remotely on headsets, the lads didn’t miss a beat in choosing the latter. This is because, for digital natives like my stepson and his mates, socialising online is the same as – at times even preferable to – socialising in person.For his 11th birthday he got his first smart phone and it was as if we’d handed him the keys to a magic portal to an idealised parallel universe. I suppose in a way we had. Just as puberty begins to set in, we’d given him a comfort innocents like me and my husband had never known as alienated adolescents: the feeling of being with friends all the time. The absence of aloneness.For years, scientific debate has raged over whether or not sustained internet use has a deleterious effect on human brain function – particularly on the developing brains of children. The never-ending “screentime debate” has, historically, been heavy on conjecture and light on hard data. But this spring the results of a sweeping international study were published in World Psychiatry, a respected international journal, which may have tipped the balance in favour of digital sceptics. An international team of researchers working with large sample groups in two separate methodologies (MRI brain imaging and behavioural observation), consistently found compelling evidence that prolonged internet use produces both “acute and sustained alterations in specific areas of cognition,” which may reflect long-term changes in the brain, affecting attention , memory and social interactions.Dr Joseph Firth, the Manchester-born neuroscientist who led the study told me that while the human brain does seem to interpret online socialising and connection in much the same way as the in-person variety (great news for friendless super-rich shut-ins), other cognitive functions are shown to be weakened. For instance, he said, the brain adapts fairly quickly to treating the internet as a kind of outsourced memory bank, which results over time in the reduction of our own “transactive memory function,” ie the mental sorting processes the brain performs in order to locate and grasp a fact or mental image.“The problem with the internet,” Firth explained, “is that our brains seem to quickly figure out it’s there – and outsource.” This would be fine if we could rely on the internet for information the same way we rely on, say, the British Library. But what happens when we subconsciously outsource a complex cognitive function to an unreliable online world manipulated by capitalist interests and agents of distortion? “What happens to children born in a world where transactive memory is no longer as widely exercised as a cognitive function?” he asked.James Williams, a former Google strategist-turned Oxford-trained philosopher and digital ethicist is convinced the loss of solitude we are now experiencing is more than just an end of innocence. His book, Stand Out of our Light, outlines the moral danger of the current “attention economy” in which capitalist interests vie constantly to distract us for their own enrichment. Williams told me that unless we find better ways to regulate and interact with the pernicious distractions of big tech, we risk compromising our personal and collective goals and values, even imperilling our own free will.“If what we attend to is, in a very real sense, what we are, then what’s at stake in the battle for our attention is nothing less than our ability to determine and pursue the kinds of lives we want to live, both inidually and societally,” he said. As someone who, like me, grew up in a world without the internet, Williams worries that we will continue to “conflate entertainment with leisure, resulting in fewer and fewer opportunities for reflection and introspection.”By resigning ourselves to the frenetic distractions of the attention economy, digital natives like my children and yours risk losing touch with the experience of what it is to be truly alone with their thoughts. Yes, their entertainment is more sophisticated than what we grew up with (what sane person would trade the bounty of Netflix for terrestrial Friends reruns?), but it’s those empty, restless, vaguely melancholic hours, spent staring at clouds and lounging in trees, they’ll miss. Not that they’ll long for what they don’t know. But we will, the innocents, aka the ones who recall the emptiness and boredom. For it’s in those lost hours that we unwittingly got to know ourselves our imaginations, unbridled, were free to play and laze and wander. And while it was dull and uneventful at times it’s also true that all of humanity’s wonders – including the internet itself – have arisen from this one simple source: a person, a thought, a daydream.It’s precisely this “loss of lack” Vancouver Michael Harris explores in The End of Absence. His experiments with regaining solitude remind me of my father’s desk: go for a long walk without your phone, he recommends. Spend an afternoon writing in longhand. Read 150 pages in one sitting. Simple in theory, but strangely terrifying in practice.Like Williams, Harris told me he doesn’t consider himself anti-technology so much as a critical observer of its effects. He points out that all human inventions, even those we consider banal or beneficial, such as cars or books, hijack our brains and disrupt our consciousness. What we risk losing to the emergence of big data is the richness of our interior lives.“The experience of empty space allows for the growth of imagination and independent thought, the ability to form ideas without being swayed by mass opinion or bot armies,” he said. Moreover, virtual connection impedes our ability to connect and empathise. “When you are inundated with mediated social connectivity it’s increasingly difficult to devote your attention to the people you are actually with.”More than anything, Harris worries that in future only the privileged few will be able to afford to take regular “digital detoxes” from the exhausting demands of the attention economy. As we talk, I think of my seven-year-old who, for the first time this summer, will fly with me to Ottawa then take a six-hour bus to the wilds of Northern Ontario where he will spend seven nights sleeping in a tent, canoeing and eating freeze-dried food cooked over a camp fire with 30 other kids. He won’t have electricity and plumbing, let alone the internet. I won’t disclose the fees except to say it isn’t cheap to abandon a kid in the woods these days.The ICO’s Age Appropriate Design Code will be laid before parliament this autumn. If properly implemented and enforced, it may well make the internet a much safer, secure place for generations of British children to come. While it will, in theory, mean a vast improvement, even Denham’s reimagined internet won’t entirely reclaim our pre-digital innocence. No amount of legislating can give us back the absence of before. Which isn’t to say innocence, or some version of it, can’t be regained, through careful daily practice. Like the act of disconnecting our kids and sending them out to play in the garden. Or of sitting, just for an hour, at my father’s empty desk.Key developments that changed the way we communicate. By Hayley Myers1971: Email Ray Tomlinson was responsible for electronic mail as we know it, choosing the @ sign to connect the username with its destination. Today, it’s estimated there are 3.9 billion email users.1992: Phone texting British engineer Neil Papworth sent the first SMS – ‘Merry Christmas’ – from his computer to the mobile phone of Vodafone’s Richard Jarvis. Handsets didn’t include keyboards then, so Jarvis was unable to reply.1997: Chat rooms Talking to friends (and strangers) in chat rooms dominated the late 1990s. The rise of other internet technologies saw their popularity plummet in the following decade, taking the ubiquitous asl abbreviation with it.2004: Social media Whether a place of meaningful connection, a worrying echo chamber or both, Myspace and its successors created an era where likes, influencers and filters reign supreme – despite recent concerns over privacy and data breaches.2005: YouTube YouTube’s first ever video, ‘Me At The Zoo’, was uploaded by the channel’s founder Jawed Karim. It’s since been viewed 73m times, paving the way for cultural moments, such as ‘Charlie Bit My Finger’, skateboarding bulldogs and Justin Bieber."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a15f4284f3a7cea4b823b2267be1820fb4648b39/1181_1041_3639_2184/master/3639.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e282be98d954c046b234a79e2ded070","title":"deafness its part of who you are one mans journey to inspire","story":"Ed Rex has enjoyed some memorable travel experiences over the years. He tells  Lucy Jolin about how he started his travel blogging business and the tech that helps himTravel blogger Ed Rex has had plenty of memorable moments in his career to date, from snorkelling in Fiji to marvelling at the Iguazu Falls on the border of Brazil and Argentina. But one of the most memorable was when he accidentally signed up for a job at a nudist resort in Australia.“The plan was to work at resorts in return for bed and breakfast,” he says with a grin. “The resort sent me a nice email saying they were looking forward to me coming and would pick me up – and by the way, we’re nudists: is that OK with you? And I had to be nude as well. That was a challenge! I’ve certainly never done naked gardening in the UK ...”Rex was born deaf, but he’s never let that stand in the way of his determination to experience life to the full. He studied environmental biology and science at the University of Leeds and worked in the sector for several years before jacking in his job to see the world.“I’d always had a love of travel but I didn’t have anyone to travel with, and I didn’t have the confidence to travel on my own,” he says. “Then, just before I left my last job, I had an operation to insert a cochlear implant into my right ear, as the hearing in that ear had gone completely. I was struggling to be involved in social situations, and feeling pretty down.”While the operation isn’t the preferred choice for all, for Rex it made a huge difference. “I was a completely different person,” he says. “Suddenly, I had so much confidence. So off I went, around the world. That was the start of the travel blogging, too. I realised I had a love of storytelling.”Rex charts all his travels on his blog, rexyedventures (strapline: “Adventures of a handsome backpacker travelling the unexpected”), which quickly caught the attention of major brands, including KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, MyDestination and Hotel.info. These days he’s a well-known figure on the travel blogger scene. He’s often asked to go on trips and to review accommodation and experiences – recent adventures include quad biking in Australia and two weeks in South Africa. And he’s written widely about his experiences as a deaf traveller too, on rexyedventures and his Deaf Traveller blog.There have been challenges, of course, as well as some some odd attitudes. “I remember one Australian guy saying: ‘Can I catch deafness from you?’ which was bizarre! I took out my hearing aid, which I use for my left ear, and said: ‘Quick, quick, the germs are on the loose!’ But most of the time, it’s fine. Sometimes people have questions but they are afraid to ask, so you have to start the conversation yourself. For me, deafness is not a taboo subject and you can make fun of yourself. It’s part of who you are.”But odd attitudes like the earlier one are rare, he points out. “Most of the time it’s just about looking after yourself and making sure you’re not in a situation where you could be vulnerable. I’ve always felt quite safe. And if something happens – like being dropped off by a bus in Thailand in the middle of nowhere – it’s fine if you don’t lose your cool and get stressed.”Rex is a keen user and advocate of better accessibility tech – he’s passionate about the need to get British transport right, particularly train companies that still use tannoys to make announcements. He’s pleased that Microsoft’s most recent software is taking steps in the right direction.“I particularly like the visual notification feature, which sets the screen to flash, rather than making a sound, and the accessibility checker on Word, Excel and Powerpoint,” he says. “Subtitling is great: it’s a massive thing to be able to turn on subtitles in Powerpoint,” he says, adding that it gets better every time you use it.“You can get subtitles for every video on the web, too. And I’ve used Skype for yonks, but I never realised before that you can turn on subtitles for every single Skype call, and you can download the transcript at the end of it. That’s so good for business meetings.”In the future, Rex is looking forward to more trips and continuing to use his platform to inspire others and break down stereotypes, particularly among young people.“Deafness is associated with people who are old! But there are so many deaf kids who don’t have any role models. And there’s a wide spectrum of deafness, too: people who use sign language, people who have mild hearing loss and so on. I want to say: you can do this. If I can do it, you can do it. It’s all about standing up and believing in yourself,” he says.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

What is it about malts, bourbons and blends that inspires such dedication?Few drinks inspire the way whisky does. Proud Scottish writer and raconteur Compton Mackenzie declared: “Love makes the world go round? Not at all. Whisky makes it go round twice as fast.” And Irish playwright and activist George Bernard Shaw romantically described whisky as “liquid sunshine”.While it’s easy to conjure the image of the spirit being swilled by middle-aged men wearing tweed the truth is that whisky’s appeal knows no boundaries. It’s been the go-to drink of celebrities (as well as politicians) for decades. Everyone from Kate Moss - who once threw a Burns Night party in a hotel that stocks 1,000 bottles - to Hollywood royalty such as Humphrey Bogart and Ava Gardner, to Margaret Thatcher, have been keen fans … and they know it’s much more than just a drink. Tobermory whisky holds true to that philosophy. Born and distilled on the Isle of Mull, it’s a homage to the rich palate of its Hebridean home, where creativity and nature exist side by side.Tobermory’s spirit is rich with character and culture, like some of history’s most expressive whisky-lovers. Here’s what they have to say about one of life’s finest pleasures.Ol’ Blue Eyes Frank Sinatra enjoyed a whisky on stage during his shows - so much so he was even buried with a bottle in 1998. He famously said: “Alcohol may be man’s worst enemy, but the bible says love your enemy.”It’s no wonder his second wife, Ava Gardner, loved it too. She once said: “I wish to live to 150 years old, but the day I die, I wish it to be with a cigarette in one hand and a glass of whiskey in the other.”According to some – although this is much contested – Humphrey Bogart’s last words were: “I should never have switched from scotch to martinis.”Winston Churchill drank a whisky and soda every day at 11am. During the war in India, he said: “The water was not fit to drink. To make it palatable, we had to add whisky. By diligent effort, I learned to like it.”Margaret Thatcher also enjoyed whisky and soda, believing it gave her strength. “You must have whisky to give you energy,” she said.Carry On legend Sid James kept bottles to hand on set, after quickly learning he got sent freebies if he could sneak them into shot. Shortly after James’s death, Les Dawson was in the dressing room of the theatre where James had collapsed when he saw a ghostly apparition – and the room began to smell of whisky.Fancying a lifestyle change, their pal Tommy Cooper once joked: “I’m on a whisky diet. I’ve lost three days already.”Mark Twain, author of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, was also in the “less is more” camp – until it came to the spirit. “Too much of anything is bad,” he declared, “but too much good whiskey is barely enough.”To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ceb83bc821f5da0f2b51a631f919ddb75af429cb/0_155_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0aebce595e6475f7cf9ddf11f83e9fd","title":"greek islands kalymnos rock climbing diving","story":"Kalymnos, second hop on our tour of lesser-known islands, has many rock-climbing highlights – and some sweet spots for scuba ing• Read part 1 of Kevin’s odyssey: IkariaI’m sitting on the shady patio of the Paradisio cafe in Vlychadia, overlooking an azure bay. My wet swimming kit is drying on the fence. “I should explain the breakfast,” says Stethis, who has been my guide on an epic morning of hiking, caving and swimming. “Kalymnos people like to mix unexpected tastes. That tea is alisfakia – sage – with thyme honey. And that mizithra cheese goes with the watermelon.”“And the coffee is bitter, but you’ve got this vanilla-scented sugar stick.”I’m starting to get the hang of Kalymnos, the second stop on my quest to explore the Aegean’s lesser-known islands (which had begun in Ikaria, 2hr 40min away by ferry). This is an island that seems to love both the unexpected and the extreme.Kalymnos was once the sponge-ing capital of the Mediterranean, but by the mid-1980s, a marine virus had destroyed that business. (The interesting nautical museum in the capital, Pothia, is filled with superb period photographs and artefacts.) Meanwhile, the nearby island of Kos had become a tourist honeypot, whose boat owners reportedly told visitors not to bother with Kalymnos because “it’s just rocks”.That didn’t deter Andrea Di Bari, an Italian climber who wanted rocks, big ones. He came over in the mid-1990s on a day trip, spotted the potential, and returned. By the early noughties, rock climbing had transformed the island’s reputation. I’ve come to test out this island of adventure.I’m joined by my partner Sophie and daughter Maddy (16) who have come over on the ferry from Kos for a few days. We stay in the climbing capital, Massouri, in a cool and lovely apartment overlooking Telendos, a car-free island that I’m itching to explore. But we start by meeting Dimitris, a e master who sails us east around the island. Dimitris comes from a long line of sponge ers, and points out the spot where, 50 years ago, his grandfather died while using a newfangled brass helmet and compressor. No one had told the ers about the dangers and complexities of using air underwater.Today we are searching for dolphins and Dimitris assures us that his family connections will guarantee an encounter. Stopping above his father-in-law’s fish farm, he es to 20 metres and releases a shoal of sea bass. I’m snorkelling above and see them come up, rolling their silvery sides enticingly, but there are no dolphins. The sea bass, sensing an opportunity, race away to freedom. Yesterday’s stormy winds, Dimitris thinks, have unfortunately pushed the dolphins out of their usual haunts.We climb back into the boat and head into a narrow inlet where cliffs up to 15 metres high have become a popular spot for deep-water soloing. This involves ing into the sea, then grabbing the rock and attempting to climb to the cliff-top. A pair of old climbing shoes can be handy. Maddy skips the climbing element, walks up and chucks herself off the top. I fall. Deep water soloing is, I predict, a sport of the future, especially when the water is this warm.We sail on round the east coast to the lovely village of Vathys, where we say goodbye to Dimitris and jump into kayaks with a new guide, Tasos. He paddles with us to another, much higher, cliff face and points out a cave about 50 metres up. After an ungainly transfer to land, we climb a narrow set of steps, push through a curtain of wild figs and descend into cool gloom. All sorts of ancient treasures have been found in this cave (they’re now in the remarkable Archaeological Museum of Kalymnos, also in Pothia). At the bottom is a pool of clear, cold water. Potsherds (broken ceramics) lie around the feet of great limestone pillars.We retrace our steps and paddle out to a lovely deserted beach to picnic in the shade of a tree. Day one complete, we return to Massouri, where there are lots of excellent restaurants.Next morning Maddy and I are back with Dimitris for a shore e which proves to be something of a classic: sponges, amphorae, a German second world war plane, bombs, a wrecked sponge boat, plenty of fish and an irate octopus that squirts angry ink, changes colour and escapes up a tiny rocky hole.Finally, the bit I’ve been most looking forward to: the rock climbing. We are picked up by Loukas and Kostas. Is it going to be too hot? Loukas shakes his head. “We have climbing in the shade all year. May and October are best, but summer is fine.”There are also so many routes that climbers can do 10 a day for a year and never repeat one. We head north to cliffs above the village of Arginonta. Kostas, Maddy and I climb. Sophie watches. There’s a dog barking down in the village.“That’s Vito, my dog,” says Kostas. He points out his house. “He wants to play.”Sophie heads off to find Vito. I manage to climb a grade harder than I’ve ever done before and then we head for the beach. That’s the joy of Kalymnos: hard, dry rock followed by cool wet sea. There we find Sophie in doggie heaven. Vito likes ing down, picking things off the seabed and bringing them back to be thrown. Climbing may be the new Kalymnos, but the sponge-ing heritage is still there.• The trip was provided by Sunvil which has seven nights self-catering at Eftychia Residence in Massouri from £1,253pp including flights from Gatwick and transfers.

Here, she talks about her father’s death, social activism and not always trusting her own headThe day before I meet Aisling Bea at her home in London, she gets in touch to ask my biscuit preferences and I reply, with a journalistic sigh, knowing this is destined to be a puff piece. Except, when I arrive, she serves me tea with a milk chocolate digestive (not on my list, obviously) because, “Princess,” my list was ridiculous, and I will get what I’m given. The disappointment is a relief, because it releases me from the shackles of love and allows the scathing hatchet job to follow. Buckle up!Though This Way Up, the tender, funny sitcom Bea has written and stars in is yet to air, you will already recognise her from the telly. As a regular panellist on game shows and a standup on Live at the Apollo, and an actor in dramas including The Fall, she has been elegantly circling fame since she moved to London from Kildare, and enrolled in drama school. It was the kind of drama school where they learned “historical dance”, and had to spend an hour pretending to be mud – it turned out to be great training for a comedian.After a role in Sharon Horgan’s sitcom Dead Boss she tried standup, and in 2013 was nominated for best newcomer at Edinburgh, with stories about her family, Ireland, feminism and death. If she got bad reviews, she’d remember her mother Helen’s advice. Helen had been a jockey in Kildare who told her that when she won everyone would compliment the horse, but if she lost, they’d say it was her fault.Bea was raised by women, eight aunts, one nun – her father died when she was three. Ten years later her mother told her he’d taken his own life. She had waited for two reasons: the first, she didn’t think her daughters were ready to hear the truth, and the second, suicide was only decriminalised two years after her husband’s death. There was a time in Irish history when if you attempted suicide, you were punished by hanging. Bea suddenly hated him. She vowed never to talk about him again. So it wasn’t until 2017, aged 33, her career bubbling to life, that many of her friends learned the details of his death.She wrote about it for the , partly because she wanted, “to put a beginning, middle and end on my experience,” partly because she didn’t want it thrown at her in an interview later and partly to reach out to people who were suffering. She was not prepared for the reaction, but we’ll come to that.“Eat your biscuit,” she says, firmly. We are drinking green tea in her living room, where a piano and trophy shelf compete for space, and through the glass doors her “lady garden” is alive with bees and jasmine. She has been working too much, she feels a little mad. After writing, then filming six episodes of her show, she moved to Rome to shoot a romantic comedy, but worked on edits in the evenings – this is a rare afternoon, when she can sit on her own sofa, under no pressure to make strangers laugh.In This Way Up, Bea (who took that stage name in memory of her dad, Brian) plays Aine, a foreign-language school worker who’s recovering from a “teeny little nervous breakdown”, with her sister, played by Horgan. “When I started writing the characters, I’d think, what’s their loneliness? Is it being the only person in an environment that does a certain job, or is it the relationship they’re not happy in? Is it being an immigrant?” Loneliness is something she thinks about a lot.“I don’t think it has anything to do with being alone. I’ve never really been alone. I have an amazing family, amazing friends, I’ve been in amazing relationships…” In recent years, she has been snapped on red carpets with boyfriends including Michael Sheen and Andrew Garfield. “But loneliness,” she says, “for me comes from being your own worst enemy. In not being able to trust your head sometimes, and what it’s going to do next. That’s a wound and a gift.”She’s not afraid of an audience booing. “I’m afraid of myself. What if I am not on my side that day?” That’s why she has a pint before a performance. “It’s not for confidence, it’s to stop getting in your own way. To forget you’re on stage before the other you realises you’re there. To me, that is a really lonely feeling. Because it’s just you and yourself in that little battle.” Peppered throughout our conversation are references to books about the brain and the body, which perform, in 2019, as self-help guides for people, like Bea, who are constantly striving and constantly questioning. “The biggest constant in terms of my friends is to do with the plastic-ness of their brains – who’s working on themselves and who will admit that they’re idiots sometimes? We’re all having these mini-breakdowns, some realisations and then some expansions.”One such expansion has been her increased activism. Bea was a supporter of the change to Ireland’s abortion laws: she and Horgan dressed in Handmaid’s Tale bonnets urging people to vote, and wrote a comic essay published in a collection titled Repeal the 8th, which explains the mystery of women. One of Bea’s gifts is to slide politics in when you’re not watching, like vegetables, chopped up very small. Her standup is broad and jolly, with outbreaks of jokes about women’s safety. Her Instagram looks glamorous, but includes credits for ethical fashion and charity-shop tips. She is a regular on the Guilty Feminist podcast. And, while it looks as though she’s gamely chuckling on panel shows, she is also taking notes.“There are only a few regulars who are female. And still, no one has ever come to us and asked our advice on how to make them easier for women. Which I find interesting, not being asked: ‘What makes this space dangerous for you?’ It’s the little moments.” The time spent in the makeup chair, or if there’s another woman onstage and if so, where she’s sitting, and how many women were in the writers room, and panellists not interrupting those who speak softly.“It’s another comedian allowing you to make the punchline, not assuming you’re setting up a joke for them. But it’s like, if someone doesn’t think you’re fit enough to be on the pitch and you’re going for the goal. They run on and go, ‘Don’t worry, I’ve got one for the team.’ But you knew you could score. It’s not just about visibility. Diversity is being invited to the party, and inclusion is feeling you belong.”She talks very fast and with great precision, about her belief in quotas, in listening, in admitting when we get things wrong, and then she stops, slumping slightly. “But, nobody wants to walk around being angry any more. I don’t want to have to talk about this. I’m bored talking about it. This is probably the least funny I can be, talking about gender and comedy. I can’t be as joyful. It gets in the way. It’s exhausting. And it doesn’t allow me to do the thing I’m supposed to be doing. You just want to go into your game, you don’t want to worry about walking home.”She sips her tea. “There are two schools of thought. One is survival of the fittest: if you’re good enough, you will get there. But, you are being good enough within someone else’s realm. And the fact of the matter is, if you create a shouty environment that’s all about competitiveness, you are rooting out a different type of person. So on panel shows people who aren’t as loud don’t get to speak.” In March, she stood down as a team captain on 8 Out of 10 Cats.When Bea was 10 and she learned the truth about her dad, her story was set. “The narrative was, I’m not supposed to talk about this.” It continued throughout her life. “If I do, people will know I’m sad and they won’t find me funny any more. I’ll be the person known for that thing. And I’ll upset my family. And I am the way I am because there’s no men in my family. And I have got to where I am in spite of childhood tragedy. But actually, none of that is true.”There were many myths, she realised recently. One was the idea that, not only had her father abandoned them, but, as he didn’t name Bea in his suicide note, he had forgotten her. Then, 20 years later, a parcel arrived. A box of his things, including the photos he had been looking at when he died – they were nearly all of her. In her  article she wrote a letter to him, which ended: “I am your daughter and I am really fucking funny, just like you. But, unlike you, I’m going to stop being it for five minutes and write our story in the hope it may help someone who didn’t get to have a box turn up, or who may not feel ‘in their right mind’ right now and needs a reminder to find hope.” When the piece came out, it felt like she had finally buried him.Then the letters started coming – from people who had felt suicidal and from people whose loved ones had killed themselves, and from her dad’s friends, who had disappeared after his death.“I went over to meet them, to help them talk about their mental-health issues. And I’ve still got a comedy career, I think. And I don’t think people find me any less funny because of it. And I realise, I’m so bolstered and helped by the men in my life. All the messages, on so many platforms, can be a bit of a punch to the tummy sometimes. But the variety of types of people who write in, like I’m a radio show, absolutely built up my empathy muscle. And it’s allowed me to stop thinking I was the only one with that story…” She is trying very quietly not to cry. “Oh, I hate getting all upset. And this is why I wrote the article because I just get wobbly talking about it. Right…” She takes a dramatic breath. “The true narrative is there are a million different stories, and maybe the one you think is real is not the real story.”Once, she went to see a psychic and was upset when the woman couldn’t get in touch with her dad. “I’m like,” she snickers, ‘Are you even a real psychic?’ But the psychic replied, ‘Maybe it’s just that your dad’s death doesn’t define you.’ “What if,” Bea thought, then, “I was able to let that go?” Would she still be able to write? She pauses. “These are all realisations I’m having now I’m in my ‘white lady expanding’ stage.” She offers me another bad biscuit, which I eat.There is a Whatsapp group that consists of, among others, Lena Dunham, Richard Curtis, and Aisling Bea, where the sole topic of conversation is Love Island. “IT IS A COMPLICATED THING AS A FEMINIST AND PERSON WITH A BRAIN AND I KNOW IT IS TRICKERY, BUT IT IS ALSO ANTHROPOLOGY AND TALES AS OLD AS TIME,” she emails me later, caps lock on.Telly is important to her, in part because of what it reveals about what we need. “I’m not surprised shows like Queer Eye and Marie Kondo are capturing people,” she says, tucking her feet up on to the sofa, “because it’s about communal ideas of help, as well as getting rid of your old shoes. Money isn’t going to fill us up so what’s the thing? Each other. And that sounds cutesy-cutesy, but we can feel it on a big level at the moment. If we’re relying on fucking Boris Johnson to fix things for us, that won’t happen in our lifetime. And it’s awful. It’s fucking awful that Help Refugees has to go over to Calais with a lot of fucking comedians. That people have to take it upon themselves to leave food outside Waitrose to help their fellow man because the government isn’t doing anything about it. But the cavalry are not coming.”When she left drama school (after an earlier degree in French and philosophy) she expected to be playing Medea within a week. “But as Sharon Horgan always says, waiting around for great female parts doesn’t work. So you have to write them. This idea of the giant parental system looking after us just isn’t happening. So in the interim, we’ve got to step up.” I must have narrowed my eyes, preparing to unleash a gob of cynicism, because she leans in: “Demanding more at a small level means that the bigger people start realising there’s a business in that. And we send the message back up the supply chain. Yeah, petitions don’t work when it’s seven of us. But they might work when there are 200,000 of us. That little girl did that.” She’s talking about Greta Thunberg, of course. “With Repeal there were sweatshirts, with Greta Thunberg there were pigtails!”With Bea, it’s humour. Apart from the earlier biscuit terrorism, it is very difficult to find a single crack to poke criticism into. I continue to try, because journalism. The appeal of Bea and, with This Way Up, the thing that will no doubt propel her from Dave stalwart to artist (much in the way Catastrophe took Horgan’s subversive voice mainstream) is the way she combines her jollity with that forensic exploration of melancholy. The idea of her “narrative” is one she continues to dissect, and question. “I definitely used to think happiness was like, every night being a night in a nightclub. Every meal is going to be delicious. Every time you have sex, it’s going to be great. No – sometimes it’s just grand. Not living in a mansion but…” she gestures around her home, “living in a house where someone can stay over, if they need to. The aim now is to get to that state of ‘grand’.”I have drunk a lot of tea, but I leave the recorder running when I go to the bathroom. Transcribing the next day I am treated to a message hidden beneath the interview.“Just while you’re in the loo,” she whispers, “I do think petitions work. They’re part of a million-pronged approach, of course. And also I think this interview’s gone really well. And I think you’re great. And remind me to talk to you about a retinol that doesn’t dry out your skin. OK, all the best. From Aisling.” That cow.This Way Up will air on Channel 4 at 10pm on 8 August.In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/289078389323f7169589a7aa9ff575f3e94dd4fb/0_17_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f523e12381008b9724bedf2469c5c40","title":"joe biden democrats marathon ","story":"The former vice-president’s lead in the polls has proven durable, but some fear a replay of 2016A small cheer went up as Joe Biden walked into the Detroit One Coney Island Restaurant, took off his sunglasses and beamed. The candidate shook hands and talked with diners for more than an hour while camera phones snapped.The frontrunner for the Democratic nomination for US president in 2020 emerged from the restaurant to be greeted by cameras, reporters, onlookers and a young woman blowing a trumpet, accompanied by a man playing a cello.“This is a marathon,” an upbeat Biden said. “We’ve passed the quarter mark and I’m feeling good.”It was Thursday and the former vice-president had just emerged from the second Democratic primary debate bloodied but unbowed. His rivals had attempted to gang up on him like the assassins of Julius Caesar, twisting their knives on civil rights, the climate crisis, criminal justice, healthcare, immigration and women’s rights.After it was over, no one claimed that Biden had destroyed his foes or offered Obama-like inspiration the late-night TV comedian Stephen Colbert observed, “Democrats have gone from ‘Yes, we can!’ to ‘That’ll do’.”But Biden had survived. Supporters took solace in his resilience, which is starting to look like a habit that could yet secure him the right to go up against Donald Trump in a fight for the White House. Already in this campaign, Biden has been confronted by women’s claims that he inappropriately touched them, been forced into a U-turn on government funding for abortions, faced allegations that he plagiarised sections of his climate crisis plan, earned opprobrium for his reminiscing about working with racial segregationists in the US Senate and been ambushed on his race record by Senator Kamala Harris in the first primary debate.Yet, instead of collapsing, Biden retains a healthy lead in the opinion polls before next year’s caucuses and primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and other states that will determine which Democrat goes head to head with Donald Trump in November 2020.Two people whom Biden encountered at his campaign stop in Detroit on Thursday illustrated why, in his third bid for the White House, he is still the man to beat – but also the many pitfalls that lie ahead.A key segment of his support is older voters, notably including African Americans. The Rev Wendell Anthony, president of the Detroit branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), explained why.“Because we know him,” said Anthony, 69. “And because he was with the first African American president and they have a record on healthcare, working with the community. He helped the city of Detroit in terms of the bussing, transportation, housing … When you put his record up against some of the others, it stands a measure above and I just think that it’s not what you’re going to do, it’s what you’ve already done. He’s done enough to merit the kind of support that he’s getting.”However, after Biden had embraced Anthony and climbed into his black limousine following the event, a woman rushed towards it shouting at him through the tinted window: “Three million deportations! Three million deportations! We don’t need your big answers. We need better candidates! Where is your apology?”The incident highlighted how, by tethering himself to Obama as he promises to heal the nation’s soul, Biden has brought the 44th president’s own record under fresh scrutiny, as was evident at the debates. The Obama administration deported more than 3 million undocumented immigrants, far more than his predecessors George W Bush and Bill Clinton. Attitudes in the Democratic party have shifted since then – and threaten to leave Biden behind.The anti-Biden protester was Brenda Valladares, 29, of Movimiento Cosecha, an immigrant-led movement campaigning for protection and respect. She said: “There are 3 million deportations that are on his hands that he was complicit with. I’m just reminding him because there’s still no answer. There’s still no apology for the atrocities that the undocumented communities experienced for eight years and that built and lay the groundwork for the atrocities and the hate that we’re experiencing today.”Detecting such vulnerabilities, some of Biden’s competitors have offered bold ideas to fix the broken immigration system. Similarly, some have gone much further than Obama’s signature legislative achievement, the Affordable Care Act, with proposals for healthcare reform such as Medicare for All.But others in the party fear this plays into Trump’s hands, fueling his argument that Democrats have become “radical socialists”, personified by the congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her allies in “the Squad”. To this constituency, Biden seems like a safer choice.In part this case rests on the notion that 2020 is no ordinary election. The Republican standard bearer is not a mainstream political figure such as John McCain or Mitt Romney but a celebrity businessman who has trashed norms, debased discourse and boasted about groping women. Therefore, the argument goes, this is not the time to experiment. Beating Trump is everything.Biden points to polls showing that he is well placed to win the crucial midwest battleground states that Hillary Clinton lost to Trump, restoring African American turnout to Obama-era levels and flipping blue-collar workers back into the Democratic column.“I can win Michigan,” he said forcefully on Thursday. “They know me, I’ve worked my whole life. I come from the middle class. I understand it. I know what’s going on. I promise you, if I get the nomination, I will win Michigan, I promise you. I will win Pennsylvania. I will win Ohio.”John Zogby, an author and pollster, said: “I always thought Biden is the one to go after Trump. He has the experience not to get bogged down in how low Trump can go. He’s the one who can say, ‘Donald, knock off this shit.’”At 76, Biden would surpass Trump as the oldest person ever elected US president and would be yet another white man chosen from a historically erse field that includes women, people of color and a 37-year-old mayor who is gay.While he dominates the moderates’ lane, his most significant challenge may now come from the left. This week he was spared a direct clash with Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who appeared on night one of the two-part debate. Both are capable of firing up young supporters in a way that Biden might envy.Luntz added: “I think that there’s a feeling within the Democratic party to go to the next generation. Medicare for All undermines Obamacare. The Green New Deal and the guaranteed living wage: that’s not Bill Clinton’s Democratic party and it’s not Barack Obama’s Democratic party.”Many on the left fear that Biden v Trump would be a replay of 2016’s Clinton v Trump with a similar enthusiasm gap. They suggest that Biden’s candidacy is in a slow but inexorable decline. Neil Sroka, spokesman for the progressive group Democracy for America, who is based in Detroit and attended night one of the debate, said: “Joe Biden’s best day in the race was the very first one.“He is the former vice-president of the United States who served with an extremely popular president, so it would be surprising if his candidacy imploded. It’s not a balloon that’s going to pop. It’s leaking air and there are moments when it leaks faster than others. Sometimes it gives the impression that it has stopped leaking altogether.”Sroka, who worked on Obama’s first campaign in South Carolina, suggested that Biden could not take African American voters for granted.“In 2007-08, black voters were Hillary Clinton’s base in that race all the way until Iowa. The most transformative day was Obama’s win in Iowa – suddenly we were inundated. I think it’s very likely Biden wins black voters right until the caucuses actually start happening. Just because someone has a lock on a constituency now doesn’t mean they will throughout,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be876570a61a746bbc8c2d684ee0baef50cd215b/0_0_5463_3278/master/5463.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71ad1cf95083f2711a90f65835ee9da0","title":"activists scramble to prevent uighur mans deportation to china","story":"Ablikim Yusuf, who had been living in Pakistan, faces detention and torture if he is sent to China, say supportersHuman rights activists are scrambling to prevent the imminent deportation of a Uighur man to China, where they say he faces torture.Ablikim Yusuf, 53, who has been living in Pakistan, posted a desperate video on Facebook asking for help from the overseas Uighur community. He says in the video, translated and circulated by activists on Saturday: “I am currently being held in Doha airport, about to be deported to Beijing, China. I need the world’s help. I am originally from Hotan.”After the video was shared widely on social media and the campaign gathered momentum, Ablikim was given leave to stay in Qatar for an additional 24 hours, said his lawyer, Kimberley Motley.However, he still faces the threat of deportation to China on Sunday. “We are desperately trying to convince another government to accept him,” she said.China has come under growing international pressure for its treatment of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in the far western region of Xinjiang, where as many as 1.5 million have been detained in secretive internment and re-education camps.According to activists advocating for Ablikim, he left Xinjiang in 1997 for Pakistan. They said he had left Pakistan on 31 July and was stopped while trying to reach Bosnia. He was brought to Doha International airport, where he was told he would be deported.A representative for Qatar Airways confirmed that Ablikim was booked for a flight departing Doha for Beijing at 11:20am local time on 3 August.“Sending Ablikim back to China would most definitely mean sending him to either concentration camps or prison or worse, his death,” said Salih Hudayar, the founder of the East Turkistan National Awakening Movement, a political and human rights group based in the US.He and other activists were camped outside the Qatari embassy in Washington in the early hours of Saturday morning.“It would also encourage other countries that China is pressing to deport Uighurs, which in turn would encourage China to continue its brutal campaign of persecution. We are shocked that Qatar would even consider this, given it claims to be a defender of Muslim rights,” he said.On Thursday, a senior Xinjiang official said the majority of those kept in the camps, which China describes as voluntary vocational training centres, had been released. Uighurs with relatives still in Xinjiang expressed incredulity and anger.Critics said such statements obscured the fact that ex-detainees had been shifted into forced labour, kept in other forms of police custody, and continued to be heavily surveilled."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29ac2661f5f37e9bbd4ebe4d7773253ec4520fc2/0_5_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e79b6599fd38d57fb72a107020e9e571","title":"thousands of tourists flee kashmir after security alert","story":"India claims it killed five militants trying to attack its forces in disputed region Tens of thousands of tourists, pilgrims and workers have begun leaving the disputed region of Kashmir after local officials issued a security alert and India said it had killed at least five militants who were trying to attack its forces.The Foreign Office on Saturday issued new advice to avoid all travel to Jammu and Kashmir, adding: “There is a risk of unpredictable violence, including bombings, grenade attacks, shootings and kidnapping.”Germany and Australia gave similar warnings to their citizens.Indian security officials ordered people to leave the Kashmir valley after they had found evidence of attacks planned by what they said were Pakistani military-backed militants on a major Hindu pilgrimage, the Amarnath Yatra – which ends in mid-August – in Muslim-majority Kashmir.Officials called off the pilgrimage and asked the pilgrims and tourists to return home, causing panic as visitors scrambled to arrange transport. A separate government notice also advised hundreds of students from other Indian states to leave the Himalayan valley.Anxious visitors, including some foreigners, flooded the airport at the main city Srinagar on Saturday, many without tickets for flights that day.“Passengers who were scheduled to return in coming days have turned up in panic at the airport today,” said the manager of one airline operating the Delhi-Srinagar route. “It’s chaotic and not many will manage seats unless there are additional flights.”Hundreds of Indian students from outside Kashmir were evacuated in buses. “All the non-local students have left the campus for their respective states,” an administrative official at the National Institute of Technology in Srinagar told AFP.Srinagar-based Indian defence spokesman Colonel Rajesh Kalia said there had been a number of attempts by Pakistan-based militants to disturb the peace in the region and target pilgrims. Five to seven militants were killed when they tried to attack Indian troops, Kalia said, adding that arms and ammunition were recovered in the operation.A Pakistani defence spokesperson dismissed India’s assertions as “mere propaganda”, calling them “blatant lies”.A senior local government official in Kashmir said most of the 20,000 Hindu pilgrims and Indian tourists, and the more than 200,000 labourers, were leaving the region.Visitor numbers have been boosted by the Amarnath Yatra pilgrimage in recent years, with more than 300,000 Hindus devotees visiting the ice stalagmite cave shrine in the Himalayas. A huge security force had been guarding the route even before the alert, and a second smaller pilgrimage, the Machail Mata Yatra, in Jammu region was also cancelled on Saturday. Kashmiri residents formed long lines outside petrol stations, food stores and bank cash machines on Friday night after the alert was announced. But the queues eased on Saturday.Kashmir was ided between India and Pakistan when they gained independence in 1947,but both claim it in full. They have fought two of their three wars since over the territory.The Indian government has admitted that 10,000 extra troops were sent to Kashmir – where it already has 500,000 forces stationed – a week ago. Media reports on Friday said a further 25,000 troops had been ordered there. The government has declined to say how many are in the new reinforcements.While military authorities and the state government highlighted the security risk, Kashmir politicians have raised fears that the extra Indian troops are a sign that the Hindu nationalist government could carry out a threat to scrap Kashmir’s special status under the constitution."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f578daf31829c34a60958d6bf220168882ba56de/0_211_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=397ce0e1c3cf8254dbc2dd8a4aec923d","title":"mike pompeo urges australia to stand up for itself over trade with china","story":"US secretary of state dismisses warning by top security analyst, arguing ‘you can sell your soul for a pile of soy beans or you can protect your people’The US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has declared “you can sell your soul for a pile of soy beans, or you can protect your people”, dismissing a warning from prominent Australian security analyst Hugh White that Australia should avoid following Donald Trump into a confrontation with Beijing that America probably can’t win.Pompeo issued the provocative declaration during a question-and-answer session at the Centre for Independent Studies in Sydney on Sunday.The public event hosted by the thinktank followed security talks where Australia’s defence minister Linda Reynolds confirmed the Morrison government is seriously considering a request to join a US-led coalition to protect shipping in the Gulf from Iranian military forces.Trump’s most senior foreign policy adviser contended the catch-up was required because the world had been much too passive as China “began to behave in ways it had not done before”.“The efforts to steal data across networks … or efforts to militarise the South China Sea, something president Xi promised the world he would not do, or engage in activities where they foist money on nations that are desperate for resources and leave them trapped in debt positions which ultimately aren’t about commercial transactions but about political control,” the secretary of state said.Pompeo said there was real opportunity in the deep economic relationship between Washington and Beijing, “but everybody needs to have their eyes wide open, and the United States certainly does”.He noted there was sometimes a rhetorical distinction made between trade and security imperatives, when the issues were actually codependent. “Sometimes I hear folks talk about trade and economic issues as separate from national security,” Pompeo said Sunday.“Let’s make no mistake about it. China’s capacity, the People’s Liberation Army’s capacity to do exactly what they are doing is a direct result of the trade relationships.“They grew their country on the back of a set of unfair trade rules, so they were able to grow their economy at a high rate of speed and to steal technology and to force technology transfers.“Those same economic tools that president Trump is so focused on fixing are what’s enabled China to do all the things they are doing with their military all around the world – it underwrites their capacity to build a military.”It was put to Pompeo that White, a high-profile professor of strategic studies at the Australian National University, had argued Australia’s economic relationship with China was critically important, helping to keep Australia out of recession during the global financial crisis. White had argued Canberra would be unwise to support Washington in a confrontation with China that America probably cannot win.“Look, you can sell your soul for a pile of soy beans or you can protect your people,” Pompeo said in response to the question. “Our mission is to do both. We think it’s possible to achieve both of those outcomes.“We think its possible to have trade with China and yet require them to behave with the same set of rules.“No country, no civilisation, permits this kind of imbalance in rules for an extended period of time and survives. Our effort is to restore that reciprocity.“We welcome China’s continued growth, but its got to be right and its got to be fair and its got to be equitable and reciprocal.”The hawkish comments come in the middle of a renewed round of disputation between Washington and Beijing over trade. Trump has threatened to impose new tariffs on $300bn worth of Chinese goods – an action that spooked financial markets. Australia’s trade minister Simon Birmingham said on Sunday if Trump’s threat came to pass it could breach World Trade Organisation rules.Australia has called repeatedly for the US and China to end the damaging trade dispute which threatens global growth.Earlier in the day, the US defence secretary Mark Esper used his visit to Australia to give China another significant blast. He declared Beijing engaged in “predatory economics” and the promotion of “state-sponsored theft of other nations’ intellectual property”.“In the Indo-Pacific, power should not determine position and that should not determine destiny,” Esper said. “The US will not stand by idly while any one nation attempts to reshape the region to its favour at the expense of others.“We know that our allies and partners would not either.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"One man (32) arrested by PSNI and scene in west Belfast examined by forensic officersFestival aims to encourage \u0026lsquosupportive environments to enable breastfeeding\u0026rsquoStained glass window of Sacred Heart over altar at St Michael\u0026rsquos Church Shroid is destroyedPolice make discovery after stopping Volkswagen Passat arriving at DoverCromane beach is third to be closed in Kerry due to heavy rainfallWater \u0026lsquoa little murky with a lot of seaweed\u0026rsquo amid pollution warning for the riverAmid water pollution warnings, 600 swimmers took part in the 100th Liffey SwimMore than 500 plants found in van on side of the motorway near Dunshaughlin, Co MeathGarda\u0026iacute believe 19-year-old from Tipperary may have reacted to bad batch of MDMA or ecstasyArsenic \u0026lsquoabove legal limit\u0026rsquo found in water from Aldi, Lidl, Dunnes Stores, Londis, Spar and other chains\u0026lsquoBiggest march in Northern Ireland is not orange or green, it\u0026rsquos rainbow coloured,\u0026rsquo Varadkar saysBuilding to be turned into Mary Robinson Centre, a US-style presidential library40-year-old held in connection with June 1st discovery of pipe bomb under car at Belfast golf clubResearchers reprogrammed human cells before injecting them in the monkey embryoParents Mitchell and Mair\u0026eacutead O\u0026rsquoGorman on greeting their two just in time for Twins DayBook extract: Edited extract from Angels with Blue Faces by Lyra McKeeMinister for Housing Eoghan Murphy may extend system for a further two yearsStrike plans have been signalled over two-tier pay structure and staffing issuesTwo-tier system to be rectified as health authorities struggle to recruit medical specialistsHarris argues for a compassionate approach, and promises \u0026lsquoa helping hand instead of just a handcuff\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3976667.1564844964!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"boy 15 and garda win 100th liffey swim races","story":"Over 600 swimmers took part in the 100th Liffey Swim on Saturday afternoon, despite a level of pollution recorded in the Dublin river this week which would close bathing spots covered by water quality regulations.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Sinead Delaney of Phoenix swimming club celebrates after winning the 100th Liffey Swim women’s race,.

It was easier to swim through.Delaney, from Dunboyne, Co Meath, finished in first place alongside her mother Joan, who also finished in the top 10\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspfor the women\u0027s\u0026nbspevent.“I’m absolutely delighted, I can’t believe it, just absolutely over the moon...I really didn’t expect this,” she said.Delaney, who is based at Garda headquarters in the Phoenix Park, took part in her first Liffey Swim 25 years ago, aged 13, alongside her mother.“I was trying to do it on my own and she says ‘mam can I come along with you’. I thought I’d have time on my own and I said ‘oh come on then’ so we’ve being doing it ever since,” said Joan Delaney.“I mean everyone’s pure desire is to win the Liffey and to win the 100th, it’s out of this world, it’s great.”Both women said the water was “a little murky with a lot of seaweed”, but that the crowds gathered for this year’s event were “brilliant”.“The organisers did a fantastic job with the publicity this year, it’s a huge honour to be part of it, never mind win it. It’s spectacular,”\u0026nbspDelaney added."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3976707.1564852920!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"liffey swim i wouldn t have missed it for anything","story":"Over 600 swimmers took part in the 100th Liffey Swim on Saturday afternoon, despite a level of pollution recorded in the Dublin river this week which would close bathing spots covered by water quality regulations.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinead Delaney, winner of the women’s race with her mother Joan, who finished 9th  in the  Liffey Swim. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe The O’Neill family, originally from north county Dublin, came from far and wide to take part in this year’s Liffey Swim.Colm (48), an organiser of the event, managed to get his brother Ciaran (49) home from Boston, his other brother Brian (45) back from London, while youngest brother Donal (38) travelled from Hong Kong.They were joined by their eldest brother Paul (51) from Dublin and the “honorary O’Neill”, their brother-in-law Keith O’Muiri, from Co Meath. “He’s our brother from another mother,” joked Ciaran.While three of the O’Neill men had taken part in the race before (Colm, Paul and Donal), this year’s event, which celebrated its 100th year, was the first time all five brothers swam the 2,200m down the River Liffey together.“It’s the first time we’re doing anything together since we were kids killing each other,” said Colm before the race.“It’s really exciting... It’s the 100th year and I thought it would be great to have five immediate brothers and a special brother-in-law who’s a sixth brother today.”The six men said they had no times in mind for finishing the event, merely stating “we’re just hoping to complete it”.Just after midday, the first batch of 600 swimmers began to enter the water, which was followed by a rendition of Molly Malone led by the Lord Mayor of Dublin Paul McAuliffe.The waiting participants, with their bright yellow swimming caps, on Victoria Quay threw their hands up in song while the hundreds of spectators gathered across the River Liffey on Wolfe Tone Quay joined in.As the fog horn sounded, the swimmers were off, with little care to the warnings Dublin City Council and the HSE gave about water samples being “exceptionally poor and could cause illness”.At the finish line, one of the oldest participants Claire O’Dwyer (77), from Killiney said the water was “very clean, with only a bit of seaweed now and then”.“It was very good, the water was very clear,” she said. Ms O’Dwyer, who has taken part in the race more than 20 times, said “I wouldn’t have missed it for anything”.“I couldn’t understand it because I’ve swam in much worse than that. That was clean compared to some years. There was no problem whatsoever.”Joe McSweeney (61) from Glasnevin was joined by his family at the end line, including his grandson Darragh (4).“I found it great, it was a fantastic swim, the water was good, great crowd, a very enjoyable day in all.“I found the water quality very good, there’s always queries every year about the Liffey but I think it was over exaggerated about the quality.”As for the O’Neill brothers, Keith O’Muiri or the “sixth brother” said “we survived it”.Teenager Mark Hanley (15) who is part of the North Dublin Swimming Club claimed first place in the men’s event with a time of 10 minutes, while Sinead Delaney, who swims with the Phoenix Club in Clondalkin, won the ladies’ event with a time of 5 minutes and 15 secoonds."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3976617.1564848400!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"second recall issued for bottled water due to above normal arsenic levels","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA number of types of bottled water from Aldi, Lidl, Dunnes Stores, Londis and Spar chains have been recalled over higher than normal levels of arsenic. A number of types of bottled water from Aldi, Lidl, Dunnes Stores, Londis and Spar chains have been recalled over higher than normal levels of arsenic. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) have issued a recall notice for: Aldi Comeragh (still and sparkling water), Applegreen (still), Broderick (still), Dunnes Stores (still and sparkling and flavoured), Itica (still), Lidl (still), Londis (still), Mace (still), Macari (still), Plane (still), San Marino (still) and Spar (still).“Arsenic was detected above the legal limit in several branded still and sparkling bottled waters,” the FSAI said. “The implicated batches are being recalled from consumers. Point-of-sale notices will be displayed in stores supplied with the implicated batches.”Retailers have been requested to remove the implicated batches from sale and display a recall notice. The FSAI said consumers are advised not to drink the implicated batches of water. “If you have consumed any of the affected batches and feel unwell, please contact your GP,” they added. In a statement Aldi said Celtic Pure had recalled some products “as a precautionary measure, due to the presence of arsenic above normal levels”. “All of the affected product has been removed from sale at all Aldi Ireland stores.”“Customers should be advised that they will continue to see Comeragh Spring Water for sale in some of our stores. This is because the product in these stores has come from a different Irish supplier and these products are unaffected.”“We apologise for any inconvenience and thank customers for their co-operation.”The supermarket said the bottles and multipacks of the Comeragh Spring Water range affected had batch numbers 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 177, 178,191,192, 199, 201, 202, 203, 204, 211, and 213.It comes after a recall earlier this week of two types of water from Spar and Londis stores.

Photograph: DENIS CHARLETAFPGetty ImagesFrench inventor Franky Zapata on Sunday succeeded in crossing the English Channel on a jet-powered hoverboard he designed.After a previous bid in July ended with him falling into the sea, Zapata took off from Sangatte, just outside Calais in France earlier on Sunday on a little platform powered by five small jet engines and carrying kerosene in a backpack.Flanked by three helicopters, he reached Britain in just over 20 minutes after a stop on a boat halfway through the 3km crossing to refuel, waving to onlookers before landing safely in Saint Margaret’s Bay, close to Dover on Britain’s southern coast.“For the last five to six kilometres I just really enjoyed it,” Zapata told reporters on arrival. “Whether this is a historic event or not, I’m not the one to decide that, time will tell.”“We made a machine three years ago . . . and now we’ve crossed the Channel, it’s crazy,” he said, before breaking into tears.Dozens of people came to cheer on Zapata at take-off, and a few residents and tourists gathered to watch the Frenchman land.“I really didn’t think he would make it but I was hoping,” resident Helen Reed said in Saint Margaret’s Bay. “Just to see him in the distance with my little binoculars, it was just amazing.”Zapata, who wowed crowds during France’s Bastille Day celebrations on July 14th by soaring over a military parade in Paris on the device, said on arrival that the hoverboard had reached speeds of 160 to 170km per hour during the crossing.The inventor had received a €1.3 million grant from the French army in late 2018 to help finance the development of the hoverboard.Britain’s Royal Navy has also shown interest in similar inventions, and said on July 30th it had carried out a successful test over water with “rocket man” Richard Browning, who hovered between vessels wearing a jet-powered body suit.Zapata’s biggest challenge was refuelling with another backpack, which required landing on a platform mounted on a boat.On his first attempt, he was knocked off balance in the process and fell, and he used a bigger boat and platform this time.He said on arrival it was not yet clear what the hoverboard might be used for, adding that it was a complex craft that the average person was unlikely to be able to navigate.“It’s not a machine for trip down to the bakery on a Sunday morning,” Zapata told France’s BFM TV in an interview. He said he was also working on a flying car. – Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Tory chairman refuses to rule out the prospect of a general election this yearIran seizes foreign oil tanker in Gulf smuggling fuel to some Arab states, state media reportsWhaley Bridge residents blocked from going back home by police who fear storm could cause dam to breachComment: I\u0026#39d rather be a tat-loving tourist than a traveller on holiday At least nine dead in second mass shooting of weekend in US as gunman targets Ohio barJeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s leadership \u0026#39has radicalised some Labour members into attacking Israel and Jews\u0026#39French inventor Franky Zapata has successfully crossed the English Channel on a jet-powered hoverboardPrince Harry thanks Meghan Markle for \u0026#39joining him on this adventure\u0026#39 in happy birthday message\u0026#39We were good men\u0026#39: Last words of SAS heroes murdered in cold blood during Second World War inscribed on memorial stone in FrancePatrick Crusius: El Paso shooting suspect fuels fears of increasing white supremacist threatEl Paso shooting: At least 20 dead as gunman opens fire in Texas WalmartDuke of Cambridge to kick off football season with mental health plea to fansComment: The Tories must form an electoral pact with the Brexit Party – or else they risk being annihilatedComment: Trump has turned American politics inside out – as we\u0026#39ll see in the next election\tCrufts urged to admit ‘retro pugs’ without squashed faces to wipe out cruel breedingGreen belt must be protected, poll shows, as Cabinet ministers back easing rules to build homesRelaxing green belt restrictions would be highly unpopular, campaigners warn PMCarl Beech\u0026#39s compensation payout criticised by mother who was refused money after holding her dying sonSocial media \u0026#39still not safe for children\u0026#39 says Molly Russell\u0026#39s father, as graphic self-harm remains on InstagramWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"best telegraph audio boris first 100 days 5g future","story":"Every Friday the  will bring you a selection of our best articles, comment pieces and features in audio form to be listened to at your convenience.This week saw Boris Johnson enter No 10, and promptly embark on a speedy cull of Theresa May\u0027s cabinet.Our associate editor Camilla Tominey analyses what the new PM\u0027s appointments tell us about his plans for the country.While Daniel Capurro looks at what Mr Johnson\u0027s first 100 days in office could look like.Elsewhere, the Technology Intelligence team discussed what 5G means for the future of city surveillance and Julia Bradshaw looked at who actually owns the North Sea\u0027s oil and gas.Here are this week\u0027s recordings:To listen,  click the \u0027play\u0027 button of the recording you wish to listen to.Who owns the North Sea\u0027s oil and gas?Who owns the North Sea\u0026#039s oil and gas?Analysis: What the new cabinet tells us about Boris Johnson\u0027s premiership Analysis: What the new cabinet tells us about Boris Johnson\u0026#039s premiership NOA  The first 100 days: What can Boris Johnson get done?Boris first 100 days NOADystopia or Utopia: will 5G pave the way for increased city surveillance?5G: dystopia or utopia?

4, 2019.French inventor Franky Zapata on Sunday succeeded in crossing the English Channel on a jet-powered hoverboard he designed.His first attempt last month was cut short when he fell into the water while trying to refuel.Escorted by three helicopters, Zapata glided across the water in the early morning light and landed in the picturesque bay, where dozens of onlookers and journalists awaited him.The five turbines on the former jet-ski champion\u0027s craft propel him at speeds of up to 118 miles an hour, powered by a backpack full of kerosene that can keep him airborne for around 10 minutes.He had planned to make the 22-mile crossing in 20 minutes, keeping an average speed of 87 mph at a height of 50-65 feet above the water.Frenchman who has spent years developing a jet-powered hoverboard will again try to zoom across the English Channel on August 4On Zapata\u0027s first attempted he tumbled into the middle of the busy shipping lane on July 25 after failing to land on a boat waiting in English waters to give him a fresh pack of kerosene.The trickiest part is really the refuelling, the 40-year-old Zapata said last Thursday. I didn\u0027t let up on the gas at the right moment.Aviation is the result of people who have had failures, and it\u0027s by getting back up that we move forward, he said.This time the refuelling boat was bigger and had a larger landing area, and French navy vessels in the area kept an eye out in case of trouble.Franky Zapata stands on his jet-powered \u0026#34flyboard\u0026#34 next to helicopters as he arrives at St. Margaret\u0026#39s Bay in Dover, on August 4, 2019French maritime authorities gave Zapata\u0027s team permission to keep the refuelling boat in French waters, something they had refused the first time around citing safety concerns.Zapata\u0027s team had been racing to repair the hoverboard after it was damaged from falling in the Channel waters 10 days ago.The main uncertainty this time around, Zapata said Saturday, was that his hoverboard might end up having a little problem.He explained, Normally we test the machines for several weeks before big events.

They also looked at whether the response was triggered accidentally, without a deliberate query from the user, the newspaper said.Amazon, which operates the hugely-popular Alexa assistant, is yet to make a similar commitment to Apple and Google, despite admitting in April that\u0026nbspemployees can listen to customer voice recordings\u0026nbspfrom Echo and other Alexa-enabled smart speakers.“This information helps us train our speech recognition and natural language understanding systems, so Alexa can better understand your requests, and ensure the service works well for everyone,” Amazon said in a statement at the time.“We have strict technical and operational safeguards, and have a zero tolerance policy for the abuse of our system. Employees do not have direct access to information that can identify the person or account as part of this workflow.”Additional reporting from agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Brexit turmoil was blamed for the fall, alongside a world economy undermined by trade tensions. On this measure, UK manufacturing has now shrunk for three consecutive months.\u0026nbspDowning Street and the Treasury declined to respond to Mr Carney’s comments, citing the need to respect central bank independence.\u0026nbspBut Peter\u0026nbspDowd, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury,\u0026nbspsaid the inflation report gave “a bird’s eye view of the mess the Tories have made of our economy, with slumping business investment, weak productivity, stagnant pay, and stuttering growth”.And Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman\u0026nbspChuka Umunna\u0026nbspsaid: “It is perfectly clear Brexit is already harming our economy: the manufacturing sector is nearing record lows and the pound is trapped in stark decline. How can the Tory government claim they can end austerity and grow the economy when their policy of Brexit is pushing it to the brink?“The Liberal Democrat message is now more urgent than ever: give the people a final say, stop Brexit, and with the country back on track, fix the economy. Stopping a no-deal Brexit is vital, but stopping Brexit altogether must be the goal.”Labour MP\u0026nbspRachel Reeves, the chair of the House of Commons Business Committee,\u0026nbspsaid it was “pure recklessness” on the part of the government that it had not ruled out no deal.The £2.1bn committed by Sajid\u0026nbspJavid, the chancellor, to no-deal preparations on Wednesday should be spent on reversing benefit cuts and investing in schools and hospitals, “not shoring up the defences against a tsunami”, said Ms Reeves.Minutes of the Wednesday meeting of the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, released at the same time as the forecasts, showed that the\u0026nbspMPC\u0026nbsphad voted unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.75 per cent.“The\u0026nbspMPC\u0026nbspjudges that underlying GDP growth is likely to remain subdued over the coming year, with Brexit-related uncertainties weighing on spending to a greater extent than in May,” the\u0026nbspBoE\u0026nbspsaid.\u0026nbspSpeaking to reporters, Mr Carney pointed out that business investment – which accounts for just over 9 per cent of Britain’s GDP – remains low both historically and compared with other countries.\u0026nbspPointing to another constraint on investment that is likely to persist beyond October, he noted that in recent months companies have grown less certain about Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU, with a long-term free trade agreement likely to take “some time” to negotiate. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A section of the dam wall at Toddbrook Reservoir in Derbyshire has collapsed following heavy rainfall in the areaA collapsed bridge near Grinton, North Yorkshire, after parts of the region had up to 82.2mm of rain in 24 hours on TuesdayAcrobats Beren d\u0027Amico, Louis Gift and Charlie Wheeller, from Barely Methodical Troupe perform a routine on Calton Hill in Edinburgh as they bring their debut show Bromance to the Edinburgh FringeTheresa the robotic waitress at The Tea Terrace\u0027s Cobham branch in Surrey.

What they do\u0026nbspknow is that the\u0026nbsproad ahead is\u0026nbsplooking\u0026nbsprockier by the day.\u0026nbspCarney reiterated that the Bank’s forecasts and projections are still predicated on a deal getting done, which is still more or less official government policy. But they’ve been downgraded, in part reflective of the fact that the UK economy has started to seize up as a result of all the uncertainty. \u0026nbspIn the meantime, he and his people have done their best to ensure that, for example, the banking system will be able to cope with the hard shock of a no-deal outcome. The big ones are pretty well capitalised. Hopefully we’ll avoid an RBS or HBOS 2.0 if the yucky stuff hits the fan courtesy of the Conservative Party’s descent into a nationalist pit and its determination to break the country on the back of its fevered fantasies.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Brexit turmoil was blamed for the fall, alongside a world economy undermined by trade tensions. On this measure, UK manufacturing has now shrunk for three consecutive months.\u0026nbspDowning Street and the Treasury declined to respond to Mr Carney’s comments, citing the need to respect central bank independence.\u0026nbspBut Peter\u0026nbspDowd, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury,\u0026nbspsaid the inflation report gave “a bird’s eye view of the mess the Tories have made of our economy, with slumping business investment, weak productivity, stagnant pay, and stuttering growth”.And Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman\u0026nbspChuka Umunna\u0026nbspsaid: “It is perfectly clear Brexit is already harming our economy: the manufacturing sector is nearing record lows and the pound is trapped in stark decline. How can the Tory government claim they can end austerity and grow the economy when their policy of Brexit is pushing it to the brink?“The Liberal Democrat message is now more urgent than ever: give the people a final say, stop Brexit, and with the country back on track, fix the economy. Stopping a no-deal Brexit is vital, but stopping Brexit altogether must be the goal.”Labour MP\u0026nbspRachel Reeves, the chair of the House of Commons Business Committee,\u0026nbspsaid it was “pure recklessness” on the part of the government that it had not ruled out no deal.The £2.1bn committed by Sajid\u0026nbspJavid, the chancellor, to no-deal preparations on Wednesday should be spent on reversing benefit cuts and investing in schools and hospitals, “not shoring up the defences against a tsunami”, said Ms Reeves.Minutes of the Wednesday meeting of the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, released at the same time as the forecasts, showed that the\u0026nbspMPC\u0026nbsphad voted unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.75 per cent.“The\u0026nbspMPC\u0026nbspjudges that underlying GDP growth is likely to remain subdued over the coming year, with Brexit-related uncertainties weighing on spending to a greater extent than in May,” the\u0026nbspBoE\u0026nbspsaid.\u0026nbspSpeaking to reporters, Mr Carney pointed out that business investment – which accounts for just over 9 per cent of Britain’s GDP – remains low both historically and compared with other countries.\u0026nbspPointing to another constraint on investment that is likely to persist beyond October, he noted that in recent months companies have grown less certain about Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU, with a long-term free trade agreement likely to take “some time” to negotiate. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A section of the dam wall at Toddbrook Reservoir in Derbyshire has collapsed following heavy rainfall in the areaA collapsed bridge near Grinton, North Yorkshire, after parts of the region had up to 82.2mm of rain in 24 hours on TuesdayAcrobats Beren d\u0027Amico, Louis Gift and Charlie Wheeller, from Barely Methodical Troupe perform a routine on Calton Hill in Edinburgh as they bring their debut show Bromance to the Edinburgh FringeTheresa the robotic waitress at The Tea Terrace\u0027s Cobham branch in Surrey.

compared with the price cap average of £1,254.Suppliers who claim to offer “100 per cent\u0026nbspgreen” energy tend to buy the majority of their electricity on wholesale markets, then buy certificates called “REGOs”, which guarantee the equal amount of electricity created from fossil fuels is matched by renewable generation.However, Good Energy uses power purchase agreements, which involve buying electricity directly from wind farm and solar generators.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.Founder and chief executive of Good Energy, Juliet Davenport, said: “Our tariffs genuinely support the growth of renewables and clean technologies. And because our customers have actively chosen to contribute to that support.“If we are going to tackle climate breakdown, iniduals must be empowered to choose to be part of the solution. We know customers want the ability to make that choice, and recently it has been complicated by energy companies taking shortcuts to offer cheap \u0027green\u0027 tariffs.”Regulator Ofgem had initially given Good Energy a temporary exemption in January when the cap was introduced. This lasted until the end of March, but was extended until September, and was finally made permanent.Ofgem said the decision was made because it recognised customers on Good Energy\u0027s standard variable tariff (SVT) had chosen to be on it, unlike customers who have been on SVTs for several years without necessarily knowing.Officials added that the support for renewables provided by the extra cash is “materially greater” than “regulatory mechanisms”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The worst reading since then was in June, an only slightly lower 43.1.“July data revealed declines in house building, commercial work and civil engineering, with all three areas suffering to some degree from domestic political uncertainty and delayed decision-making,” said Tim Moore at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.“If the current speed of construction sector retrenchment is sustained, it will soon ripple through the supply chain, and spillovers to other parts of the UK economy will quickly become apparent.”The measure of the sector’s optimism about the year ahead dropped to its lowest level since November 2012 as firms worried about Brexit, the prospect of a general election and delays to infrastructure work.In the nearer term, the outlook was also bleak as the number of new orders fell sharply, with firms blaming mainly a sluggish economy and political uncertainty.\u0026nbspHoward Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, pointed out this was the first time since 2016 that new orders had fallen for four successive months.\u0026nbsp“The weak July construction survey increases the concern that the UK economy has started the third quarter poorly, after GDP likely stagnated in the second quarter and could have contracted marginally,” he said.\u0026nbspThe PMI measure of the larger manufacturing sector, released on Thursday, was also weak, coming in at 48 –\u0026nbspthe same as in June and the lowest level in six and a half years.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.According to trade publication Pollstar, the Divide tour’s final show tally is 255, compared with U2’s 100 dates for their 360 Tour.The number of shows Sheeran played was key to him breaking the attendance record, as he played to an average of 34,541 per show compared to U2’s 66,091.He is currently enjoying a third week at the top of the UK album charts with No. 6 Collaborations Project, which features guest stars including 50 Cent, Bruno Mars, Justin Bieber, Chris Stapleton and Eminem.

And if you stand there long enough this summer, you’ll likely see some confused tourists rock up and ask for directions to “where the festival was held.” They won’t be the first to be told it’s about 50 miles that-a-way.\u0026nbspGrowing up in Woodstock I had to deliver the same news more than once. This August is the 50th anniversary of the most famous music festival in the world, but like the original 1969 concert, the official celebrations won’t come within miles of the Catskill Mountains town it’s named after. Fans will congregate in Bethel Woods, near\u0026nbspMax Yasgur’s farm, to see some of the big acts of the 1960s\u0026nbspsuch as\u0026nbspSantana and John Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival (both played those muddy fields 50 years ago), as well as Ringo Starr and his All Starr Band, while the town will carry on\u0026nbspin its own fashion, business as always. (The Woodstock 50 festival promoted by original Woodstock co-founder Michael Lang\u0026nbspwon’t be taking place.)But while Woodstock the town and Woodstock the festival are forever entwined in the public consciousness, Woodstock’s appeal and bohemian reputation isn’t derived from the festival. In fact, it’s the reason why the concert was meant to be held there in the first place.\u0026nbspFounded by the Dutch, carved out of the Great Hardenbergh patent purchased from local Indian tribes, and then English settlers, the town was incorporated in 1787. By the late 19th century, Woodstock, a farming community punctuated with lumber mills and tanneries, began attracting visitors because of its bucolic location less than 100 miles north of New York City in the Catskill Mountains. (For a comprehensive history there’s the 700-page tome, Woodstock: History of an American Town, by longtime Woodstock historian Alf Evers.)Created with Sketch.Woodstock Literary Festival: Literary luminaries descend on Blenheim Palace Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.But it was the utopian vision of one Englishman, Ralph Radcliffe Whitehead and his American wife, Jane Byrd McCall, that laid the foundation for Woodstock’s avant garde reputation over a century ago. The wealthy heir of a Yorkshire textile mill family, Whitehead entered Balliol College, Oxford, where he absorbed the social reformist philosophy of John Ruskin and the aesthetics of William Morris. The couple eventually found themselves in America looking to found an artists’ colony. In 1902, they bought 1,500 acres on the mountain above Woodstock, attracted by the Catskills’ wealth of natural beauty and access to New York City. The Byrdcliffe Art Colony was born.\u0026nbspByrdcliffe theatre was established in 1902 (Dmadeo)The creative community on the mountain slopes above town drew artists, craftsmen, sculptors and writers to live and work in the cabins and studios the Whiteheads had built. They created Arts \u0026amp Crafts furniture and decor along with pottery, textiles, and jewellery to be sold in New York City. In Whitehead’s free-thinking organisation, women artists were able to avoid some of the confines of society, and it attracted visitors such as\u0026nbspfeminist and suffragette Charlotte Perkins Gilman, writer Owen Lister, and naturalist John Burroughs.One of Whitehead’s early partners, Hervey White, broke away from Byrdcliffe to start the Maverick Arts Colony on the other side of town, attracting a like-minded set of artists and musicians. In 1916, White began the Maverick Concerts series, which is still running today in his hand-built concert hall, the oldest continuous chamber series in the country. The Maverick Festival was an open air, annual event held every year from 1916 to 1931, whose participants’ commitment to fun and freedom (and the local cider) were a precursor to the famous festival in 1969.\u0026nbspIn the sixties,\u0026nbspcame rock musicians such as Bob Dylan and The Band, and the hippies and\u0026nbspthe weekenders soon followed. Today, Woodstock’s year-round population is 6,000\u0026nbspbut swells to 12,000 when second-home owners are included. The mountains, the streams, and the nonconformist spirit also attracted musician\u0026nbspDavid Bowie,\u0026nbspwriters such as Neil Gaiman and movie stars like\u0026nbspUma Thurman. The Catskills region is so spread out and Woodstock’s population so immune to celebrity that privacy is pretty much guaranteed. Living in the woods up a winding mountain road helps too.\u0026nbspThe woods are indeed “lovely, dark and deep”\u0026nbsp… and quiet. For city dwellers the lack of all noise at night is startling and driving on pitch-black country roads takes some getting used to. Singersongwriter Amanda Palmer bought a house in Woodstock in 2013 in what she calls “a little bit of an accident” with her husband, author Neil Gaiman.Yasgur’s\u0026nbspfarm in Bethel, New York (Getty)\u0026nbspShe says at first she didn’t like Woodstock, she didn’t want to live in the middle of nowhere, knowing no one, but “the woods have made me submit. They tie me down at night and force me to see reason.” Gaiman and Palmer moved here more permanently a few years ago with their son, Ash. She composes at nearby studios and occasionally performs at local venues, while Gaiman has a writing cabin on their property. The town’s appeal is “the proximity to nature with proximity to the city,” Palmer says. “And the art colony set the stage. You only need a little bit of art in the water to freak a place out forever — artists can smell other artists.”\u0026nbspIt was this special reputation as a certain kind of cultural-rural paradise that drew my family here in the late 1970s from Brooklyn, along with a host of others looking for alternative lifestyles and health food stores, from former hippies to Buddhist monks. As a child, I roamed the woods, eating handfuls of wild blackberries and following mountain streams up bosky slopes. Growing up in a town like Woodstock, my name didn’t single me out at school although it did make me stand out, as I discovered in the course of researching this essay, when I found myself referred to in this 1987 New York Times article about Woodstock. That was weird.\u0026nbspIts appeal is the proximity to nature and the city ... And the art colony set the stage. You only need a little bit of art in the water to freak a place out forever — artists can smell other artistsI also spent an inordinate amount of time in that haven for bookish children everywhere, the town library. In the 1920s, as the artists settled into the town permanently, they became involved in the town and created civic institutions. Members of the Woodstock Artists Association donated art books and raffled off artworks to raise money to launch what is now one of Woodstock’s most beloved and argued over institutions, the Woodstock Public Library. A few years ago, the library revealed another Oxfordshire, this time to the town of Woodstock, England.\u0026nbspAfter bushes were cleared away from the front of the library, a golden stone was revealed, the limestone standing out from the local bluestone slate like the sun peeping through grey clouds. The inscription reads:In Kindred Sympathy and peaceful associationThis Stone from Blenheim Palace\u0026nbspIn the year of the Coronation of\u0026nbspFortunately there is an exhaustive and strangely compelling history of the library, The Story of a Small Town Library, which reveals that in the spring of 1937, the wife of sculptor Bruno Zimm (he was president of the library at the time) wrote to the mayor of Woodstock, in England, informing him of Woodstock’s upcoming sesquicentennial. The swift response came that the town would send a stone for Woodstock, New York’s war memorial. A check of the Archives at Blenheim Palace turned up no information, but the Oxfordshire History Centre found minutes from a quarterly meeting of the Borough Council stating that “His Grace the Duke of Marlborough has kindly given a stone from Blenheim Palace to be built into the War Memorial at Woodstock USA.”\u0026nbspWoodstock 50 announces eclectic lineup for festival anniversaryWoodstock festival is coming back for its 50th anniversaryWoodstock 50th anniversary festival to be held at original siteIs now a good time to let the good people of Woodstock, England, and the 12th Duke know that this mysterious war memorial was not built and eventually the stone was placed in an unused fireplace in the library for a decade because no one could figure out what to do with it? However, in 1948, it was used as a cornerstone for a new library extension and then moved to its present position when another wing was added 20 years later.Today, Woodstock is going through its next metamorphosis. Just as Woodstock once absorbed the artists and then the hippies, now the town is adapting to a permanent influx of temporary visitors brought by Airbnb. The town’s zoning laws have long kept out hotel development, which meant that visitors either rented a house for the summer or booked a room at of the few B\u0026ampBs or motels near town.But with Airbnb, renting a small cabin or a five-bedroom house with a pool is as easy as scrolling (if you search for Woodstock, NY more than\u0026nbsp300 rentals come up). The technology that allows someone to post their manbun\u0026nbspon Instagram, along with their\u0026nbspGPS so their friends can find them, while booking three nights in a house, coincided with the rise of the “maker”\u0026nbspculture, farm-to-fork dining, and handcrafted goods that Ralph Whitehead surely would have appreciated.You can’t find this as easily in the Hamptons as you can in the Catskills. These visitors want to sit around the firepit outside their cabin in the woods, not around a table at a nightclub, but they still want to go out for brunch the next morning. I had always thought Woodstock was impervious to change: the stores would sell tie dyes and Birkenstocks forever, and ageing hippies and tourists would always dine at the same three restaurants.\u0026nbspBut a new crop of shops and restaurants have opened to accommodate the demand for craft cocktails and eggs Benedict and designer fireplace accessories, with city prices to match. And while the Woodstocker in me is appalled at paying $12 for a drink, the Brooklynite thinks “Hurrah, lavender syrup!”\u0026nbspBut Woodstock’s unpolished, live-and-let-live appeal continues. True, there are more deer ticks and black bears than when I was a kid, but the frogs peeping down by the pond, the fireflies winking in and out at dusk, the green folds of the ancient mountains, the inky black sky full of stardust, remain as magical as ever. And there’s something more, something ineffable that keeps people coming here.\u0026nbspJazz great Sonny Rollins, who moved to Woodstock over a decade ago, says he felt that special quality when he visited for the first time. “When we came here, there was an aura in the town. It seemed to have a gentleness almost,” he says. “Artists and musicians and painters and writers – we don’t always feel comfortable in this world. Woodstock just had that feeling about it.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

compared with the price cap average of £1,254.Suppliers who claim to offer “100 per cent\u0026nbspgreen” energy tend to buy the majority of their electricity on wholesale markets, then buy certificates called “REGOs”, which guarantee the equal amount of electricity created from fossil fuels is matched by renewable generation.However, Good Energy uses power purchase agreements, which involve buying electricity directly from wind farm and solar generators.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.Founder and chief executive of Good Energy, Juliet Davenport, said: “Our tariffs genuinely support the growth of renewables and clean technologies. And because our customers have actively chosen to contribute to that support.“If we are going to tackle climate breakdown, iniduals must be empowered to choose to be part of the solution. We know customers want the ability to make that choice, and recently it has been complicated by energy companies taking shortcuts to offer cheap \u0027green\u0027 tariffs.”Regulator Ofgem had initially given Good Energy a temporary exemption in January when the cap was introduced. This lasted until the end of March, but was extended until September, and was finally made permanent.Ofgem said the decision was made because it recognised customers on Good Energy\u0027s standard variable tariff (SVT) had chosen to be on it, unlike customers who have been on SVTs for several years without necessarily knowing.Officials added that the support for renewables provided by the extra cash is “materially greater” than “regulatory mechanisms”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ticket prices include a carbon-offsetting levy, while even the soap in the stadium toilets is made with grass cuttings from the playing field.Most notably of all, perhaps, fans wanting a half-time pie or burger are offered vegan options only. The stadium is meat- and dairy-free, a state of affairs that has resulted in one of English football’s more surreal chants. “Where,” sing away supporters, “have your hot dogs gone?”Walking into the Forest Green Rovers’ 5,100 capacity stadium, The New Lawn in Nailsworth, there are immediate signs that this is a club on an eco-mission.UK ‘needs to plant 1.5 billion trees’ to tackle climate changeWild planting borders the ground a wind turbine stands in one corner the hoardings advertise things like Quorn and the Sea Shepherd conservation society.Vince, himself – T-shirt, jeans, earrings – buzzes about, speaking to players, groundsmen, kitchen staff. Somehow, he gives the impression of being both entirely energised and laid back to the point of being horizontal. During his 20s, he had repeated run-ins with police at a range of environmental protests, and, despite now\u0026nbspliving in a £4m mansion, still has the vibe of a man who’d consider chaining himself to a tree if push came to shove.The Independent is here because, if the UK is to achieve its now legally enshrined target of achieving zero carbon emissions by 2050, there’s probably no one better qualified to understand the possibilities and potential pitfalls than Dale Vince.After all, if he can make sustainability work in the entrenched, macho world of professional football, everything else should be a piece of dairy-free cake, right?“I would say 2050 is easily doable,” nods the father-of-two over coffee – liquid oats instead of milk – in the club’s green-walled boardroom. “Actually, I think in five years’ time, we could see that target coming down to 2040, which would still be achievable. But the super-important thing is that we now have this target because it’s an acknowledgement there’s a problem and that we have to get to grips with it.”He has previously donated money to both the Labour and Green parties but says he would work with the current Tory government on reducing climate change. He met Theresa May a couple of weeks ago to workshop ideas and would be available if he got the call from Boris Johnson. “This is the biggest problem facing the planet,” he says. “And it will only be solved by people working together.”That turning soccer sustainable hasn’t been easy, there can be little doubt.Rovers fans, certainly, have been known to voice scepticism about Vince’s methods since he took over the club in 2010. Specifically, they have voiced scepticism about their match-day sausage rolls disappearing.“I had someone say to me they used to be able to come here and have a pie and a pint,” smiles Vince. “I said you can still have a pie and pint – but our pies don’t have animal bits in and our pints aren’t made with fish bladders.”Another fan told him his ideas were feminising football. “I said I’ll take that and wear it as a badge of honour,” he says.Firms that don’t respond to climate change ‘will go bankrupt’- CarneyGreta Thunberg to sail across Atlantic for climate summitsGlobal heatwaves are pushing human bodies ‘close to thermal limits’How climate change and mass migration created a village of womenIs he forcing his values on others, though? “Look, there’s a football match here for two hours once a fortnight. So we’re not starving anyone off meat. We’re saying use that opportunity to try something different. And it’s super-tasty. Most people have come on board.”Fans visit from other clubs just to try the food, he reckons. Jamie and Jimmy have been here for their Friday Night Feast. When I later tuck into a burger and nut salad, I can see why. Put it this way, it knocks the socks off a cup of Bovril.Probably more significant in easing these changes through, however, is that they have come alongside – and probably helped bring – success.When Vince, who is originally from Great Yamouth, took over Rovers in 2010, they had just survived relegation to the sixth tier of English football and were facing a winding up order because of mounting debt.“The club asked for £30,000 to help survive that summer,” he recalls. “It’s been here 125 years and is a big part of the community, so why not help? Then in the autumn, that had run out. They said: you need to be chairman. And I said: I really don’t, I have enough going on. But it became clear it was a choice between taking responsibility or it folding. So, there was no choice, really.”There was never a set decision to take the club green as such, he adds – but he also saw no reason why his new project shouldn’t adhere to his lifelong belief in being low impact.Today, nine years on, the club is financially stable, established in League Two following promotion in 2017, and is currently applying to build a new stadium – a sweepingly beautiful design by Zaha Hadid, made all from wood and surrounded (but of course) by trees.Zaha Hadid Architects)Players and coaching staff have bought into Vince’s revolution pretty much from day one. They talk about feeling more energised because of their diet of suffering less soft tissue injuries of recovering quicker between games.“This is the way football is going,” manager Mark Cooper tells me. “Top players like Sergio Aguero have gone vegan to stay sharper longer, and more will do it. We’re just ahead of the curve.”The eco-identity, meanwhile, has created an overseas fan base among supporters who share the philosophy. This season’s new kit has sold in 16 different countries – unheard of for a club at this level. Last season, media from Russia, Japan, the US and Germany were all in the press box at some point.“You’re aware when you come here you have to buy into the principles and be willing to be educated” says defender Matt Mills. “And that breeds success. You’re constantly striving to improve because you’re part of a project that is so ambitious.”So ambitious, indeed, that the UN has now asked the club to lead its new Sport For Climate Action initiative, an international project which will see professional and amateur clubs across the world encouraged – and offered practical help – to reduce their carbon footprint. Many of the ideas shared will be taken directly from Rovers.“It’s pretty amazing,” says Vince. “We’ve gone from a rescue mission of a local football club to, nine years later, advising a global programme of work with the UN.”He shakes his head. “I wasn’t expecting that,” he admits.The journey to here, indeed, has been even more extraordinary when one considers that Vince himself spent much of his youth and young manhood living, as he calls it, “off grid”. As a teenager he dropped out of school early and then spent a decade travelling the country in an old army truck converted to use battery power.In 1991, he parked up on a hill in Stroud for a bit, realised a mini wind turbine he’d installed on the back of his vehicle was generating more electricity than he was using,\u0026nbspand had something of an epiphany.“I just had this moment where I’ve been living this low-impact lifestyle for 10 years,” he says. “And I thought I could spend another 10 years doing the same or I could drop back in to the world and try and build a big windmill on this hill, and do some good for the world.”He chose the latter got permission off the landowner (who was persuaded after Vince hooked up his caravan with electric lights) and spent five years constructing that windmill. His first customer, signed up in 1996, was a college in Cheltenham.“I told their energy manager, ‘You’ll be the first place in the country using green energy’,” he says. “I think he mainly just asked what the bills would be.”From there, Ecotricity, as he named the fledgling company, expanded rapidly.Today, it has 186,000 customers across the UK powered by 70 turbines, generating 80 megawatts of power. It has also opened Britain’s first solar farm, a five-acre site in Lincolnshire which adds another megawatt, and operates a vast network of electric car recharging points.And for the future?The company is confident it will continue to expand as more people – such as those young climate change activists – choose renewable, while Forest Green Rovers are aiming for nothing short of reaching the Championship: they kicked off the new campaign on Saturday with a 1-0 win at home to Oldham. All while continuing to prioritise sustainability in everything it does.“This way isn’t always easy,” says Vince. “But then nothing is, I think. When you’re challenging and pushing boundaries, it’s inevitable you hit obstacles and bumps in the road, but you keep going. It’s too important not to.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There are better alternatives to ISDS and the new trade secretary now has the chance to remove this unfair system from UK trade and investment.”UK officials insisted that investment protection agreements like ISDS do not hinder a government’s ability to regulate in the public interest and the tribunals enforcing them cannot overturn or force changes to laws.A Department for International Trade spokesperson said: “The government is clear that investors should able to access legal redress where they have been treated unfairly or had their assets seized without due process.\u0026nbsp“We are considering a wide range of options for future trade and investment agreements.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The worst reading since then was in June, an only slightly lower 43.1.“July data revealed declines in house building, commercial work and civil engineering, with all three areas suffering to some degree from domestic political uncertainty and delayed decision-making,” said Tim Moore at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.“If the current speed of construction sector retrenchment is sustained, it will soon ripple through the supply chain, and spillovers to other parts of the UK economy will quickly become apparent.”The measure of the sector’s optimism about the year ahead dropped to its lowest level since November 2012 as firms worried about Brexit, the prospect of a general election and delays to infrastructure work.In the nearer term, the outlook was also bleak as the number of new orders fell sharply, with firms blaming mainly a sluggish economy and political uncertainty.\u0026nbspHoward Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, pointed out this was the first time since 2016 that new orders had fallen for four successive months.\u0026nbsp“The weak July construction survey increases the concern that the UK economy has started the third quarter poorly, after GDP likely stagnated in the second quarter and could have contracted marginally,” he said.\u0026nbspThe PMI measure of the larger manufacturing sector, released on Thursday, was also weak, coming in at 48 –\u0026nbspthe same as in June and the lowest level in six and a half years.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Books spill out from the pavement stalls onto the street, where browsers kneel to rifle through an eclectic offering.Gabriel Garcia Marquez sits alongside a book of American idioms. Thick engineering textbooks compete with countless biographies of George Bush and histories of the US invasion. But the street has a story as gripping as any of the books on sale.\u0026nbspReligious books used to dominate the market. Then for years under the rule of Saddam Hussein, the sellers were restricted in what they could offer. “I was jailed for selling ‘The Generals are the Last to Know,’” says one stall owner who goes by the name Haider ‘Magazine’.Created with Sketch.40 books to read before you die Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing.

It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.“The idea of the book is that Saddam entered Kuwait without the knowledge of the generals. It was forbidden.”Mutanabbi’s Street’s troubles didn’t end with Hussein. In 2007, a car bomb ripped through the market, killing 30 people and injuring hundreds. It took years for it to recover.Today, the street is alive again, and the bestseller list is moving with the times.“The people who are buying are young people, honestly. They are currently looking for novels, or stories,” says Maher Muhammad, a bookshop owner on the street.“But this thing will not last. What do we say about that? It’s just like a pot will boil and collapse.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She gets very stroppy when on one of her freebie jaunts to Wimbledon some bloke near her has his mobile phone pointed somewhere in her vicinity.She bans the media from the christening of her baby and throws up a cordon around her home.But a moment later she’s guest-editing the pompous fashion magazine Vogue and revelling in the publicity. On the front cover she chose a bunch of “inspirational women” who she thinks are brilliant for their work in “consciousness raising”.They’re virtually all extremely affluent slebs who advance their own careers and incomes by occasionally parroting fashionable lefty b*****ks.Quite a few of them, such as the awful, third-ision TV presenter Jameela Jalil, are devoid of any talent at all.In the past, even genuine criticism of Harrynmeg has been met with accusations of racism.According to Harry — who at one time was an amiablerather dim rugger-bugger who enjoyed dressing up in Nazi unorm — many are guilty of “unconscious racism”.In , he complained publicly of “racial over-tones” in comments about Meghan.Listen, Ginge. There are many things I find objectionable about Meghan but nobody here cares that she’s of mixed race.Except maybe for some lefties who can’t stop crowing about “how far we’ve come”.For the rest of us it made no dference at all.Unconscious racism does not exist, by the way, Harry.Racism is something one does deliberately, with wicked intent.There was one inspirational woman missing from Meghan’s vomit-inducing front cover.A woman who knows the meaning of dignity, responsibility and duty and is the perfect role model for Meghan herself.Yes, love — it’s your gran-in- law.

part of a taxpayer- funded refurb which will cost nearly £million when all the costs are added.Royal accounts show work on the couple’s home has so far cost the public far more than original estimates, sparking fury from campaigners.Their five-bedroom property -

The reality is that maybe she only has time for one more.But, whether it’s for the environment or not, I don’t blame him for not wanting more than two children.I have two and the very idea of having had a third makes me feel weary. I’m just thinking of the sheer volume of childcare, laundry and meals required by each additional child.Sure, when it comes to considering whether two children is “enough”, Harry, left, and Meghan are dealing with dferent considerations to most of us.With hordes of staff, including nannies, cleaners and drivers, they could have multiple children and outsource ALL of the dficult stuffthey wanted to.But Harry and Meghan want to be hands-on parents — which can become exponentially harder with each child you have.Historically, there is pressure on Royal family members to have multiple kids.But, as with many other royal traditions, Harry and Meghan are planning to go their own way. And I commend them for that.I also think Harry should be applauded for speaking up about climate change, especially as this week the Met Office confirmed that the hottest years on record have occurred in the past ten years.So why shouldn’t he use his very public  to talk about things that matter to him and to try to inspire others But, as is often the case, this royal couple seem to be damnedthey do and damnedthey don’t.They’ve already learned the hard way — with their wedding their handling of Archie’s birth and their choice of residence — that you can’t please all the people all of the time.And that, in a way, is a liberation. Because all that is left is to please yourselves.  By ignoring pressures about how many children they “should” have, they are going to have as many as they damn well please.Although why they have to announce it is another question. Whatthey change their mind If they have two boys they might want to try for a girl. Apart from anything , you don’t know what your kids will ­contribute to the world.WhatThomas Edison’s parents had given up after two  .

They include China, Russia, Israel and Saudi Arabia, which Mr Johnson is likely to visit officially.    And with only an annual passport, that would mean Carrie spending a minimum of £ a year replacing hers – or £ for a more urgent frequent traveller renewal. A Whitehall insider said: “A passport is a valuable document. And the Passport Office takes a dim view of those who are careless with them. “That’s the reason for the -month restriction. And it applies to everyone without exception, including the PM’s girlfriend.” A No source said the claim about Carrie being so careless was “not true”.     But when told this, our Whitehall source laughed and said: “Classic denial.”If Carrie only has an annual passport, she could be in real trouble in the event her boyfriend gets his No Deal Brexit .Earlier this year the Foreign Office warned that EU countries could prevent Brit holidaymakers from entering without at least  months’ validity. Last week Carrie was seen slipping into Downing Street through a back door.

Luckily, a cyclist saw what had happened and sped through the oncoming traffic to thump on the car roof. The driver stopped the car and Joanna rushed to catch up with Jenny. ‘I was wailing at the top of my lungs,’ she says. ‘There were some teenagers at a bus stop nearby, and they got to her first and got her off the road. aposThey were amazingly kind and brave – she was covered in blood and in a mess but they were trying to soothe her. aposThe driver was even more upset than me, trembling and very tearful. aposHe told me he was a dog owner too and felt just dreadful. aposA kind woman got a gym kit out of her car, wrapped Jenny in it, and drove us to the vet.’ The vets whisked Jenny away and Joanna was left to wait helplessly for her husband Chris to arrive. ‘I thought the vets were going to say that there was nothing they could do because Jenny looked so terrible.    aposIt was just horric and I was sick with dread. aposHer paw pads had rubbed off all the way to the tendons. aposSomehow, she’d managed to stay standing up – the vets said thatshe’d fallen over onto her head or side, she wouldn’t have stood a chance of survival.’ The vets operated on Jenny straight away, stitching and stapling her paws back together. She was kept in for three days, then every day for five days after that, Jenny was given a general anaesthetic so they could rebandage her paws, but she was allowed home at night once her condition had stabilised. Jenny was given morphine for several weeks as she recovered and was floppy and tired at first. But after a couple of weeks she was able to totter around in her little bandage booties. As she couldn’t walk properly for six weeks, Joanna and Chris bought a special dog carrier so that they could strap her onto their fronts and take her everywhere with them. Saved from puppy farm  With no insurance, Joanna and Chris faced an enormous vets’ bill. ‘We stopped counting at £,,’ says Joanna. ‘The vets were confident her quality of le would be maintained after she had recovered – you can’t just knock a beloved pet on the head because they are expensive! But needless to say, we haven’t been on a holiday this year.’ Poor old Jenny had already had a rocky start in le. ‘She was a rescued from a puppy farm where she was basically being used as an ashtray,’ says Joanna. ‘She was burned, kicked and bashed. aposWhen a young couple adopted her from the Dogs Trust at  months old, she was so terried and trembly, that the couple had to adopt a second dog to keep her company and calm her down.’ All went well until five years ago when the couple orced and neither of them could manage two dogs. Joanna’s daughter saw a notice at work about the dogs needing a home, and suggested to her mum that they might enjoy taking on some pets.  ‘We’ve never had a dog before, but my husband loves walking and our daughter kept suggesting that we get a dog so that he’d have a purpose to his walks. aposWe just went to see them, but suddenly we were driving home with two dogs in the car.’ Jenny and the other dog, Ollie, settled in well, but the terrier’s le of adventure was only just beginning. ‘She got stuck down a badger hole a couple of years ago,’ says Joanna. ‘Somehow, she got tangled in the tree roots, so we went home and got our picnic chairs and waited for her to come out. aposEight hours later, she finally dug her way out but had rubbed all her fur from her face.’ Jenny’s escapades didn’t end there. ‘Another time, she was chasing a cat and hit a car. aposLuckily she just bounced off but she rolled down the road and the vet had to staple her back together again. aposPut it this way: she’s not a stranger to danger!’ Six months on from her accident, Jenny is happy and healthy.

He told childhood friend Marc Bott how he and we Kelly had given up hope of having a second baby because of a condition that could leave her in a wheelchairshe ever went through another birth. And when the mates met up at the boozer a couple of weeks later, the upsetting subject came up again – this time with troubled Paul reduced to tears. What happened next as the two men went home at the end of the night would change Paul and Kelly’s le forever. Because it led to Marc’s we Kim helping by becoming a surrogate mum for them. And the result is -month-old Riley, born through the amazingly close bond between the two families.  Overwhelmed Kelly, , told us: “I am so incredibly grateful. There are no words to say how thankful I am to Kim. “At Riley’s first birthday Kim sat there and looked around at all the people and said ‘this is because of me’ and it was. She has completed our family.” Kim added: “I feel I now have a really close bond with Kelly – she’s wonderful. I’d give her Riley again  times over. “It was all over a boozy pint. Our husbands just got chatting about it and that was that.” Kelly and Paul had first son Brody, five, in , but the pregnancy left Kelly in absolute agony and confined to a wheelchair from  weeks. She was suffering from SPD - symphysis pubis dys – a group of symptoms causing the pelvis to become unstable during pregnancy. The condition should have resolved itself after Kelly gave birth – but it didn’t and she now suffers daily pain. The couple knew a second baby was out of the question as it meant she risked being in a wheelchair permanently.Kelly, who runs an Instagram travel account, said she was so desperate for a second baby and a brother for Brody that she started to find it unbearable to look at pregnant women in the street.   The couple decided that surrogacy would be their only chance to expand their little family. After Paul, , had spilled out their desperate situation to Marc on the first night, the energy surveyor went home and told Kim, mum to his two daughters Penny, five, and Scarlett, three. Kim says: “Marc came in and told me they were considering a surrogate – and I said ‘Oh no way! Are they  “I could do that.’ Just like that. And my husband was like ‘yeah.’ “We both laughed it off. But I Googled it to see how it worked and what it entailed. Then he went out a second time with Paul and came back saying that he’d got all emotional because things were taking their toll. “Marc then said thatI did want to look at being a surrogate for them, we could. I thought, ‘What an amazing husband I have.’ Then I told him I’d already looked it up. I asked him how he’d feel about it as I’d be pregnant with his best friend’s baby. But he said, ‘ you want to do it, do it’.”    Kim then invited Kelly round and broke the news. “She got quite tearful and said ‘I can’t believe you would consider that’. I said ‘I can have a baby, I’m not bad at it, I’ll have yours!” Kelly recalls: “I was feeding her little girl and I just burst out crying. It was like ‘wow’. I wasn’t expecting it in a million years. She has a heart of gold.” The couples, of Warrington, Cheshire, chose the Manchester Fertility clinic and all had to have counselling and blood tests before being given the green light. Eggs were removed from Kelly through IVF, with eight fertilising. The first transfer in February  failed, followed by another failed second attempt. With costs spiralling – each transfer was £, – the couples crossed their fingers for third time lucky. On the third go, Kim fell pregnant. When she broke the news to me I turned to jelly,” says Kelly. “I was so happy. She is the best friend, an angel. Every step of the way she’s been my rock.” Marc, , was worried he’d get attached to the growing baby, so he avoided any hospital appointments and the birth. Kim says: “His view was ‘my friends are having a baby – it just happens to be in my we’. He felt the baby kick but there was no caressing my stomach.” Riley was induced at  weeks as Kim had suffered painful ribs during the pregnancy and the Riley was born last April, with Paul and Kelly both there. “I was thrilled to have Riley and so proud, but he wasn’t my baby,” says Kim. “I was never attached to him.    “Riley was placed on me, and that was enough. I needed that just to see him. I thought ‘Oh my God he looks so like Paul’. “Kelly and Paul were really happy to let me have a cuddle and a minute on my own with him.” Kelly adds: “I thought that it would be strange watching someone give birth to my child, but I’d do it again tomorrow. “When he came out we were all in bits. We were all crying. It was so emotional. My pregnancy was awful and horric but this one showed me how it should be.” Kim says the days after the birth were strange as she and Riley had kept waking up at exactly the same time for his feeds – even though they were now several miles apart. Now, both families are very close, with Riley and Brody almost like brothers to Scarlett and Penny. Kim went back to her job working in supported housing two weeks after the birth – but the experience has changed her le too. She now wants to be a midwe and begins her training next month.

However, they also have to consider whether refusing a gt would offend the person offering it. Gts from businesses If Meghan is sent a gt from a business, for example a shop or a fashion designer, these should normally be declined. Samples also have to be ed, unless it would cost too much to do so.    The only exception to this isthe gt is offered as a souvenir of an official visit.

Where’s the justice ” Nikita’s nightmare began when Jones moved into a second-floor flat overlooking her house in Leigh, Greater Manchester.    “He tried to be nice at first saying, ‘You’re gorgeous’ and flirting with me,” Nikita said. “One day I went for a cigarette in leopard-print shorts. He shouted, ‘Easy tiger,you come out in those shorts, I’ll rip them off you’. He was so creepy, I was terried.” When she shunned him, Jones threatened to rape her in public. He lunged at her three-year-old daughter screaming he would feed her to the sharks. Petried Nikita lost five stone over four months as crazed Jones followed her to shops and threw a glass at her two-year-old son. She says she called police over  times before he was finally arrested on May  for trying to break into her house with a crowbar. The next day, he pleaded not guilty to harassment. A court granted bail, but sectioned him and he was placed in local Atherleigh Park Hospital. “Friends and family kept telling me they had seen him,” Nikita said. “But I didn’t believe them. Then I saw him in a shop. I screamed.”  Jones changed his plea to guilty when he faced the harassment charge at Wigan ­magistrates court last Monday. But despite a long criminal record he was handed a jail term of  weeks, suspended for two years. At the time he started harassing Nikita, Jones was on probation after being jailed for  weeks for breaching a restraining order last September. Prosecutor Steve Woodman said Jones had a record of  offences and  convictions, including five for breaching restraining and non-molestation orders, and jail terms for harassment and attempted robbery. “This clearly shows a propensity to commit offences of a similar nature,” he said. Nikita has begged Wigan Council to rehouse her. “My house is a fortress. I have five locks and bolts on my front door and three on my back door. “My little girl still asks, ‘Mummy is the bad man going to take me ’ I reassure her, but I’m lying as he’s just down the road. “I’ve seen him with a kitchen kne and he’s made his hand into a gun and pretended to shoot me and made a slashing sign across his neck. His lawyer told the court he’s been diagnosed with schizophrenia and ADHD, but I don’t believe he’s crazy. He’s evil. “I used to be bubbly and outgoing. Now I’m a nervous wreck. He is a monster who’s ruined my le. And he’s got away with it.”    Greater Manchester Police said: “We remanded Jones in custody overnight so he couldn’t go near the victim. But the court released him on bail, which means they impose the conditions such as where he lives.” The Crown Prosecution Service said: “The judge made an indefinite restraining order to restrict the defendant’s access to the victim ahead of the trial.” Government agencies have been quick to pass the buck as to who is to blame for housing Jones so near his victim. The Ministry of Justice said: “If he has been sectioned then this is a matter for the Department of Health, as the Ministry of Justice would not choose the hospital.” The Department of Health refused to comment. Nikita is now backing the Sunday People’s campaign to help better protect stalking victims.

A gunman opened fire and killed shoppers at a branch of Wal Mart in El Paso, Texas yesterday. It happened six days after a teenage gunman killed three people at a summer food festival in Northern Calornia, and hours before another gunman killed people outside a bar in Dayton, Ihio this morning. The suspected shooter in El Paso was arrested at the scene, following a series of tragedies that will no doubt re-open the debate about gun control in the country. Hereaposs everything we know about the Texas incident so far. Who is the suspected gunman   The shooting suspect is Patrick Crusius, a -year-old from Allen, Texas. He attended Collin College in McKinney, Texas from  to , according to a statement from District President Dr Neil Matkin. Former neighbour Leigh Ann Locascio, told the LA Times Crusius was very much a loner. Why did the suspect say he did it   The FBI are investigatingCrusius is behind an anonymous white nationalist manesto published online. The manesto explains how the shooting was aimed at local Hispanics and police are treating the tragedy as a potential hate crime. It also expressed for support for the twisted gunman who killed  people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March. US representative Veronica Escobar told a press conference: Not speaking about this particular incident, which is still under investigation, but the manesto narrative is fuelled by hate, and itaposs fuelled by racism and bigotry and ision.  Witnesses described the gunman as very nonchalant, like he was on a mission as he reportedly went from aisle to aisle shooting people. What happened     The gunman, armed with an AK-, shot and killed  people at a Walmart store near Cielo Visa Mal in El Paso, Texas, at around .am on Saturday. At least  others were injured, police confirmed. Many shoppers in the busy store were buying back-to-school supplies when they found themselves caught up in horric incident. People at the scene fled for their lives, including Kianna Long who was at the Walmart with her spouse when they heard gunfire. People were panicking and running, Long said. They were running close to the floor, people were dropping on the floor. Video footage from the scene showed victims lying on the ground inside and outside the store. One shopper told Reuters the gunshots sounded like they began outside the building. The suspect surrendered himself to police at the scene and was taken into custody. In the shootingaposs aftermath, Walmart and adjacent businesses, including the mall and a movie theater, were closed as police conducted an initial search for additional possible suspects. Authorities later said the gunman had acted alone. The carnage ranked as the eighth-deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, after a  shooting in San Ysidro, Calornia, that claimed  lives.Who are the victims     The victims of the attack have yet to be named. Three of them are said to be Mexican, according to Mexicoaposs President Manuel Lopez Obrador. A further six Mexicans are reportedly injured, Mexicoaposs Foreign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard added. El Paso Police Chief Greg Allen said the ages of victims were numerous. Children and babies are said to be among those injured. Two hospitals in the area said they received at least  people, CNN reports. Eleven victims were transported to the Del Sol Medical Center where nine remain in critical condition. At least two patients are in a le-threatening predicament, the hospital confirmed.The victims range between the ages of  to .What has the response been so far        The shooting has sparked widespread condemnation from US political figures and people around the world. US President Donald Trump described the shooting as an act of cowardice. He wrote on Twitter: Today’s shooting in El Paso, Texas, was not only tragic, it was an act of cowardice. I know that I stand with everyone in this Country to condemn today’s hateful act. There are no reasons or excuses that will ever justy killing innocent people. Melania and I send our heartfelt thoughts and prayers to the great people of Texas. Texas Governor Greg Abbott described the shooting as one of the most deadly days in the history of Texas.

But trippers are snapping up swastika mugs, Hitler busts and other ­memorabilia of hate at a tourist site. Predappio in Italy is becoming a mecca for extreme right-wing ghouls – many from Britain – because fascist dictator Mussolini is buried there. The Sunday People travelled to the town  miles north-east of Florence as bus-loads visited the former Italian ­tyrant’s crypt to mark his birthday. Some performed Nazi salutes while others shouted about sending their enemies “to the ovens”. And they browsed shops selling ­everything from smiley Hitler T-shirts to babygrows with figures performing fascist salutes. One shopkeeper said: “The English are our biggest customers after Italians and French. They come here because this is where Mussolini is buried.” The crypt is opened three times a year to mark the birthday of Hitler’s pal on July  , his death on April   and his march on Rome when he seized power in .    Many want it opened all the year round to boost trade. Pierluigi Pompignoli, who owns the most popular souvenir shop in Predappio, Tricolore, described his far-right products as “antiques”though most appear to be freshly made. He said: “It is not weird for us to sell these antiques. We’re not doing ­anything wrong.”  Askedhe is a fascist, white-haired Mr Pompignoli – who claimed he could be arrested for performing what he calls “a Roman salute” – replied: “I am a Mussolini supporter. “I am not against immigration. One thousand people is OK but , is too many. “I want the crypt to be opened ­because it will be good for my business. Shops here need the extra business.” He is backed by the town’s first right-wing mayor for  years, Roberto Canali, who was elected in May as the far-right movement made major gains across Italy.  Mr Canali, who was born and raised in Predappio, says he is not a Mussolini supporter but is in favour of opening the dictator’s crypt full-time. Sitting in his grand office, where Mussolini once sat, he said: “I think it could bring , visitors a year to the town, which would be worth over €million in revenue.  “I met with Mussolini’s great-grandson Caio on Sunday and he said he would like it to be reopened. The ­people  here want it because of the money it will bring. “I don’t think it will attract more ­fascists. I think normal people will come out of ­curiosity. We want to attract good tourism. “I hope the crypt will be open by the end of this year and I think it will happen.”  Speaking about the shops, he claimed: “I’ve never been into the Tricolore shop so I’ve never paid much ­attention to what it sells. Told it sells swastika ­armbands, he said: “I want to thank you for bringing this to my attention. I will raise it at our next meeting.”  He added: “The shops are unique to this area. They are quite visually striking and may be considered disrespectful. “They can sell souvenirs because they comply with the law, but ­maybe they should keep a lower profile while doing so.” Predappio’s former mayor Giorgio Frassinetti tried – and failed – to close the dubious memorabilia shops ten years ago.  “We cannot talk about normal tourism when we speak about people visiting Predappio,” he said. “Tourism here is not normal and we should not be naive about it. The people of Predappio began to lose their dignity when these shops were opened. “They’re selling out their dignity, but sadly everything is driven by ­money. I feel bad that fascist symbols are sold and tourists go there to buy these kind of products. They shouldn’t be a tourist attraction. “People who came here last week to mark the anniversary of Mussolini’s death were shouting, ‘Send them to the ovens.’ It is terrible.”    Dubbed Il Duce, meaning The Leader, Mussolini allied with Adolf Hitler’s Germany in the Second World War and was ­responsible for , deaths. Italian partisans shot him in  and hung his body upside down beside those of his mistress and other fascists in Milan.  The remains were hidden until they were brought to the family crypt in his birthplace in . Miro Gori, president of a local anti-fascist group, said: “On the day of the anniversary of Mussolini’s death last week we reported many instances to the police of people being extremely right wing. This kind of tourism is worse than sick.”  He added: “I am extremely ­worried about the rise of right-wing politics here in Italy and other parts of Europe. These people are focusing on ­hatred and are very racist and against immigrants. “I want to thank the Sunday People for ­highlighting this. It is an ­important to tell people what is happening.” The nationalist anti-immigration far-right wiped out traditional centre party leaders in May’s European elections.

The -year-old Spaniard who was targeted in the random attack cheated death after falling in the hole between the tracks. Horrying footage showed the aggressor coming up behind the man as the tube train approached the crowded  and sending him over the edge with the karate-style kick. The incident took place just before am yesterday morning in Arguelles metro station, in the central Madrid neighbourhood of the same name. Police sources quoted by the Spanish press said the Brazilian was wearing Mixed Martial Arts gloves used in the full-contact combat sport when he was arrested.  The victim miraculously suffered only minor injuries with the train missing him by inches because of his quick thinking. The CCTV footage of the nightmare incident showed him recovering in a split-second and managing to get to the side of the track out of the way of harm. Other commuters, some of whom were initially filmed running for safety in their confusion over what had happened, held the -year-old Brazilian before he was taken away by security guards and handed over to police to be arrested on suspicion of attempted homicide. Local reports said he was was known to police following a spate of incidents in recent weeks which included two arrests for wounding.  Respected Spanish newspaper El Pais said he had been detained on June  after smashing up a bar and attacking clients and the owner. One of the people he attacked is said to have suffered a broken elbow. Paul Crossley, , was jailed for le at the Old Bailey in June for pushing former Eurotunnel chairman Sir Robert Malpas off the at Marble Arch station on the London Underground in a random attack.

No player in the europa League or Champions League has netted as many as goal machine Cosgrove.However, McInnes insists Main can provide strong competition for Cosgrove which can only spell danger for rival defences.A summer capture having left Motherwell at the end of last season, Main has been hitting the heights in training, says McInnes.Main was left out of the squad for the - europa League destruction of Chikhura Sachkhere as a precaution having picked up a thigh strain.He is expected to be fit to face Hearts in today’s Premiership opener at Pittodrie.McInnes said: “Curtis Main will be a very important player for me and Sam Cosgrove sees that as well.“Curtis has been fantastic in training and is bursting to go.“He has been doing all he can to get involved.“I have no doubt in my mind that although Sam is scoring goals he will see how well Curtis has been doing in training.“Sam has started the season well and knows he has real competition from Curtis.“I feel as though I have the benefit of having a couple of really strong strikers up there.“Having that competition is good for everyone.”Main has only featured as a substitute competitively for the Dons so far, coming on midway through the second half of the - defeat of RoPS Rovaniemi in Finland in the Europa League first qualying round.Having picked up a minor thigh strain in training  hours before Thursday’s clash with Chikhura Sachkhere Main was not risked – with the Hearts game in mind.McInnes said: “Although Curtis picked up a wee strain he will hopefullly be okay.”McInnes aims to freshen up his squad for the Premiership opener after their Euro rigours.Aberdeen begin their domestic campaign with the Pittodrie clash today.He said: “Hearts will be rubbing their hands at the amount of energy we put out in the euro tie and that is our biggest concern.“We have dealt with the European games now and it is important we regroup for Hearts.“I took players off against Chikhura and kept players back with Sunday in mind.“We will try to get as fresh a team as possible out there to deal with what will be a tough game but an exciting one.”Aberdeen will be without centre-backs Mikey Devlin and Ash Taylor tomorrow.Taylor suffered a hamstring injury in the - first-leg draw with Chikhura in Georgia last week. Scan results confirmed Taylor will be sidelined for up to a month and will miss the Europa League third qualying round ties against HNK Rijeka.McInnes said: “Sometimes when you play in Europe the excitement and anticipation of the first league game proper can be diluted.“However, everyone who was at Pittodrie on Thursday will be back and Hearts will bring a big support.“So the game will generate a fantastic atmosphere and hopefully we deliver a performance that gets us three points.”McInnes anticipates a testing league opener against a Hearts side strengthened during the summer transfer window by boss Craig Levein.The Jambos have secured Scotland international striker Steven Naismith on a permanent four-year deal following his exit from Norwich City.Naismith, , spent the last  months on loan at Tynecastle, scoring  times in  appearances.Despite suffering injury and undergoing two knee operations last season, Naismith was Hearts’ top scorer with  goals in  gamesAlso signed were former QPR and Sheffield United striker Conor Washington and ex-Livingston defender Craig Halkett.Scotland Under- international Jamie Walker has ed to Tynecastle following a season with Wigan Athletic.McInnes said: “Hearts will be tough and the four signings they have made have been very good.“Washington has a pedigree, Walker did well at Hearts previously and Halkett is a player I really like who will do fantastically well for them.“Naismith is a huge boost for them because for me he was arguably the best player in Scottish football last season until he suffered his injury.“It is important for us we start our domestic campaign with a win and hopefully we can do that.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.42071692-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.42071692-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.42071692-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.42071692-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"young aberdeen fc star sets sights on shire cup success","story":"Young Don Michael Ruth is targeting success in the Evening Express Aberdeenshire Cup.Aberdeen’s reserves are through to the quarter-final of the famous old tournament after Wednesday’s - win over Deveronvale.Later this month Paul Sheerin’s Reds tackle Banks o’ Dee in the quarter-final.Striker Ruth, a summer signing from Queen’s Park, has aspirations to go all the way and win the Shire Cup for the th time in Aberdeen’s history.The -year-old said: “Being into the next round means we’ll get another hard game.“These games are good for us against older men, so we want to have more of them.“The aim right now is to try to go on and win the cup.“If we play to our best we feel we could go on and win the cup, but it will be hard.“Games like Wednesday’s are a challenge for us.“We’ve had the same in pre-season, we’re playing against older men, it’s more physical.“So they are tough games but it’s good to have them and get us started for the season ahead.”Ruth netted the second goal at Princess Royal Park on Wednesday from the penalty spot in stoppage time.For the first  minutes, Dons first-teamer Stevie May was alongside him in attack.May was getting minutes after a proposed move back to St Johnstone fell through last weekend.Ruth enjoyed playing alongside the Scotland cap and added: “I can take a lot from Stevie’s game.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

He turned Duncan MacKinnon inside-out before flicking an inch-perfect ball to Fraser Watt on the left of the D and he slammed the ball high into the middle of the goal from  yards to make it -.Lochaber had their first shot on goal on six minutes when Ben Delaney found space on the left but his strike went wide of the left-hand post.Inveraray were showing good movement up front and they increased their advantage on nine minutes. The goal came from a corner and Garry MacPherson caught the Lochaber defence napping as he played the ball low from a wide area towards the front post where full centre Lewis MacNicol waltzed into the box and his first-time shot beat the helpless Callum MacDonald to make it -.Lochaber keeper MacDonald pulled off a great save on  minutes as he blocked Garry MacPherson’s fine drive from the left with his chest before clearing the ball to safety.Lochaber’s Ben Delaney and Stuart Callison tested Inveraray keeper Scott MacLachlan but it was the Winterton side who would add a third goal on  minutes. Again the goal came from Lewis MacNicol winning possession, this time deep in Lochaber territory, and he found the ever-alert Garry MacPherson whose defence-splitting pass picked out Fraser Watt running in unmarked through the heart of the Lochaber defence and he slotted the ball low past the keeper from close range.Lochaber were now up against it but, on  minutes, Conor Sweeney took a corner from the right, sending the ball into the danger-area. Stuart Callison found space to slam the ball goalwards and although Scott MacLachlan saved with his feet, he was unable to get the ball away and Ben Delaney was quick to react as he poked the ball over the line to make it - at the interval and give Lochaber hope.Lochaber started the second period with intent and Scott MacLachlan pulled off a great save to thwart Stuart Callison on  minutes.However, Lochaber’s never-say-die attitude got them right back into the match with just  minutes remaining. Lachlan Campbell played the ball across from the right and it came perfectly to the on-running Findlay MacDonald and his  yard shot from the left flew past the keeper to make it -, setting up a tense finishLochaber had a great chance to snatch a point on  minutes when referee John Angus Gillies awarded them a spot-hit, penalising keeper MacLachlan for a “kick” inside the D. Ben Delaney’s well-struck effort went straight down the middle and MacLachlan redeemed himself, saving superbly with his stick before clearing the ball for a corner.Inveraray saw out the rest of the game to claim two valuable points in what was a cleanly fought contest with no cards shown.The win sets Inveraray up for another crucial relegation battle this time at Kilmallie this coming Saturday.Caberfeidh  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from behind to beat Caberfeidh - in their pm throw up at Castle Leod.Caberfeidh have been on a bit of a scoring spree of late and they took the lead in the opening minute through Craig Morrison.It didn’t take Kyles long to level with Ross MacRae netting on  minutes and Colin MacDonald’s effort on  minutes meant they went into the break - ahead.Ross MacRae got his second on  minutes with Colin MacDonald doing like-wise with just  minutes remaining.Mowi South Division Inveraray  Kyles Athletic The Inveraray seconds and the Kyles Athletic seconds met in a match originally rearranged Thursday  July which was then put back  hours.Kane Kirkhope was playing in a more advanced role for Inveraray and he scored a well-taken goal in eight minutes after some impressive forward play.John MacKenzie was working hard in the middle of the park and he set up Inveraray’s second goal on  minutes.

Day one saw us head out from Carloway aboard the SYSAC II under the watchful eye of skippper Robbie Bell who knows these waters like the back of his hand.The day kicked off with a bait hunt in the East Loch but the mackerel were pretty scarce, it took an hour or so to fill the baskets before steaming out to the two-mile mark in search of spurdogs. By then there was a fair wee wind picking up and it was a tad rough to say the least, with the heavy swell claiming a few breakfasts along the way.All that was soon forgotten as the battle commenced with the mighty spurs. The action started on the first drop with some thumpers coming aboard, single and double shots causing mayhem thrashing about the deck and we lost count of the number of rigs sliced through on the way up. But that’s what we came for, not everyone’s choice but great sport all the same.In between the madness we picked away at the haddock, whiting, grey and red gurnard, ling and pollack, until we had our quota and decided to seek the smoother waters of East Loch Roag for some flattie bashing on the soft ground. It was good to get into the calm and fish the light gear, picking away for dabs and plaice. There was plenty around, nothing huge but a steady flow coming aboard taking us to the end of the day with a good mixed bag of species.Day two set off in brilliant sunshine and not a breath of wind, it was almost tropical conditions. We quickly got our supply of fresh bait in West Loch Roag and set off for the rough ground in search of a few more species, but there was little or no drt so we took a turn into Clf Bay and settled in for a day on the rays. It was brilliant fun, everyone got their fair share with loads of thornback rays and a few spotted rays coming aboard, plenty of dabs, plaice, dogfish and a bonus lb oz turbot to add to the tally. It was a great opportunity to brush up on some of fishing techniques that don’t get practised much at home.We decided to hit the hard ground on the way back to the harbour. It was quite slow, maybe a wee bit early yet, but it produced more haddock, a lovely lb cuckoo wrasse and pollack bringing our two day adventure to an end. All in all another excellent club trip.This year we picked up  species,  counting fish and a few personal bests. Add to that, great company, loads of banter, a good skipper who makes a mean cup o’ tea and you have the ideal ingredients for another memorable few days away on Lewis. We’ll be back next year for sure.Results: Nikki Thompson  points, Robert MacBrayne , Nick Friel , Jim Smith , Gary Sinclair , Steven MacBrayne ."},{"url":null,"title":"districts","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsPreserving historic KilbrideA GoFundMe donation page is making the rounds after community group Friends of Kilbride made a plea for funds to preserve historic Kilbride.Kilbride, located three miles south of Oban, includes the ruins of a th-century church, Clan MacDougall’s memorial aisle and an extensive graveyard dating back many centuries.

He decided to do the next lollipop and then see where he was on the straight but in his enthusiasm got to him and he understeered into the bales bouncing off them, hitting his bonnet. He also noticed the brake pads were rattling more than usual and it turned out they had lost a pin. The team had to improvise with spare tyre borrowed from Allan Wallace which didn’t quite fit but they wired it in and it lasted.Class  had  STRC registered crews this year and top spot and current championship leader in class went to Colin Gemmell in the Mark  Escort.

Nothing could touch his car which stuck to the road like glue.Inglis said: #Overall victory and a class win  Can’t get any better.#Robert Marshall in the Mark  Escort was looking forward to some decent results but an issue on day one with the car losing all its water put an end to any real chances and on day two an engine mount broke putting an end to what Robert described as a perfect weekend.Ross Auld was a welcomethe Mark  Escort and also managed a couple of days assistance in setting up the venue. Ross had managed to set some decent times on Saturday but late in the day the alternator belt snapped and took with it the dry sump belt causing the engine to cease. Ross loaded up the car and headed home and by the Sunday evening he had the engine out the car ahead of its rebuild.Class  saw four STRC registered crews compete in Kintyre this year and top of the list was Greg Inglis in the Lotus Exige. Greg exited the last stage on the Saturday and noticed the rear brake calliper hanging off.

Greg finished a respectful fth overall and took the class win.Second in class and th overall was Michael Harbour in the Mark  Escort, on the back of electrical problems that saw the team fail to finish the last round at Crail the team have now got the car singing on the stages. Michael didn’t report any issues during the weekend and brought the car home in one piece.Michael Robertson isn’t having the best of luck this season as the Honda Civic Type R driver reported issues with the CV joint that led to driveshaft and df failure but as usual the team loved the event and will be back for sure.Class , with eight registered STRC in class  the battles were all tensely close. Taking top honours in the class was Kyle Adam a full two minutes ahead of nearest class  car of Des Campbell. Kyle also managed a top  overall clinching th spot and despite some overheating at one point the car ran faultlessly doing his championship hopes no harm.Lochgilphead local, Jamie Miller in the C R Max loves the track and had the luxury of booking indoor servicing. With navigator Ian McCulloch, his biggest problems were brake related but with some fluid changes and adjustments it was just all back to normal for the team finishing a well-deserved th overall and fourth in class.Kayleigh Strachan in the Citroen Saxo finished th in class on the event and th overall but managed to pick up  points and th in class in the STRC.Gary Coutts in the Fiesta commented after the final stage on the Sunday that on the second to last stage of day one he developed a few ‘minor’ issues. A change of driveshaft, ball joint, wheels and tyres seemed to cure the problem. With an early start on the Sunday morning the car was back on form.

If people need  ron they should be able to get it locally, particularly where there is more than one petrol station.#Narrowing the choice and making people drive to buy petrol is never a good idea.#In response, Lockhart Leitch said: #The reply from Esso is, to my mind, a typical big company response.

It would be hard not to notice the single imposing figure of the dersquoil amongst the floral sea of youngsters.John Cockburn, clad in a black cloak and hood, carried the fiery red head of the dersquoil mounted on the top of a stout pole draped in red cloth. Itrsquos an eerily unnerving sight that Irsquom sure sent shivers down the spine of many since it was carved in .To the sounds of the pipes and trumpets, local bands joined the parade which halted briefly near the top of Waverley Road for Dux Boy Aaron Glendinning to hang a wreath at the wall plaque commemorating John Euman, who acted as Master of Ceremonies at the Cleikum for almost  years.This ceremony was repeated at the plaques on the wall of the Burgh Chambers to former Games Chairman Walker McLaren and John A Anderson, one of the instigators of the Cleikum Ceremony.An act of kindness was carried out at the end of the parade as children handed their flowers to committee members which would be delivered to local hospitals.The procession, which opened the nd Anniversary of St Ronanrsquos Border Games, took the form of a massed bands display. St Ronanrsquos Silver Band and Peebles Burgh Silver Band combined to present a most impressive march along Innerleithen High Street just after the Race Roond the Toon.Large crowds lined both sides of the High Street to witness this spectacle. The march played was The Pride of Princes Street. Huge crowds gathered on both sides of the street to support both of Innerleithenrsquos fine bands and to enjoy the music at this yearrsquos Beating of the Retreat.Presiding over the performance was the President of St Ronans Border Games Alan Patterson along with St Ronan and the Dux Girl, Standard Bearer Ronan Caine and Lass Caitlin Urquhart, their supporters, Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James, and his we Sarah, the monks, and the dersquoil.The two town bands marched on together under the expert direction Band Sergeant David Lindsay playing Scotland the Brave. The Pipe Band then performed an excellent Drummerrsquos Call followed by the traditional Retreat marches Greens Hills of Tyrol, The Battles Oer and Lochanside.Next the Silver Band played an upbeat version of the Queen hit, Fat Bottomed Girls which featured one of the bandrsquos percussionists, Cameron McCreadie, on drum kit and soprano cornet player, Simon Railton, as soloists.The Pipe Band followed on with a rendition of their new competition medley set comprising a iety of time signatures, featuring an emotional arrangement of the slow air Mingulay Boat Song.More marches back and forth had the crowds clapping and tapping their feet before it was time for the combined piece, which was a beautul arrangement of The Rose of Kelvingrove featuring Pipe Major Gillie as soloist. The Silver Band then rendered Sunset with Callum Anderson and Callum Robb sounding the calls. The hymn tune Eventide was played by principal cornet player, Callum Robb, and conducted by Band Secretary Keith Belleville.Games President Alan Patterson then gave permission for the Bands to take their leave. To resounding applause, the bands marched off playing On, StRonans, On!.There was only one important task that remained, the matter of the dersquoil. We were honorary torch bearers lighting the way for our neighbours the St Ronanites, to burn an effigy of the dersquoil.I quickly ran to the High Street for a prime view of the black cloaked carrier of the dersquoil, monks dressed in their habits chanting and punching their croziers in the air, Standard Bearer Ronan carrying the Blue Banner.

I can only compare it to watching the village mob with torchlights off to kill the beast in the classic Disney film.The friendly Innerleithen mob halts on Hall Street and the dersquoil strangely disappears out of sight.I think of the Cleikum Ceremony and remark to my husband, who carried out the duties of the Dux Boy in, how nice it is that the old customs and traditions exist today, said exactly as it was since its inception in .He recalls word for word the outgoing speech of the Dux Boy which makes me think back to the words of Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James: ldquoInnerleithen and the Games will be in your DNA forever. Never a truer word. You can take the man out of Innerleithen but yoursquoll never take Innerleithen out of the boy!We begin the climb of Curly Hill to the soul-stirring sounds of the Pipe Band. It is dark and the fire-lit torches have been extinguished. The climb feels never-ending and locals start to sing On St Ronanrsquos On. We finally reach the top and, as I look out over the valley, it is simply breathtaking. Some things are better felt that telt.My eyes are drawn to the dark figure that sits on the pyre. A haunting figure approaches bearing a flame, St Ronan has ed in the form of Aaron Glendinning. The pyre bursts into flames and the crowds on the hillside cheer the effigyrsquos fiery demise. Fireworks then light up the dark sky.The dersquoil is now in ashes and the evil spirit has been banished once more. And I, along with the people of Innerleithen, head safely home after truly enchanting evening."},{"url":null,"title":"cyclists-set-leg-lavender-touch","story":"A CYCLING team which has raised tens of thousands of pounds for charity is preparing for its toughest challenge yet.The Over The Hill cyclists are in serious training ahead of their  Border Settlements which will see them complete  miles over three days.The nine-man team - which includes Keith Irvine, Stevie Halls, Sinclair Paterson, Ronnie Murray, Josh Irvine, Kevin Mania, Alan Brown, Doug Welsh and Chris Lightfoot - are tackling the route for the Lavender Touch, a charity which raises funds for people in the Scottish Borders living with cancer.The team have previously cycled  miles from Settle in Yorkshire to Galashiels in aid of Prostate Scotland in , and  miles for the Rowan Boland Memorial Trust in .Stevie Halls said: \"The team, which has an age range of mid-s to over , will be passing through over  towns, villages and hamlets in a journey of  miles across the Borders.\"The route mirrors the geographic reach of the Lavender Touch and although our trip will only last three days, the impact we hope to raise through sponsorship and donations will allow the Lavender Touch to continue to support patients for years to come.\"We will be supported across the Borders by a tour bus which will follow the route and stop off at many towns and villages where the Lavender Touch volunteers will be holding a number of events to promote the charitys work.\"The cyclists head off on Friday, August  and hope to reach Gala Cricket Club before the close of play on until Sunday, August .Local businesses can advertise on the side of tour bus -interested, contact Keith Irvine .Donations can be made to the Over the Hills team at www.lavendertouch project over_the_hill_elite_riders "},{"url":null,"title":"garden-delights-opens-peebles","story":"A NEW community garden in Peebles was officially opened last week.Tesco store manager Tracy Wilson was given the honour of cutting the ribbon at the Gutterbluids Societyrsquos Dovecot Community Garden.A grant from the Tescos Bags for Help scheme along with local donations helped fund the project on land at the junction of Dovecot Road and March Street.Andrew Fraser, secretary of Peebles Gutterbluids Society told us: \"The project would not have been possible without a pound grant received from Tescorsquos Bags of Help Scheme, and the firmrsquos willingness to allow the project to go ahead on their land.\"The pound grant, plus a few generous local donations, paid for the  small, ornamental trees which were required for the garden.\"Tescorsquos local Community Champion, Pauline Weir, was very supportive of the project and was keen that bench-seats should be included in the plans.\"Two bench seats were also donated by local iniduals and have been refurbished, plus two new seats were kindly donated, one by the Rotary Club of Peebles, and the other by private donors.\"Gutterbluids Society members and a few friends planted out the five groves of trees early last December.And each of the saplings was in blossom this spring.As well as its aesthetic appeal the new garden is also benefitting nature.Mr Fraser added: ldquoThe grass in amongst the tree groves has been left deliberately to grow, providing a natural area for pollenating insects, etc, and a surprising number of wild flowers are growing there.\"Our bench-seats are proving popular, - and not only for human use.\"As a result we have had to install lsquopigeon perchesrsquo behind two of the seats, in a bid to stop them perching on the seat backs and defacing them.

The new lights would replace wall-mounted lights and could, residents fear, make a signicant impact on the character of the area.A number of residents have been in contact about this matter as they fear that the introduction of these lights, which are really more suited to an urban setting, are inappropriate to their village.I think it is incumbent on the council to show some regard to their concerns as local people are, rightly, proud of their architectural heritage and do not want to see it compromised by the insensitive implementation of a policy which is not appropriate for their community.I would urge them to look again at this issue.Donald Cameron MSP,"},{"url":null,"title":"letter thank you tarbert","story":"On the Friday, while out walking through the village, my walking assistance buggy went into a pothole causing me to lose balance and fall over.

I#ve been on many a demonstration in my time and this was one of the best.Rolling off the ferry on the Friday evening we were welcomed by a guard-of-honour standing along the pier waving saltires.The townsfolk turned out in droves to welcome us, waving saltires from windows and even stringing saltire bunting across the street at fourth-storey level. I had the romantic impression that the good folk of Campbeltown had been following the ious pro-independence rallies as they worked their way around the geography of Scotland and had just been waiting for their own town#s turn!The sun stayed out for us right until pm. Then the rain suddenly came down and we took down our Pensioners for Independence stall.  That evening Yes Kintyre put on a special party for us all with local musicians in the Argyll Arms Hotel.On Sunday some of us stayed on and explored your beautul peninsula. As the ferry pulled away that evening members of Yes Kintyre stood along the harbour wall holding up saltires to bid us farewell.Thank you all again for a memorable experience.Yours,Mary McCabe,Glasgow.Sir,It was my great privilege to attend yet another Open at Royal Portrush and to witness  year-old Oban golfer Robert MacIntyre finish tied sixth in his very first Major Championship.It was a wonderful performance, and confirmation, of the talent and the temperament we, the journalists, felt sure that he had.  He is now a Euro millionaire, but he remains an open, helpful and cheerful lad with both feet firmly planted on the ground, thanks to a great family and a strong desire to remain in his home town.I was at Glencruitten for the first time in June and soon discovered why Robert wants to go back there on a regular basis after weeks on tour.  It#s a terric club, no airs and graces.  They are very proud of Robert, and rightly so, but I very much doubtthey would allow him to lose his down-to-earth approach to international recognition.Yours,Jock MacVicar, Southend-born Scottishgolf correspondent and long-time Dunaverty member. Sir,Through the columns of your newspaper, may I express my grateful thanks to all the businesses, organisations, and iniduals, who donated to our fundraising, allowing the dancers to compete in the United States Highland Dancing Championships held recently in Las Vegas.We had a very successful trip, placing in both the Highland and choreography events.

The pubs and cafes were busy so it was good for local businesses. Campbeltown is a Yes town and it was brilliant to have all these people come here. Local people were coming off the pavements and joining the procession so it created a good, positive vibe.Pro-Unionists opponents held their own counter demonstation. However, the march went off without any incident and there were no arrests, with only one warning which was drug related.A spit of rain earlier in the day failed to develop into poor weather as the marchers would round the town to hear speakers and listen to musicians at the rally at Kinloch Green.Mr Wilson said he was particuarly pleased at the turnout as there had been some confusion over whether the march would go ahead due to internal sions within the hierachcy of All Under One Banner, which has organised independence marches across the country.Following Mr Singh#s sacking, founder Neil Mackay resigned from his position on its national executive pending an internal investigation.Pro-UK Unionist group A Force For Good met the march on the shore front and say they filmed and counted the marchers, as they have at previous events, and afterwards claimed the turnout was just .Director, Alistair McConnachie, said: #All Under One Banner is basically the marching wing of the SNP. AUOB, and SNP MPs and MSPs, lie about the numbers which attend their marches, sometimes up to  or  times.#Unfortunately, they are not challenged by the Scottish media. The good news is that A Force For Good has a presence at every AUOB march.

Are the faces staring out from the pages of glossy magazines shining with wellbeing  They might be tanned, toned, and expensively exfoliated, butany of these iniduals has a heart full of joy, it is unlikely to be as a result of their lestyle.In a recent talk, Nicola Sturgeon made an appeal to commonsense, stating what, deep down, most of us already know. She claims that when calibrating a countryrsquos standing and success, gross domestic product is not the most accurate measure. Not least among the misleading factors when using GDP as a guide is that its figures ignore unpaid carersrsquo work, yet put a value on illegal drug consumption. Just as worryingly, says Ms Sturgeon, ldquoIt values activity in the short term that boosts the economy eventhat activity is hugely damaging to the sustainability of our planet in the longer term.The First Ministerrsquos laudable aspiration is that ldquothe objective of economic policy should be collective wellbeing ndash how happy and healthy a population is, not just how wealthy a population is. Hoping to establish a fairer and truer scale of assessment, she is collaborating with the prime ministers of New Zealand and Iceland ndash women all, in charge of countries geographically on the fringes, who are prepared to challenge convention.Cynics might, of course, say that Ms Sturgeon is simply laying the groundwork for another independence bid, in which those predicting dire financial consequences will be brushed off as old-fashioned and out of touch by placing too much emphasis on our economic prowess. Yet with Brexit, not just economists but rabid Leavers acknowledge that orce from the EU will cause financial shockwaves. Clearly, this is a risk they think worth running. By the same token, idealists north of the Border, who want us to exit from the UK, often say that the possibility of diminished economic performance after independence would not in itself be a deal breaker. There are bigger issues at stake.That argument is for another day. At this point, were Scotland to become a pioneer in putting a fairer society ahead of a more affluent one, this would represent nothing less than a second enlightenment. The inequalities in health and housing, education and attainment that are nakedly apparent all around us, are shaming for one of the wealthiest countries in the world. No matter how much those at the top make, or how vibrant our financial markets, poverty and desperate hardship for too many people persists. Itrsquos tempting to think that those who see GDP and similar indices as telling the whole story have also embraced the biblical creed that the poor will always be with us ndash in other words, there is nothing we can do about their plight.While the SNP has not been far-sighted or proactive enough to combat the recent shocking rise in drug-related deaths, many of them linked to deprivation and hopelessness, nevertheless Ms Sturgeon and the like-minded leaders with whom she is allied, have a strong social conscience. If the message that money is only part of the equation takes hold, it could potentially prove a turning point for the way all rich societies see, and regulate, themselves.Naturally therersquos a danger when writing disparagingly about high-income earners of appearing either green-eyed or preachy. Despite spending a childhood in the pews, hearing how the widowrsquos mite was as valuable as the millionairersquos cheque, and that those who are hard up today will be blessed with eternal treasures in the hereafter, I nevertheless know that no pair of rose-tinted spectacles can make a terrying bill, an unattainable holiday or too-expensive winter coat, one bit easier to bear. As Mae West put it bluntly: ldquoIrsquove been rich and Irsquove been poor, and rich is better.When it comes to wellbeing, you donrsquot need a carbon monoxide monitor to recognise that the air in Stornoway or St Abbs is far better for us than that in the throbbing financial hearts of Edinburgh or Glasgow, or for that matter Tokyo and New York. Wellbeing consists of something way beyond liquidity, location, or assets. Those in their gated communities, who store their Cartier watches in a vault, have cut themselves off from the rest of society. Is that really enviable  This is not to say they might not be really decent, kind-hearted people who give generously to good causes. Perhaps some of them are. But no matter how open-handed they appear to be, money creates a spiralling gulf between the haves and the have-nots, and sometimes cause rts much closer to home, as family lawyers will attest.Far from solving the problem by capitalistsrsquo pet theory of ldquotrickle-down, too much capital at the top of society actually entrenches inequality. Thus, the endless pursuit of higher incomes, pricier properties, competitive conspicuous consumption, whether at a personal or national level, is intrinsically unhealthy. Once you believe that the GDP graph should show an inexorable year-on-year increase, you become blinkered. This is as true, I suspect, for those running the country as for the inidual.Hunger for amassing hundreds of thousands of pounds, and the power that comes with it, is a recipe for potential disaster. It is psychologically and spiritually corrosive. Slowing the Gradgrind pursuit of ever-greater productivity, focusing on more nourishing and longer-lasting priorities, is a way of calling time on the fallacy that the bottom line is all that matters, and that cash is king. It is a way of taking an ethical stance, and saying enough is enough. How to calculate what constitutes enough, of course ndash be it income, savings, love, leisure, charity, you name it ndash is even harder than measuring happiness.Read more: Scotlands history has lain in the British shadow for too long"},{"url":null,"title":"runrig-scots-band-announce-fan-q-premiere-one-last-dance-farewell-film","story":"It seemed a fitting farewell for the band, long after it all began on the Isles of Skye way back in .

His show Right-Wing Comedian was banned in Australia following allegations of transphobia.WHEN I was growing up near Dumfries, the Tories were demonised, although lots of people voted for them. As I got older, I started to question things and saw that government interference is usually a bad thing. When I won Scottish Comedian of the Year, I did it with a show talking about why Margaret Thatcher was a hero of mine. If somethingrsquos coming from your personal truth, people will see that and find it funny eventhey disagree.My show at the Fringe this year, Transgressive, is about the fact I got banned from a venue in Perth, Australia, after people complained that it was transphobic even though I wrote it with a trans woman I was dating at the time. There was no attempt to look at the material in the show to seeit was offensive ndash just a knee-jerk reaction from the venue. The fact that a white guy was saying it was enough, they assumed it wasnrsquot from my personal experience. It showed their prejudice and discrimination rather than mine. People love to complain and get offended and everybody wants to broadcast on social media that they are a good person.There are some venues that donrsquot book me. One venue has taken a stand and wonrsquot book anyone whorsquos right-wing. I was told by the venue in Perth ldquothis is an inclusive place, you have to leave but how is it inclusive then  So much of it is posturing. Irsquove never seen one of these left-wing headliners demanding their pay is equally distributed among all the acts. Comedy has always pushed against the establishment and the moment the political establishment is right wing but the social establishment ndash the prevailing trends in society ndash is not right wing at all.There are a few shows from comedians on the right at the Fringe this year and I think itrsquos because people in general are sick of cloying, hypocritical, liberal attitudes and all the witch-hunts on Twitter. I think anyone should be subject to a joke and I disagree with the idea that you shouldnrsquot lsquopunch downrsquo with a joke. In my last show, I did jokes about poor people, disabled people and the #metoo victims ndash I made fun of them. Yoursquove got to be able to scrutinise anything. The comedy stage has to remain an unsafe place.Transgressive is at Gilded Balloon Teviot from July  to August .Sarah SouthernA former aide to David Cameron, Sarah Southern has been performing comedy since .I GREW up in a very politically engaged family ndash my dad was a prison visitor and my mum lived a feminist ideal ndash she worked full time, she went back to university when I was about nine, but she would never identy as a feminist. So, for me, I thought only women were allowed to be in charge of things ndash my mum was in charge in my house and Maggie was the Prime Minister. But during the s, there was the fall of the Berlin Wall and I could see the change. I always felt the Conservatives was where I was.The essence of my show is about why, a girl who grew up in the north of England, ended up becoming a Tory and working for the Tories. Itrsquos about me questioning my political identity, which a lot of people are doing at the minute. The Tory party I worked in for eight years is very dferent now and I feel very uncomfortable about universal credit ndash itrsquos appalling the way itrsquos been done. But who  can I vote for  Jeremy Corbynrsquos party doesnrsquot represent me.A lot of comics I worked with didnrsquot know my background as a Conservative and therersquos a couple of gigs I think I havenrsquot been booked for because Irsquom a Tory but I donrsquot let that worry me. Therersquos enough space ndash there are other gigs ndash and I havenrsquot come across any animosity from other performers.Left-wing comedians have dominated comedy and I think that could be because art often fights against the establishment and power. In the s, Spitting Image and comedy like it was perfect for bashing against the Thatcher and Major governments.I think therersquos a trend towards right-leaning comedians now because we are in such interesting times when lots of people are questioning their identity and MPs have left their parties. Brexit has also changed things ndash those who voted Remain are cross that itrsquos still a live issue and those who want to Leave are cross that we havenrsquot left.You have to think hard about right-leaning jokes in terms of people having a preconceived idea. If people think Irsquom a Tory, Irsquove got to make them understand Irsquom not punching down at people ndash thatrsquos not my style. I have to be conscious about the way I say things so they can see Irsquom in the same boat as them ndash Irsquom not from a wealthy family, I didnrsquot go to a fancy school, and when I worked for the Tories, I was one of the only people who hadnrsquot gone to boarding school or Oxford. The likelihood is: we probably think a lot alike, I just happen to vote dferently.Tentatively Tory is at PBHs Free Fringe, Waverley Bar, from August  - Geoff NorcottBorn in South London, Geoff Norcott is a comedian and political commentator who has appeared on Radio , Mock the Week and the recent TV documentary, How the Middle Class Ruined Britain, which looked at the effects of gentrication.LOOKING back, I probably had tendencies to be a conservative quite young. I remember hating getting free school dinners and thinking: why am I depending on this thing called The State  My dad was a Labour man and, although we have dferent politics, therersquos a streak in both of us of hating people having power over us. I ask myself: what is it that makes me think like that  My main guiding instinct is I just hate people telling me what to do. Itrsquos not libertarianism, itrsquos just the government staying out of our lives where possible.A lot of comedy is left-wing because there was a backlash against what was seen as the bigotry of some s comedians but not all the comedy of that era was like that ndash a lot was quite playful and family friendly but itrsquos been struck off the register. There was this sort of inherited victory ndash the feeling that the left won the debate in comedy and that went unquestioned for a long time. But whatrsquos punctured that is the Brexit vote because we discovered that itrsquos possible to be left-wing and vote Leave and a lot of people did and yet when you look at the comedy circuit it seemed like nobody did.Comedy audiences arenrsquot necessarily mostly left-wing though. When you go and gig and do tours around the country, itrsquos quite reassuring to find that the vast majority of people are still grown up, whether theyrsquore left or right, leave or remain. Because of the dialogue that happens on social media, you can be persuaded that everyone has lost their sense of humour but I donrsquot think thatrsquos the case. There is a small percentage of people that are like that or are likely to complain at gigs. Some people have a dferent lens on humour and will make a calculation before they decide they can laugh.I think, for some reason, people think right-wing humour must be mean about the vulnerable, but itrsquos not ndash I take issue with the idea that right-wing comedy has to be implicitly mean. Therersquos maybe less subject matter for jokes, partly because the left arenrsquot currently in power. But once you tap a vein, it can be quite a rich one.One of the things people said about the documentary I made was: how can you, as a Conservative, have compassion for people who are going to lose their homes, but hang on a minute: how does being a Conservative preclude compassion  That idea comes from the self-consoling views on the left that their side inherited all the virtue. The leftrsquos argument would be lsquoletrsquos give you a bigger slice of the same-sized piersquo, whereas my argument would be lsquoletrsquos give you the same-sized slice of a much bigger pie. Letrsquos make a bigger pie everybody.rsquo Therersquos something slightly infantile about the left thinking theyrsquore the good guys like theyrsquore in some sort of Marvel franchise where they are the Avengers and everyone  is Thanos.Geoff Norcott: Work in Progress is at Underbelly, Bristo Square from August -.Dominic FrisbyDominic Frisby is a comedian and writer on financial affairs. His book Le After The State argues that government should be much smaller.I WOULD say comedy is institutionally left-wing and a lot of comedians these days avoid politics altogether because they donrsquot want it to affect their work. Therersquos a comedy club near my house ndash I contacted them and I went down and compered. But I was taken off the roster because I voted Leave. Itrsquos the whole country gone mad ndash people will not give you workyou have the wrong political opinions. Itrsquos become so unacceptable to have views that donrsquot conform to the tyranny of the  BBC axis of liberals.Itrsquos a form of suppression and censorship and it goes back to smearing everyone who doesnrsquot agree with you. It goes back to Ben Elton ndash hersquos a great comic, but his generation, in attacking what came before them, they no-ed an entire generation of comics. Benny Hill for example, who was harmless.There is a trend now, though, towards right-wing comedians and Brexit has been the turning point ndash a lot of comedians have come out of the closet. However, therersquos an authoritarian left and its figureheads are Owen Jones [columnist and commentator] and people like that, who say: you cannot think that, you cannot say that. Itrsquos almost like a religion and anyone who utters thoughts that deviate from it are ex-communicated.Comedy audiences also tend to be a certain way. If you ask an audience, lsquowho voted Leave rsquo, it will be   per cent Remain and those who did vote Leave go quiet. Itrsquos because wersquove had left-wing comedy rammed down our throats so it attracts those people and people who donrsquot think that way keep their mouths shut.Libertarian Love Songs is at PBHs Free Fringe, Banshee Labyrinth, from August  -.Konstatin KisinKonstantin Kisin is a Russian-British comedian and a former student at Edinburgh University who made headlines last year by refusing to sign a university behavioural agreement insisted that all humour must be respectful and kind.MY show is about the fact I turned down the behavioural agreement contract which was offered to me, which is a jumping off point for looking at where we are with freedom of expression and censorship and no-ing. I also contrast it with growing up in the Soviet Union ndash Irsquom starting to feel like wersquore heading in that direction.I was shocked to receive the agreement. If Irsquod felt it was an isolated incident that has nothing to do with whatrsquos going on in broader society, I might not have said anything about it, but I turned it down because itrsquos part of a broader change thatrsquos sweeping through society. Wersquore in a world where we think that words are violence and jokes oppress people and saying the wrong thing triggers someonersquos PTSD or whatever and renders them disabled for le. We are starting to take words far too seriously.The left are now the people peddling ideas that donrsquot stand up to scrutiny and the reason they have to suppress free speech is that is the only way to continue advancing all the things they tell us are true, that Britain is a racist, xenophobic place that hates immigrants, that everyone is oppressed, that wersquore all privileged in dferent ways and this is what determines everything ndash all of this nonsense is being spread by the radical left and the reason they donrsquot want to engage in debate is that any examination of the facts immediately contradicts that. The people who want to suppress freedom of expression are people who know theyrsquore wrong.I think there is a kickback happening and rightly so ndash itrsquos almost like wersquove got to a point where wersquove gone so far in one direction, we almost feel: someone had to say something. But I can count the number of people fighting back against this in the comedy world on one hand. Comedy also reflects culture more broadly ndash universities have become more woke and that is leaking out into society. Comedy only mirrors what happens in society and the reason there are a few comedians challenging this stuff is because the progressive, woke narrative is perceived as the establishment and anyone who disagrees is a heretic.My feelings about free speech are not driven by something I read on the internet ndash they are driven by what happened to my family. My grandfather was arrested and exiled from the Soviet Union in  for saying that the invasion of Afghanistan was wrong ndash it was something that everybody thought but you werenrsquot supposed to say. I know just how important freedom of expression is and when I ask audiencesthey think it is more dangerous to say what they think than it was ten years ago, often more than half the audience say yes and that is not a healthy direction of travel.Orwell That Ends Well is at Gilded Balloon Teviot from July  to August "},{"url":null,"title":"go-go-time-welcome-back-scottish-football","story":"If yoursquore not fond of football, fear not.

Chaps ndash and many women these days too ndash hugging each other with unerotic elan.On very special occasions, you might see grown men struggling, and in many cases failing, to hold back tears . A crucial goal at the football is way more exciting than anything you encounter at the cinema or in books or even at the bingo. Football isnrsquot one of these daft games where the score is counted in hundreds.That said, these days, the game can be as dull and incomprehensible as cricket.

They must set off for the games, patting their pockets and going through a checklist: ldquoMatch ticket, wallet, phone, scarf, hat, napkin for half-time pie, flare. Itrsquos like these hooligans setting off up town on a Saturday night, getting to the door and saying: ldquoOops, almost forgot my samurai sword.I suppose flares are supposed to create a visual spectacle, when all they create is a stink and an obscuring of the pitch.

And, as I imagine all the singing and shouting must put the teams off, it might be betterwe all remained quiet for a change, allowing the players to concentrate and get on with the game.These are just a few of my ideas that you might like to kick skywards or,you prefer, to pass back and forth. ++++ISNrsquoT technology marvellous  Voice at the back: ldquoNaw!

Especially when that  miles is punctuated by getting lost in Edinburgh, inadvertently parking slap-bang in a no-parking zone, rushing out and moving the car to an expensive parking zone and then discovering that when it comes to early afternoons Irsquom the only bagel customer in town.But Irsquove been emailed about this place from a reader and it is apparently the best bagel in Scotland. So here I am. Alone with my -mile bagel. Occasionally punctuating the silence by asking the woman behind the counter interesting questions such as: is it busier in the morning  Answer: yes and wersquore open early. Is it OK to park out there  Answer: I donrsquot know. Do you use any chemicals when making these bagels  Answer: What  No! Itrsquos not that outrageous a question.In the States where they are somewhat obsessed with the art of bagel-making therersquos a school of thought that says the only way to get that perfect bagel crust is to boil the bagel in lye or sodium hydroxide. Who knew Course, this substance is also used in cleaning materials and can be,handled clumsily ndash more than a tad poisonous. Alternatively therersquos simply boiling the dough in water and perhaps a little malt barley. Or, and this is not definitely seen as a good development, simply ditch the boiling and bake instead in a steam-injected oven.In New York where they make a virtue out of a bagel the unique qualities of the famous native version are put down almost entirely to the properties of the local water. If that sounds a little like the Big Applersquos more famous flim-flam then consider this: in the journey from source to tap not only does their water apparently lie in pipes and storage pools for anything from three months to a year but it is, very unusually for the States, soft. Making it produce, apparently, a saltier and sloppier slack-gluten dough, resulting in NY water, so they say, being dubbed the Goldilocks of Water . Again: who knew How is Edinburghrsquos water  Ah, thatrsquos one question I donrsquot get around to asking in here. The internet actually isnrsquot that good at answering either. Seems like its generally labelled soft to moderate, but probe more deeply and it may not be soft at all but something called permanently hard. Ugh.More importantly, perhaps, how is Edinburghrsquos bagel  Or the Bearded Bakerrsquos  On this last subject I do see a man with a beard bustle in and out of a neat and tidy little baking area at the back of this clean little store-front cafe. When I scan a Twitter feed from the Edinburgh Restaurant Awards on my phone it looks like the same guy who was picking up the cafe of the year award. But you know beards. They can be deceptive. So I donrsquot chase after him.Refreshingly perhaps therersquos not a word of the usual self-promoting we-are-the-greatest literature to be seen in here. Therefore, itrsquos simply down to taste.One final point. When it comes to bagels therersquos no greater American insult than to describe one as being simply bread with a hole in it. Is this  Thatrsquos the question on my lips anyway as I heft, and frankly there is a bit of heft to this, my bagel upwards.Itrsquos a shiny brown on the outside, crusted with so many poppy seeds it almost has a blue sheen, itrsquos also unevenly round with the handmade feel that everyone seems to be looking for these days and with a bite it cracks and crunches and yields into a mild chewiness.Is it technically flawless  I dunno. But sliced and filled with pastrami, gruyere, sauerkraut and mustard mayo it satisfies me. Though maybe not enough to warrant another -mile round trip.The Bearded Baker Rodney StreetEdinburgh  Menu: Bagels and doughnuts. I had a cinnamon bun, too, but mainly bagels. All made with that hand-crafted, wholly wholesome touch.  Service: There wasnrsquot anyone  in but me and the service was fine, though they could blow their own trumpet a bit more.  Price: A few pence short of a fiver for a fully-filled, hand-crafted, possibly the best in Scotland, bagel. On their own theyrsquore considerably cheaper.  Atmosphere: Itrsquos all go in the mornings and they open at the crack of dawn, well .am, but way sleepy in the afternoon.

Jeremy Corbyn, or new Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson, would be the beneficiary.Johnsonrsquos October  deadline ndash ldquodo or die ndash is about being able to say to voters at a snap general election that the country has left the EU in such a manner that satisfies the Brexit Party. Johnson would lose hundreds of thousands of votes to the LibDems, for sure, but he clearly believes this depletion would be offset by Farage leaving the pitch.No deal would be disastrous for the country economically, but the Tories could survive electorally by playing a familiar tune. Rising prices and falling living standards would be blamed on obstructionist Brussels. Nationalism always requires a bogeyman and the EU, as ever, would be the fall guy.A more signicant risk from Johnsonrsquos political standpoint would be the effect of no deal on his party in Scotland, and the Union. Leaving the EU without a contract is Ruth Davidsonrsquos worst nightmare. She would be pilloried by Nicola Sturgeon over the economic damage done to Scotland. Davidsonrsquos chances of becoming the next First Minister would fall from % to zero overnight.:Boris Johnson warned over possible resignations after by-election defeatDavidson, who is appalled by the prospect of no deal, is already feeling the pressure internally. A survey of Tory members by Conservative Home, an influential party blog, found that her approval rating was as high as % after the  election. But opposing Johnson has carried a cost. Her rating last week slumped to %.No deal is also likely to fuel support for Scottish independence, an outcome that observers of politics north of the Border may find ironic. It was Alex Salmond who, at the height of the referendum campaign in , suggested that an independent Scotland would refuse to pay its share of the UK debta currency union was turned down. He was flagging up a ldquono deal indy in all but name.Johnson is in a bind. If he fails to secure an acceptable Brexit, his party will implode. If he succeeds, leaving one political union will put another at risk. A no-deal Brexit and the Union look increasingly incompatible. The Prime Ministerrsquos new Cabinet seems more enthusiastic about delivering the former than protecting the latter."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-westminster-leader-calls-cross-party-summit-stop-no-deal-brexit","story":"In his letter to the Westminster party leaders Ian Blackford said: \"Time is short and we must act to prevent the Prime Minister destroying the futures of citizens up and down the country.\"He wrote to Labours Jeremy Corbyn, Plaid Cymrus Liz Saville Roberts, the Liberal Democrats Jo Swinson, Caroline Lucas from the Greens, and Anna Soubry from the Independent Group for Change, calling on them to \"coalesce against a no-deal Brexit\" and the \"unmitigated damage\" it will cause.He warned the risk of leaving the EU without a deal has increased after new Prime Minister Boris Johnson refused to rule it out.Blackfords call for an urgent summer recess meeting follows Chancellor Sajid Javids announcement of an additional pound. billion for no-deal planning.The SNP MP said: \"The past three years of Tory Brexit chaos has pushed Scotland and the UK to the brink, and with Boris Johnson ramping up the rhetoric of a no-deal exit there is a very real risk of being pushed over the clf edge.\"We know that any Brexit - particularly a no-deal Brexit - will cause unmitigated damage to our economy and peoples living standards.\"Time and time again economic analysis has shown that Brexit will be devastating for businesses and public services.

The leaderrsquos colleagues believed Labour was punished for being ambiguous on a second referendum, while parties that were unequivocally in favour of another vote made gains.Leonard, a left winger, was accused after the election of copying the policy adopted by his ally Corbyn, who has not been an enthusiastic supporter of another Brexit vote.Recognising the scale of the defeat, Leonard promised to change his approach and he persuaded his party on June  to back a second vote on any Brexit deal.ldquoI am pleased that Scottish Labourrsquos Executive Committee has endorsed my call for the party to back a confirmatory vote on any Brexit deal with Remain as an option on the ballot paper, he said at the time. ldquoScottish Labour will wholeheartedly campaign for a Remain victory in such a vote.However, although Leonard repeated his support for a second vote  hours later, The Herald on Sunday could find no examples of him repeating this phrase in any press release since that point.In late June, in the context of Boris Johnsonrsquos Tory leadership bid, he hit out at a no-deal Brexit and said Scottish Labour was committed to standing up for the UKrsquos ldquoplace in Europe, but did not mention a referendum.

Sadly, my fears were borne out, and no consensus was found ... With Parliament unable to reach agreement, a confirmatory vote, I believe, is a way to try and break the impasse.ldquoBut with new Prime Minister Boris Johnson looking increasingly set to embrace a no-deal Brexit, the prospects do not look good, as by simply doing nothing he can run down the clock and crash us out of the European Union.A Scottish Labour source said: ldquoWe were told there had been a decisive change in policy following the European election, but so far it appears it was nothing but empty words. There has been no push to explain to the public that wersquore unambiguously a pro-remain party, and MSPs, MPs and activists knocking on doors are getting increasingly frustrated.Liberal Democrat MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton said: ldquoScottish Labour is being punished for its garbled position on Brexit because the public can see straight through their attempt to play both sides.

To call the drug testing programme tokenistic is a wild over-exaggeration. Itrsquos almost non-existent.According to the latest figures for the first three months of this year from UKAD, the anti-doping authority, there were just  Scottish players tested in competition. If the concentration was on the Premiership, which it almost certainly was, then that spanned at least  games involving more than , playerswhich, by my rudimentary maths, means the chance of even being tested was about one in , never mind getting caught.Of course the testing programme is meant to cover all four isions, or  teams, but I doubtthe testers turn up on a wet Wednesday in Brechin, so Irsquove kept the analysis to our top league, otherwise there would be considerably more chance of being hit by lightning than caught out.By contrast, in England a player in the Premier League can expect to be tested four times over the season, in the Championship marginally less. The four English leagues comprise  teams, with Scottish numbers at just under half that. For the quarter in England there were  in-competition tests, so a Scottish equivalent should have been around  ... six times the actual number.The drug authorities stress another key to catching out cheats is out-of-competition testing. In Scotland there were just , in England . But donrsquot imagine that the testers turn up at the door without warning at ungodly hours, as they do in athletics and tennis for instance. No, ours are done at training sessions and there is anecdotal evidence that testersrsquo targets are sometimes leaked in advance.Overall there were  tests carried out and paid for by the English FA in the quarter, , in the year, whereas in Scotland, for the SFA, the comparable totals were , and just . So the FArsquos testing is more than  times the rate of ours.Irsquove heard a range of excuses from the SFA, such as itrsquos too expensive, drugs donrsquot improve footballersrsquo performance and, equally risible, therersquos no evidence of cheating. No excrement Sherlock!I asked UKADthey believed that the SFA was carrying out adequate testing. Interpreting a rather circuitous response from the organisation, itrsquos the case that there is a basic public interest and intelligence-led programme, but the FA provides additional funds for a premium service, whereas it is clear the SFA does not, and this accounts for the yawning disparity.Mascot or mas-notThe place is hoachinrsquo with World Cups.

Take his bizarre, and apparently rambling, answer to a radio interviewer recently when he was asked how he relaxed. He made models of London buses, he replied, from old crates and wine boxes, with painted-on happy people. The assumption was that he was making it up, that he was caught out and was just uttering the first thing that came into his head. But perhaps not.Prior to this anyone going to Google and entering ldquoBoris bus would have been inundated with items about how he promised pound million to the NHS after Brexit, photographed as he stood in front of a red bus with that slogan ldquowe send the EU poundm a week on the side. And his failed attempt to reintroduce the Routemaster bus to London.But after his ldquoconfession, lo and behold, most of the unfavourable stuff had been pushed well down the pecking order by Borisrsquos alleged hobby. Itrsquos called SOE, or search engine optimisation, and itrsquos just the kind of wheeze Dominic Cummings, architect of Vote Leave, would have come up with. He hadnrsquot officially started as Borisrsquos senior adviser then, but there is the phone and email.A million MylesIrsquove been binge-watching Keeping Faith, the second series of which is on BBC. Forget the plot, itrsquos unmissable simply for the actor who plays the lead, Faith, Eve Myles. Her performance is electric, mesmerising, utterly convincing, with the complete emotional range, from joy ndash although therersquos not a lot of it ndash to sadness, anger and boredom, therersquos even a dash of fisticuffs from her as well. Myles is a boxing fan, and displays great technique, but she gave up participating when she broke a knuckle punching a wet sandbag, rather than an errant husband. I canrsquot remember seeing such a brave and bravura turn from an actress in, well, ever.Credit, too, to the producer, director and co-writer Pip Broughton for the casting, everyone in the show is top notch. She comes from a theatre background and in the series uses lots of close-ups of the charactersrsquo faces and emotions, so therersquos not much room for wooden acting. What is also unusual is that children in it arenrsquot just props, passed off to suit the plot, but central to Faithrsquos le, so family is at the heart, and heartache, of it. The show is scripted, but there are no rehearsals, with the actors pitched straight in to capture spontaneity.I looked up the -year-oldrsquos CV, shersquos been in Doctor Who and Torchwood ndash but which actor hasnrsquot  ndash but in productions mainly down the cast order. Not anymore. A couple of caveats. The villain has had a head transplant between series.

It wasnrsquot asthe dangers of radioactivity werenrsquot known, but after the sicknesses and cancers emerged in those who had witnessed, close-up, the atomic bomb tests in the , use of the Pedoscope was banned. Today we may have warped feet but at least we donrsquot rattle.It was Marie Curie and her husband Pierre who coined the word ldquoradioactive. Marie was quite cavalier about handling the sources, stuffing bottles of polonium and radium into her coats and jackets. If you want to see her papers ndash even her cookbooks ndash at Frances Bibliotheque National you have to get into moon suit and sign a waiver before you can open the lead lined boxes storing them. In  Pierre tied a chunk of radium to his arm and, noting the resultant burn, concluded he had discovered a cure for cancer.Manufactures then stuffed their products with radioactive thorium and advertised the supposed health benefits. Radium bath salts claimed to treat insomnia. Pots and jugs lined with radon and uranium were prescribed for flatulence.Of course, we donrsquot believe this nonsense nowadays. Well, not quite. Thousands of people each year, from around the world, travel to four former uranium mines in Montana to pay to sit in radioactive mine shafts, believing that being exposed to radon gas can cure their ailments, or at least mitigate pain. The theory is that exposure to low-dose radiation, while it damages cells, prompts compensatory processes that stimulate repair, decrease free radicals, and activate proteins that prevent inflammation. No, I donrsquot know what that means either.In the centre of it all is Butte, Montana ndash with its wonderfully-named bar called Pisserrsquos ndash a town of , people built on a honeycomb of old copper mines, and probably the most radioactive populated place in world, with radon gas leaking into homes. Many of the old houses are built from bricks made from phosphate slag, large portions of the town are paved with it.

So herersquos a question for your next pub quiz. What do Russian president Vladimir Putin and Teodoro Obiang Nguema, president of Equatorial Guinea, have in common Well, to begin with, excluding monarchs, they are both among some of the world leaders who have held power the longest.This weekend, -year-old president Obiang will have been in power for a staggering  years, a record time for any sitting president in the world.You have to go all the way back to August , , to mark the day that Obiang overthrew his uncle, the dictator Francisco Macias Nguema, who was shot two months later. In the intervening decades, Obiang claims to have foiled at least  coups or assassinations against him, all the time accusing the countryrsquos army, political opposition or foreign powers.In that same period, Obiangrsquos rule of Equatorial Guinea has often been cited by human rights groups such as Amnesty International as one where repressive measures including torture, extra-judicial executions, arbitrary arrests, and the persecution of political activists and human rights defenders is commonplace.Oil-rich Equatorial Guinea is also one of the most corrupt countries in the world, a place where Obiangrsquos cohorts in power have a penchant for investing in luxury private mansions in Europe rather than helping rid the country of its widespread poverty.By comparison to Obiang, as world leaders go, Putin is a new kid on the block, evenhis time in the Kremlin is fast approaching  years. Yes, it really has been that long since the steely president stepped into the Kremlin and the world sat up and took notice.Earlier this year, after almost three decades in power, an autocratic neighbour of Putin, Kazakhstanrsquos president Nursultan Nazarbayev, himself one of the last political survivors of the former Soviet Union, finally resigned, effectively taking him off what has sometimes in derisory terms been dubbed the ldquoleaders for le list.Following the stepping down of Nazarbayev, and with Algerian president Abdelaziz Bouteflikarsquos decision to end his re-election bid and the fall of Sudanrsquos Omar al-Bashir in the face of mass protests, perhaps now is as good a time as any to examine just what it is that helps keep such leaders in power for so long.Currently, according to the independent watchdog organisation Freedom House, which monitors freedom and democracy around the world, the  or so longest-serving leaders in the world all represent countries considered ldquonot free by the organisationrsquos criteria.The fact the first  of these leaders are also men speaks volumes about the ways in which global political structures remain weighted.Indeed, itrsquos not until number  on the list that one comes across what is deemed a ldquofree country, or indeed a female leader, in this case Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.In an arena where political power is slippery and can vanish with one wrong move, what is it that helps keep the longest-serving leaders in place ldquoAt the very essence of it is the hunger for continued power, says Anneke Van Woudenberg, who as a former director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watchspent years monitoring and researching the role of many leaders on a continent home to half of the  longest-serving leaders and five of the top seven.But as well as the human desire for authority and prestige, Van Woudenberg points to other purely practical factors at play in preventing many leaders, especially in Africa, from standing down willingly or gracefully.ldquoRetiring as a head of state in Africa doesnrsquot usually come with a lot of benefits, Van Woudenberg, who is now executive editor of the organisation Rights and Accountability in Development, told Newsweek.ldquoVery few African countries ndash in fact almost none ndash have any kind of pension or security scheme for former presidents or heads of state. So out of power means out of money.In Africarsquos case, ever since the turn of the st century the trend of entrenched leadership had spread across the region. In its wake it often spurred corruption, instability, social ision and economic stagnation. While that trend might now show signs of reversing, it persisted for a iety of reasons.As a recent study by the US-based international affairs think tank the Council on Foreign Relationsconcluded, many of Africarsquos leaders increasingly secured longer terms through ldquoconstitutional coups, proposing amendments for approval by the legislature or judiciary, or in national referendums, that allowed for additional terms in office.Around the year , when many post-colonial leaders were nearing the ends of their constitutional term limits, this pattern became more distinct. Since then, says CFR,  heads of state have tried to remain in power by adjusting their countriesrsquo constitutions.Among them was Namibian president Sam Nujoma in , followed by Gnassingbe Eyadema, the president of Togo, in . One year later, the Gabonese parliament voted to remove term limits from its constitution, allowing president Omar Bongo to run for a sixth term.This quickly became regular practice every few years in African nations as widespread as Angola, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea, Niger, Nigeria, the Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Senegal, Sudan and Uganda.Another reason for Africarsquos recurring third-term problem is the lack of effective political opposition in many countries, say analysts.ldquoThe opposition to these constitutional changes comes from inside, says Phil Clark, lecturer in comparative international politics at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London.ldquoIt tends to come from domestic oppositions, rather than the African Union or regional powers or international donors.Clark goes on to cite Rwanda as one example, which, although widely considered a one-party state, has several opposition parties, though none offers a credible challenge to current president Paul Kagamersquos Rwandan Patriotic Front .Should some opposition parties ever pose a threat to the status quo, many African governments and leaders think nothing of quashing their challengers. In the past, military coups were common as a means to seize power, with both Equatorial Guinearsquos president Obiang and his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni entering their presidencies this way.In all, in Africa, there were  successful coups from  to , but only  from  to , and just the one ndash against Zimbabwersquos Robert Mugabe ndash since then, according to CFR analysis.It would be very wrong to single out Africa as the sole region where the rulers of countries have held on to power for long periods through nefarious or authoritarian means.From Latin America to Europe and the Middle East to Asia, there are many examples of those who qualy in the leaders-for-le stakes. At their disposal is a ied bag of political strategies and tricks.A small number of rulers stays in office, of course, simply by ignoring the letter or spirit of the law. Some veteran leaders, as Freedom House points out, simply reset the clock, evading time limits by arguing that the restrictions in new constitutions do not apply retroactively. Others use what has been called a ldquolegislative assist, among them Kazakhstanrsquos president Nazarbayev, who as far back as  used a loyalist legislature to push through constitutional amendments that exempted him ndash and only him, as the first president of independent Kazakhstan ndash from a two-term limit.Freedom House says other aspiring leaders-for-le have turned to referendums ndash riggednecessary ndash to extend their rule. The options are surprisingly ied, which brings us back to Putin.While it may seem a long way off, whether Putin retains power after , when his current term ends, is the key question of Russian politics today. The outcome will also have a major influence in shaping international affairs and policies.As Leonid Bershidsky, columnist with the media company Bloomberg, recently pointed out, constitutional limits in Russia ndash just as in parts of Africa ndash are not what they are in other places. In effect, the Kremlin controls the Russian parliament to an extent that makes it possible to change the constitution at any moment, making Putin president for le.ldquoThat lsquonuclear optionrsquo, however, is anathema to Putin, who, despite persistent election rigging in his favour, insists on democratic legitimacy as the basis for his rule, explained Bershidsky in an article last month.Like many Russia watchers, Bershidsky is intrigued by how none of the relatively legitimate scenarios for keeping Putin in power past  look comfortable to the Russian leader.The pressure on Putin has lately been compounded by increasing protests on the streets of Moscow challenging the government over the rejection of independent candidatesrsquo applications for the cityrsquos council elections.The Moscow protests are part of a trend of local demonstrations showing a growing defiant stance against Putinrsquos managed democracy.One Russian media outlet has even reported that the Kremlin believed the protests were being backed by foreign influences intent on starting a ldquocolour revolution, a reference to protests that have overturned governments in other post-Soviet republics.Even as Putin runs out of palatable options for prolonging his reign beyond the constitutional limits, Russian democrats know not to get their hopes up as he undoubtedly remains in charge.That said, as a New York Times editorial pointed out last week, leaders of post-Soviet states have typically lost their grip on power by making one of two big mistakes.The first is brazen manipulation of elections the second is official impunity ndash above all, brutality by law-enforcement agencies.ldquoFew things make people quite so mad, observed the NYT. ldquoThe so-called Rose Revolution in Georgia in , Orange Revolution in Ukraine in , and Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan in  were all touched off by phony vote counts and other electoral fraud.Faced with such challenges to his ldquosoft dictatorship and desire to stay in power, Putin has only a few options. One might be to push for Russiarsquos merger with neighbouring Belarus.Such a manoeuvre would make it possible for Putin to head up the unied country.According to Bloomberg analysts, another would be for Putin to do what he did in , letting a dependable ally, Dmitry Medvedev, run for president and staying on as prime minister to sit out a presidential term as required by the constitution.But Putin these days has perhaps fewer people in the Kremlinrsquos inner circle that he can trust, unlike back then.Around the world, of course, not all leaders resort to unscrupulous or ruthless methods for their longevity.As Freedom House observes, ldquoin some cases, these rulers have earned their long tenures through relatively free elections and remained within constitutional bounds. In the vast majority, however, a single leader has stayed in power by abusing, weakening or completely overriding key democratic institutions.In many cases their long reigns begin to resemble those of kings and sultans. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, once described as the ldquoinventor of st-century populism, is a case in point.Yesterday, president Nguema of Equatorial Guinea marked  years in power. Evenhe should stand down, itrsquos said he has already been grooming his -year-old son Teodorin and his vice-president to take over the top job of the small oil state in central Africa.Certain leaders, it appears, find it near impossible to relinquish power completely. It was another African long-time ruler, former president Yahya Jammeh of the Gambia, who once declared he would rule for ldquoone billion yearsGod wills it, and that only God can set term limits. Some are only too willing to endorse that view.Worldrsquos longest-serving leadersApart from monarchs, who are usually installed for le, here are the leaders who have ruled for the longest:Leading the pack is Cubarsquos revolutionary hero Fidel Castro, with  years in power. When he handed over in , ill and aged in his early s, it was to his brother Raul.Taiwanrsquos first president Chiang Kai-shek was in charge on the island and in mainland China for  years until his death in .North Korearsquos founder Kim Il-sung ran the reclusive state for  years before dying in office in , remaining revered as the ldquoeternal leader.Muammar Mohammed Gaddafi ruled Libya with an iron fist for almost  years before being ousted and then slaughtered in  by rebels at the height of the Arab Spring uprisings.Omar Bongo Ondimba governed oil-rich Gabon for more than  years until his death from cancer in .Albaniarsquos communist dictator Enver Hoxha was in power for  years until his death in .Still adding up their time at the top are:Cameroonrsquos president Paul Biya at  yearsCongo-Brazzavillersquos Denis Sassou Nguesso at  years, excluding a five-year pause after he lost a  electionCambodian prime minister Hun Sen,  yearsUgandarsquos president Yoweri Museveni,  yearsIranrsquos Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has been supreme leader since the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in  years and counting:Chadrsquos Idriss Deby Itno,  yearsTajikistanrsquos Emomali Rahmon,  yearsEritrearsquos Isaias Afwerki,  yearsBelarus Alexander Lukashenko,  yearsDjiboutirsquos Ismail Omar Guelleh,  yearsGabonrsquos Ali Bongo who will have been in power for  years in October "},{"url":null,"title":"whaley-bridge-prepares-downpours-work-continues-fix-dam","story":"Dozens more homes have been evacuated in Whaley Bridgeahead of expected bad weather on Sunday, as emergency workers continue their efforts toprevent the dam giving way.There remains athreat to le in the town and  further properties were cleared in theHorwich End area this weekend, on top of around ,residents who had already been evacuated.Water levels at the Toddbrook Reservoir in the town have been reduced by . metres since Thursday, the Department for the Environment said, but police warned the -year-old structure remained in a ldquocritical condition with a breach still a ldquovery real threat.:Dam still critical but Whaley Bridge residents allowed home to collect essentialsForecasters warned of the potential for up to mm of rain to fall in just an hour or two on Sunday afternoon.Speaking about the prospect of the evacuated people moving back in, he told BBC Breakfast: ldquoAt the rate we are pumping, we are hoping certainly towards the end of the week we be in a position to be able to do that.A Met Office yellow weather warning is in place for much of northern England and the Midlands, including the area around the reservoir.Meteorologist Mark Wilson said: ldquoThere is the potential for some thundery showers which could give some very unwelcome rain .ldquoThere is the potential for -mm in just one to two hours.Police said the added evacuations on Saturday evening were due to ldquoa potential increase in risk of adverse weather in coming days and the ongoing risk of the Toddbrook Reservoir breaching.A map of houses that have been evacuated from the Horwich End area of #WhaleyBridge has been produced: pic YczPVfIKmdash Derbyshire PoliceAugust , Residents evacuated on Thursday told how they grabbed medication and beloved pets when they were allowed to very brieflyhome on Saturday, having been warned by police they did so at their own risk.Reminding residents they should onlyfor essential items, Chief Superintendent Michelle Shooter said:ldquoI would like to take this opportunity to remind local residents that the state of the dam is still in a critical condition and that the risk of breach is still a very real threat.Joan Pass, , was in tears after she went back for the first time since the mass evacuation of the town, describing it as ldquoterrible.:Whaley Bridge reservoir dam feared to be near collapse facing lsquocriticalrsquo momentShe said she thought there had been an explosion when first told to evacuate.Mrs Pass said: ldquoThe bells were ringing ndash I didnrsquot know what the bells were ringing for.

Now, the environmental body hopes that this will be reduced by Scotland’s forthcoming depositscheme.Under the scheme, shoppers will pay a p deposit when buying drinks purchased in single-use plastic or glass bottles and aluminium or steel cans. People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling. The aim of that p will be to give people an extra incentive to recycle their empty bottles and cans, and make people think twice about dropping them.#Our new figures reveal how Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme could visibly slash the number of littered plastic bottles in the Orkney Islands,# said Zero Waste Scotland#s chief operating officer, Jill Farrell.#We all hate seeing empty bottles and cans littering our streets, green spaces and beaches. The great thing about Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme is it will give people a p incentive to do the right thing with their empty bottles — take them back for recycling, rather than risk them ending up on our streets or in our rivers.#Litter isn’t just an eyesore — it also pollutes our environment and seas. And for every bottle littered, more plastic has to be created, generating more planet-damaging emissions. When you take back your empty bottles to be recycled, you’ll not just be getting your p back — you’ll be doing your bit in the fight against the climate emergency.#Further figures from Zero Waste Scotland also show that Orkney goes through an estimated . million plastic bottles every year. An estimated , plastic bottles are littered in the county each year. With a p incentive not to throw away your empties, Zero Waste Scotland anticipates a  per cent reduction in litter for the materials included in the scheme. This would mean , fewer plastic bottles dropped in Orkney Islands each year.With plastic bottles only one of the materials included in the scheme, the overall impact on litter is expected to be even higher. Steel and aluminium cans, glass bottles will also be part of the scheme. The Scottish Government is expected to introduce legislation to enable the scheme later this year.

Orkney’s MSP highlighted the government’s continued failure to find a solution to the islands’ internal ferry services, including replacement vessels, and the lack of progress on implementing RET on external services, a year on from the promised start date. Mr McArthur said: “The National Islands Plan will be important in mapping out the areas where improvements are needed to secure a vibrant future for our island communities.“During the passage of the legislation, I moved amendments making clear that one of the most urgent priorities would be delivering changes and improvements to leline ferry services to meet the needs of people and businesses in Orkney.“This seems to be the message that is coming through loud and clear in the consultation, as demonstrated by the recent response from the NFUS.  It will come as a surprise to no one but should act as a clear signal to ministers that the continued failure to act is unacceptable.“We need a sustainable and long term solution to the funding and operation of our internal ferry services, on which some of our most fragile communities rely. This includes replacement vessels for a fleet that is ageing and no longer fit for purpose.“In addition, more than a year on from the date on which RET was supposed to be introduced, we seem no nearer seeing the reduction in fares. Those using these services are therefore continuing to pay over the odds. That is not good enough.“Having initiated the consultation, the government now have an obligation to act.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Sadly, many are under threat from coastal erosion and the effects of climate change.“SCHARP is doing brilliant work engaging communities with this issue and working to identy and protect sites across Scotland, including a number here in Orkney.  Without the work of volunteers, however, this would simply not be possible. Those who get involved, devoting their time, energy and local knowledge, are due an enormous debt of gratitude.“For example, volunteers in Sanday helped to move and rebuild eroding structures from the Meur Burnt Mound to the local heritage centre, preserving an important cultural and historical attraction. This is just one example of the invaluable work carried out by volunteers that will allow current and future generations a better understanding of their heritage.“I know there is similar great work being undertaken in communities across Scotland and I’ve written to my MSP colleagues encouraging them to find out more about what is happening in their constituencies and regions.

Shetland football...The full story of Orkney v. Shetland football matches for the Milne Cup dating back to Jockie WoodThe full story of Orkney v. Shetland football matches for the Milne Cup dating back to Jockie Wood£ . tax incl.One Hundred Glorious Games is the title chosen to describe the milestone just reached in the annual football fixture between teams representing Orkney and Shetland. But how can those words be justied Well, the first bit is easy. We have just witnessed the th match in the series and from an Orkney point of view the game and outcome were ‘glorious’. But they haven’t all been like that. Amidst many dazzling encounters there have been some dull, tepid affairs which have failed to raise the pulse rate for supporters of either hue.Ah, but that’s all right. Teams are allowed the odd blip or series of blips, safe in the knowledge that the deep sense of history and tradition built up over a long period of time will cover it. No lasting damage will be done to something so enduring as the annual Milne Cup fixture which is ingrained into the culture of the Northern Isles. It is a game like no other and to play in it represents the pinnacle of most players’ footballing ambitions.So, look at it like this. Despite what those from other sporting disciplines might say, football is the ‘glorious game.’ Orkney versus Shetland is our own ‘glorious game.’ And we have just reached number one hundred. Straightforward really!Now, feel free to open the covers and follow the story . . . so far. Experience the ups and downs, intrigue and controversy of more than a century of inter-county football. And make up your own mind about the glorious bits!Jockie WoodNo customer reviews for the moment.* Required fields"},{"url":null,"title":"terms of service  \n","story":"Terms of ServiceLast Updated:   These terms of serviceapply to your access and use of our apps and websites.

The goodwill for such agreements was there, she added.It is easy to see the appeal of such agreements for those voters who believe that Brexit – especially the no-deal iety now envisaged by the Prime Minister – represents a catastrophic act of self-harm. If Swinson and the leaders of other avowedly anti-Brexit parties could reach agreements in key constituencies across the UK to stand only the candidate with the greatest chance of winning then, surely, the chances of the Johnson project being stopped in its tracks would be greatly enhanced.There are just one or two small hurdles in the way…The first of these is the fact that, although speculation runs feverishly, Johnson has not yet called a general election.It’s certainly true that many Conservative Party MPs would like the new PM to capitalise on a boost in the polls to try to increase their numbers at Westminster, but others believe this might be a risky strategy. If Nigel Farage’s Brexit Partysplits the right-wing Eurosceptic vote, then a snap election could bring the Johnson premiership to a sudden end.But let us imagine that Johnson goes down the general election route before the current Brexit deadline of  October and that Swinson sets about trying to build an anti-Brexit coalition. She might have been able to persuade Plaid and the Greens to step aside in a single by-election, but would these parties really be so keen to lay down their electoral chances across the country  Would they risk, by seeing their overall votes in a general election diminish severely, becoming less politically relevant And what about the SNP, every bit as opposed to Brexit as the Lib Dems  There are fewer seats in Scotland where anti-Brexit parties risk splitting the vote than there are in England, but one of them – East Dunbartonshire – is Swinson’s own.Swinson served as MP for that constituency between - and was then defeated by the SNP’s John Nicolson. She took the seat back in , largely, I suspect because of Nicolson’s unpopularity. But with a more impressive candidate, the SNP would surely have a fighting chance of snatching it back. The removal of the leader of the Liberal Democrats from the House of Commons would represent quite a scalp for the nationalists. Can you imagine Nicola Sturgeon passing up the opportunity to see off Swinson  I can’t. And nor would I blame the SNP leader for committing signicant resources to bringing down Swinson. Politics is a contact sport and Swinson is a major target. The suggestion from her that the SNP should give her a clear run at the seat would, rightly, be met with derision.Jo Swinson is not the only party leader now talking about pacts. Brexit Party leader Farage has raised the prospect of deals with the Conservatives, particularly in the north of England, to ensure the election of Eurosceptic MPs.Given the result of the  referendum, any such agreements would surely guarantee the evisceration of any anti-Brexit candidates in those areas.Yes, electoral pacts might be made to work for pro-EU parties but they could just as easily be the secret of Brexiteer success.Those now clamouring for agreements to be struck between the Lib Dems and other parties which take the same position on EU membership should, I think, be careful that they are not wishing for the creation of two-horse races in key constituencies across the country. That scenario would risk strengthening rather than weakening the Brexiteers’ squad at Westminster.Johnson is supported by a team in government that is fully committed to Brexit by  October at any cost. The PM will gladly sacrice the best interests of the UK economy to protect himself.This being so, and with Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour still embarrassingly weak on the matter of Brexit, the idea that the Johnson project might be stopped is an appealing one to those of us who would dearly like to see Brexit cancelled at this late stage.But I fear that any plan to run a single anti-Brexit candidate in a constituency would be met with a plan to run a single pro-Brexit candidate. Jiggery-pokery would be fought with jiggery-pokery.It is abundantly clear that Brexiteers won the  referendum with a campaign strewn with lies. Their promises of an effortless, painless departure from the EU have long since been exposed.But rather than turning against campaign leaders, pro-Brexit voters appear to be hardening their positions and cheering on a damaging no-deal departure.It may now be obvious that Brexit is going to be dficult to deliver. But stopping it will be harder still.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"ian blackford we need cross party summit to stop no deal brexit","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The SNPs Westminster leader has urged his counterparts in the opposition parties to join him in a cross-party summit to stop a no-deal Brexit.In his letter to the Westminster party leaders, Ian Blackford said: \"Time is short and we must act to prevent the Prime Minister destroying the futures of citizens up and down the country.\"He wrote to Labours Jeremy Corbyn, Plaid Cymrus Liz Saville Roberts, the Liberal Democrats Jo Swinson, Caroline Lucas from the Greens and Anna Soubry from the IndependentGroup for Change, calling on them to \"coalesce against a no-deal Brexit\" and the \"unmitigated damage\" it will cause.He warned the risk of leaving the EU without a deal has increased after new Prime Minister Boris Johnson refused to rule it out.Mr Blackfords call for an urgent summer recess meeting follows Chancellor Sajid Javids announcement of an additional £. billion for no-deal planning.The SNP MP said: \"The past three years of Tory Brexit chaos has pushed Scotland and the UK to the brink, and with Boris Johnson ramping up the rhetoric of a no-deal exit there is a very real risk of being pushed over the clf edge. - Horror as  killed and  injured in shooting at busy American shopping centre \"We know that any Brexit - particularly a no-deal Brexit - will cause unmitigated damage to our economy and peoples living standards.\"Time and time again economic analysis has shown that Brexit will be devastating for businesses and public services. The evidence has shown the economic madness of Brexit.\"Rather than acting to prevent such an outcome, the Tory Prime Minister has instead chosen to push ahead by wasting billions of pounds of taxpayers cash on an entirely avoidable policy - at the same time as public services are still bearing the pain of Tory austerity.\"Mr Blackford highlighted Scottish Government analysis suggesting leaving without a deal will cost Scots the equivalent of £, each in reduced GDP and independent economic research forecasting , Scottish jobs being lost in this scenario.He added: \"This cannot go on. I have written to the Westminster party leaders of Labour, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, Greens and the Independent Group for Change, calling for a cross-party summit over summer recess to prevent the Prime Minister destroying the livelihoods of citizens across the UK, and move forward with efforts to take no-deal off the table.\"A UK Government spokeswoman said: \"The UK will be leaving the EU on October , delivering on the vote of the British people.

Earlier this year, the new Leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, refused to comment on reports that the investment fund which he owns at least  per cent of had shared profits of £m over the past two years among its  members.None of the new Scotland Office ministers has any regular outside income recorded on their register of interests.However, analysis carried out by Scotland on Sunday comparing parliamentary records with accounts published by Companies House found that last year, both were eligible for payments running into tens of thousands of pounds – potentially matching their salaries as MPs and ministers.Neither David Mundell, former secretary of state for Scotland, nor under secretary Ian Duncan had declared any shareholdings at the time of their departures.Shadow secretary of state for Scotland Lesley Laird said: “Trust in politicians, governments and the wider political process is, arguably, at an all-time low, and these revelations will do nothing to change that.“Alister Jack and Colin Clark appear to be raking in far more cash from their private holdings alone than most people in Scotland earn.“Many people in Scotland will think there’s simply no way that compares to their own daily experience after almost a decade of Tory austerity.“This will obviously raise questions about the need to address the current lack of clarity on outside earnings.”And the SNP’s Scotland Office spokesperson Tommy Sheppard MP said: “It is clear the Scotland Office is not in touch with the ordinary Scot, nor does the department have Scotland’s best interests at heart, as the Tories continue to sideline Scotland’s needs.”But a UK government source hit back, saying: “The people who are really out of touch with the majority of Scots are the SNP and Labour.“It’s ridiculous to suggest business experience is a bad thing. Most people see it as an advantage to have people in parliament with an understanding of business and experience of le beyond politics. The important thing is they declare their interests in accordance with the rules.”Drawing attention to SNP MP Ian Blackford’s paid roles as chairman of two companies, the source added: “Politicians on all sides with a business background, such as the SNP leader in the Commons, would surely not disagree with that.”The latest company accounts indicate that in , Jack was paid a idend of £, by Edinburgh Self Storage Ltd. He continues to own up to  per cent of shares in the company. Accounts indicate the same sum was paid as a idend in .As a cabinet minister, the Scottish Secretary is expected to earn a salary of £, per year.Jack resigned as a director of Edinburgh Self Storage on  June, , shortly before the general election, and was replaced on the same day by his we Ann, who is described in Companies House records as an “interior designer”. She remains one of three directors of the company, who according to the accounts were entitled to pay totalling £, in , as well as a share of company contributions to a defined pension scheme totalling £,.On  June, , Ann Jack also replaced her husband as one of four directors of Mollin HEP Ltd, a company set up to manage the sale of renewable electricity generated on the family farm. The latest set of accounts indicate that Mollin HEP paid idends totalling £, to directors.Clark, who was named the parliamentary undersecretary of state at the Scotland Office, owns at least three quarters of the shares in Nessgro Ltd, an agricultural produce marketing company.His register of interests states that his position as one of two directors of the company is unpaid. However, the company’s latest annual accounts report that idends of £, were payable in the year ending  May, .Clark is also a member of a number of limited liability partnerships that manage investments including property holdings.According to the latest set of accounts, one of the companies, Maven CapitalLLP – which manages a Travelodge hotel in Wales – generated profits of £, which were available for distribution among  active members.Another company, Maven CapitalLLP – which manages a Georgian office block in Glasgow – reported profits of £,, in its latest set of accounts, for distribution among its  active members. It is not possible to determine Clark’s share of any payout. However, an equal share of the profits from both companies would total well over £, – nearly matching Clark’s salary as an MP.A UK government spokesperson said: “We do not recognise these figures.“Our ministers are clear that their financial interests are wholly and properly declared according to the rules, which are designed to ensure transparency and protect standards in public le.“Mr Jack and Mr Clark have set up businesses which employ hundreds of people across Scotland and the UK. They understand how important it is to support businesses and industry in Scotland, to keep people in jobs and contribute to our economic growth.”The spokesperson added: “When Mr Jack became an MP he stepped back from a number of business interests to allow him to concentrate on parliamentary matters. Some of these were roles in private family businesses, which were taken over by his we. There is nothing improper in this.”The register of interests does record details the extensive property and shareholdings owned by Mr Jack and Mr Clark, who both enjoyed successful business careers before entering parliament in .On his Dumfries and Galloway estate, Mr Jack has declared agricultural land, two cottages and a salmon fishery. Mr Clark’s register of interests includes his house in Inverurie, which he co-owns with his we, and a farm with agricultural land in Aberdeenshire which includes three cottages that are rented out.Both men have also declared signicant shareholdings beyond those that have paid idends in recent years: Mr Jack’s register of interests includes six companies where he holds at least  per cent of share capital, and another seven shareholdings valued at over £,.

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re. So the estimated £ million that the HebCelt generates is more than welcome, as well as providing a brief respite from reality and a sense of something major happening on the doorstep. But just like the visit of old friends tends to be too brief, so there is already a longing for next July."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2465-Raasay.jpg","title":"recruitment drive to restore nursing cover for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe move, which is part of the recommendations outlined bySir Lewis Ritchie in his out of hour health care report for Skye, Lochalsh andSouth West Ross, intends to end a period of four years in which the island hasbeen without an overnight nursing presence.In its advert, NHS Highland states: “Professor Sir LewisRitchie#s Report of May  into out of hours care in Skye, Raasay and SouthWest Ross has enabled a move towards innovative healthcare here when he saw theneed for equity of access to services even where numbers are relatively small…“Raasay offers a rare opportunity to provide cradle to gravepersonal nursing and primary care with continuity while working as part of amutually supportive team.”The chosen applicants will have a “considerable degree ofautonomy” and would liaise with “colleagues and line manager based in NorthSkye and with access to support from GPs in Portree and Rural Practitioners inMacKinnon Memorial Hospital, Broadford when required.”The band six positions at a salary scale of £, # £, per annum are permanent with both full-time and part-time hours available."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LOCHCARRON-GAMES-1-adj.jpg","title":"number 41 in the sun for lochcarron highland","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.Sinclair Patience of Tain and Angus Davren of Conon Bridge excelled at the st edition of the games as they wrote their names into the record books.Angus Davren hit new heights as he cleared . metres to set a new ground record in the high jump.

The results are projects which genuinely improve the lives of today#s residents # as well as visitors # and leave a legacy for future generations. What is even more remarkable is the fact these projects are achieved with very little access to loans. The good work of the community trusts is achieved through dogged determination to raise funds within the community combined with seriously clever navigation of the minefield of grant applications. By steadily securing the funds from a myriad public pots and local activities the trusts ensure each project is not only affordable now, but sustainable for generations to come.In Staffin # home to the iconic Old Man of Storr # the local community trust has raised over £, to upgrade existing footpaths and create new ones. There will be new parking, #welcome# structures and interpretation boards at all sites. The whole project will result in what the trust is calling #Skye Ecomuseum# which will encourage visitors to spend more time and therefore more money in Staffin.In the north west of Skye, the Glendale Trust covers a huge area that attracts , visitors a year # many travelling the long and winding single track road to the top five hotspot of Neist Point.The trust, under the leadership of Tim Hunter-Davies and three new directors, is working hard to develop sustainable facilities for the community and tourists. They have taken ownership of Meanish Pier and the foreshore, creating opportunities for local residents and regional businesses alike. It will be run commercially and provide income to enable the Trust to invest in further sustainable community projects.Glendale # which was the subject of Scotland#s first community buyout back in  # is rich in history and the trust is also looking to develop projects that preserve and share the story of the area, as Tim Hunter-Davies explains: #As well as being instrumental in land reform in the last century, Glendale has a rich heritage stretching back through the centuries. A steamer used to sail daily from Loch Dunvegan and was used as a point to transport many people away from Scotland during the Highland clearances. We want to preserve and share our history with the community and visitors.#In south Skye is the Sleat Community Trust. It has been working hard to provide and improve leline services for the community that also benefit visitors arriving and leaving Skye on the Armadale Mallaig ferry.The SCT currently provides shop, post office and fuel services in two buildings no longer fit for purpose. Over £, has been raised from public and private sources to build a new shop with a community #social# space and offices for the employees of the Trust. They hope to open the new shop in early summer .In addition, the purchase by the Trust of the -hectare Tormore Forest in  continues to create additional sources of income, including selling housing plots as well as an attraction for the community and visitors alike. As trust business development manager Mike Shucksmith explains, the success is based on a combination of commercial and voluntary activity.He said: #To maintain the forest, we have to generate income so we sell split logs to the community, create woodchip for biomass boilers and are developing a micro-hydro scheme. At the same time, we have a vibrant volunteer culture in Sleat who have created a network of paths, social areas and a polytunnel where local school children can help grow saplings to regenerate the forest. The trust also operates #Skyenet # a community broadband network # a community transport scheme, Tormore Explore Forest School and the Visit Sleat tourism group, which promotes the area as a destination of choice for visitors.#From the Sleat Peninsula to the gateway to Skye in the south where a new access route to the island is being created by the members of the Broadford and Strath Community Company. They are developing a cycle path all the way from Kyle of Lochalsh to Broadford. One of the project pioneers is keen local cyclist, Andy Neison.#I used to commute from Teangue on Sleat to Kyle by bike,# he said. #I was really unnerved by the road from Breakish to Kyle with a high volume of fast-moving traffic. When friends told me about the old road from Broadford to Kyle I started exploring sections of it. It#s a good starting point and will become a pioneer project for the highlands.#After receiving a grant of £, from Sustrans, a sustainable transport charity, to fund engineering and traffic surveys, the Trust is now working to secure funding for a project officer to take the Skye Cycleway to the next phase. The community is heavily invested in the project with volunteers coming out in all weathers to clear sections of the old road, but this is a long-term project with hundreds of thousands of pounds ultimately needed to complete the full route from Kyle to Broadford.Over the Skye bridge, the Kyle and Lochalsh Community Trust is creating a vast community and visitor experience on a piece of land known as the Plock.Securing funding from the Scottish Land Fund enabled the Trust to take ownership of the Plock and the old Skye Bridge toll office and develop a masterplan for these two community assets. On the Plock itself, there will be a hub building with cafe, carpark and toilets, a network of accessible paths, a #pitch and putt# course, a Viking living village, accommodation pods, a watersports centre, wildle hide and a for thrill-seekers a huge zipline across the bay.Jo Wawrzyczek of the trust expects the Plock to attract , visitors a year. #This is an ambitious project that will cost almost £million,# she said. #However, it is very important for local people and businesses as it will help to create a great community space as well as keep visitors in our community for longer.#The trust also owns and manages the public toilets and pontoons in Kyle which will be a source of income for the project. With the aim of making the project self-sustaining, the Trust plans to lease the café and watersports centre on the Plock as well as generating income through the accommodation pods. Inspired by the success of other community-driven harbour developments such as Tobermory on Mull, Portree and Braes Community Trust want to maximise opportunities for local people and visitors through taking ownership of the harbour and improving facilities.The trust is currently in talks about relocating the oil tanks at the pier head which would be a breakthrough for the project and open up commercial opportunities. They are also considering a new road from the south to improve access and ert traffic away from the town centre. But according to development officer Fiona Thompson a new breakwater and pontoons will be the real game-changer for Portree.She said: #There have been aspirations for improvements to facilities at the harbour for over  years with little major investment.The harbour group are now closer than ever to realizing the community#s vision for a new, vibrant, welcoming port. A breakwater will allow us to provide overnight berths and efficient, comfortable transfer for cruise ship passengers, while a visitor centre will provide a warm highland welcome to visitors from across the globe. This project will be transformational for Portree and surrounding areas.#The community trusts of Skye and Lochalsh all have several features in common. They have vision, ambition, energy and drive and they are full of volunteers who are committed to bringing long-term projects to fruition for the benefit of their community # and their visitors # for decades to come."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Skye-Bridge-2018-winners.jpg","title":"skye bridge 10k race to kick start kyleakin gala","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe first bridge k was held  years ago, and since  hundreds have taken on the challenge in an event which has helped raise thousands of pounds for good causes based in Kyleakin and surrounding areas.back again.Online entry — which is discounted — will be open until Friday th August, or runners can register on the morning of the race for £.

At the age of  I started to fight back and The Island Boy is one part of the story.“I gave myself ten years to write a book and I had no idea what it was going to be about. Being part of the writers group has been a great help because it has taught me the importance of listening and picking up information from other people.“I wrote as much from my head as I could and I believe I have enough left for another book.”The Island Boy is set amid the wild beauty of small farms, bog land, streams and rivers which inspired dreams and adventure in the mind of an observant and inquisitive boy. Such a landscape was also a place of poverty.Leos earliest memories are heavy with grief and unhappiness, but these are gradually replaced by hope and enrichment which grew, not from material riches, but from the resources which can only result from the bonding of love of a close family.The book launch commences at pm and everyone is welcome.

They are intent on pursuing a strategy to undermine workers’ pay, terms and conditions as well as imposing price hikes excluding lower income users. There is now a substantial two-tier workforce with increasing numbers of casual workers coming in on poverty pay rates while those previously employed by Belfast City Council are being denied pay uplts, leaving their wages fall ever closer to the legal minimum.“The community has been left behind as well. Last year Unite called a protest against the price hikes and attacks on workers’ pay and conditions on the peaceline which drew signicant cross-community support from both the Shankill and Falls. Working class people are united in their opposition to the council’s austerity-driven policies on leisure services.“Belfast City Council voted to outsource leisure services to this company – they cannot wash their hands of the consequences of that for either the public or their former employees. We call on all parties to reconsider their positions and bring these public services back in-house and give all the GLL workers a decent pay uplt.”A spokesperson for GLL said the company would meet union representatives to “understand the issues they have”.“GLL remains committed to genuine engagement on these matters in the interests of all parties, and to ensure the seamless provision of services across all of our leisure centres,” the spokesperson added.A Belfast City Council spokesperson said: “Belfast City Council is disappointed to learn that strike action is being considered at the city’s leisure centres. Council is committed to working with GLL, its employees and their representatives to ensure the continued provision of leisure services to all our ratepayers across Belfast.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"bombay street play brings back memories for roma","story":"BRASSNECK Theatre Company’s latest productiontells the story of the burning of Bombay Street.Something in the Air will take to the stage at the Roddy’s for a limited run during the annual Féile an Phobail. Written by playwright Laurence McKeown and centred on events surrounding the pogroms, which led to the outbreak of the Troubles  years ago this August, the play details how sectarian violence erupted across the city, how families were forced to flee their homes and ended up taking refuge across the border. Brassneck Artistic Director Tony Devlin told the Andersonstown News how the play will coincide with the th anniversary of the events, which were the catalyst for the Troubles. “This play is a daring piece of writing that will force audiences to not only reflect on the  years since the Troubles began but through it we want to create a conversation for debate and discussion about how we collectively move forward for the benefit of future generations.“The play explores one woman’s journey from Bombay Street after that night when her family were forced from their home and forced to go to a place called Gormanston down south where these families stayed for a few months while Bombay Street was rebuilt or they were rehoused,” he said. “ years later, this woman, who was  at the time, is expecting a researcher from Dublin to come and talk to her about the events of that night. This character Rosie Murray is played by acclaimed actor Roma Tomelty who I have known for years and am delighted to be working with in this project.”Tony spoke of how the play was to be first performed at The MAC theatre back in May but had to be halted due to the tragic death of fellow lead actress Mary Jordan’s mother in a car accident in Dublin. “We cancelled the show and now are in a position to bring it back. Working on this, directing this has been an education for me having been born in the late ’s, I had never heard of Gormanston. I didn’t know we had refugees in our own country during this time in our history. “Myself and Laurence also wanted to focus on the North South ide which is an underlying theme in this play. We wanted to address how the North and South has been pulled apart since partition.”Roma Tomelty who portrays the character of Rosie Murray said she knew “exactly who she, Rosie, was” from the first few lines of the script. “I have known Tony a long time, he asked me to play the part and we have a long history. When I got the script, the first line is that ‘I went to St Vincent’s School’ – which I did so from then on in I thought I know exactly who you are. The play is marking this event. “I was on the road the night the burning of Bombay Street happened. We were trying to get home to Andersonstown, my aunt was burnt out of Dover Street. “There is a line in the play about ‘ordinary people living in extraordinary times’. I remember driving through the chaos that night, you just got on with it,” she said. Actor Mary Jordan’s character is now a researcher after “turning her back” on her former banking career during the Celtic Tiger. “My character becomes very interested in Rosie’s story and to learn that there were refugees from Belfast. She comes to visit Rosie to hear more and I can’t say anymore than that,” she added cryptically. “Audiences will find out more as the play progresses.”Something in the Air will run at the Roddy McCorley Social Club from Wednesday August  until Sunday August .Tickets are priced at £ and are available from the bar."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"family of joe burns raise over 3000 in","story":"THE family of a popular barman at The Chester have surpassed the £, mark in their fundraising efforts to keep his memory alive.Joe Burns died suddenly five years ago in July , aged just  after collapsing at his parent’s home.Joe was a fit and healthy boxer who trained regularly at the gym.Tragically, the day after his death, his girlfriend Sinead discovered she was pregnant with their daughter Bella who is now four-years-old.Soon after Joe’s death, his family learned Joe’s mum Una and sister Jeanette both carry the faulty gene for Long QT, an inherited condition that can cause heart rhythm disturbances. Left undiagnosed, it can cause sudden death where someone has an unexpected cardiac arrest.Every year since, Joe’s family and friends take part in the annual Belfast Marathon, with all proceeds going towards the British Heart Foundation who use the money to fund research into silent heart conditions.This year,  members of Joe’s family and friends raised £, from their Marathon efforts. Their recent fundraising efforts have brought their overall total since Joe’s death to an amazing £, for the charity.Joe’s sister Jeanette O’Neill said: “This is the third year we have taken part in the Belfast Marathon for the BHF in Joe’s memory. Each year we just keep getting bigger and better with more people from our community getting involved through the full marathon, fun run and relay.“When Joe died our family was absolutely devastated. He was a real character and everyone knew him. He made such a big impact on so many people and it’s amazing that so many of his friends are still so supportive and want to help our fundraising efforts.“We don’t want what happened to our family to happen to any other family so that’s why we fundraise for the BHF because their research into conditions like Long QT are making such a big dference.”Jeanette said they have been overwhelmed by the support from their local community since Joe’s death.“Friends and family have just been fantastic. We are also hugely grateful to the Thunderdome in Glengormley for hosting a buffet for Joe’s runners after the marathon.

Her family and friends then began an epic Save Our Sunflower Campaign, appealing to the Northern Ireland public to sign up to donate their stem cells in an effort to save her le.Despite the fact that she was told that finding a match was very rare, yesterday Sharon got the miracle she prayed hard for.\"It is just fantastic,\" she said. \"I just cant believe it. I havent stopped crying all day. But its all good. Its all happy tears.\"I am in the City Hospital today getting chemotherapy and I was down getting an x-ray. When I went back up to the room I had a missed call on my phone. It was Dublin calling and I dont know anyone down there so I thought it was the hospital phoning me. I thought that it must be bad news. I rang it back and then I hung up because I was on my own andit was bad news then I didnt think I would be able to talk to them.\"I got scared. I phoned my husband Alan and I asked himhe got a missed call too, and he checked and he did. So I knew then it was them. He rang them and it was engaged. My nerves were wrecked.\"He eventually texted me to say that he got through and did I want him to tell me now or wait until he came to the hospital. I thought that didnt sound too good.\"So I sat on the edge of my bed with one of the other girls here in the ward. And we were so nervous. And he came in the door with a big cheesy smile on his face and he said you got a nine out of  [match], Sharon and I just couldnt believe it. I started to cry. I wasnt expecting that at all.\"Sharon says that a full match would be a  out of , as would be the casestem cells were from a sibling. She said it is a \"true miracle\".\"A nine out of  is the closest Im going to get,\" she said. \"After being told that I have little chance worldwide of getting a match. I dont know anything about this person who has saved my le. I have just been told that I have to go down for a consultation in Dublin.\"I have just done my third chemo in the City Hospital and I will be here for another couple of weeks still until my bloods start to come up. I have to go to Dublin on August  for a consultation and, all being well, they are going to start me on the really intense chemo on August . Then Ill be getting the stem cells on September .\"I cant believe that this has happened. I would never have thought that it would come to this. You always hear of these things and think God love that woman, she never got anyone in the end, but to get that news that it worked, its amazing.\"I have a chart beside my bed where I record my temperature and things. I had a high temperature this morning and I put a sad face beside it. But then this afternoon I was filling it in and put I got a donor and a smiley face on it. It feels amazing. I have got so many messages from people, its just brilliant. Its overwhelming.\"Sharon acknowledges she still has a \"mountain to climb\".\"The intense chemo I am to get is very high risk. And there is a graft versus host disease to contend with, which is when the stem cells belonging to someone  go into your body and recognise they are in the wrong body and start attacking your organs. But the doctors give you medicine to stop it. I have a big hill to climb before the easy part comes. But there is light at the end of the tunnel.\"I am just over the moon, words cant explain how I feel at the minute. Things were looking very bad there and this is like someone has given me a chance of le again. This person has saved my le and I dont even know who they are.\"Sharon said she will be eternally grateful to all who signed up to stem cell donation since her sunflower campaign began.For details visit Save Our Sunflower Campaign on Facebook"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

On Thursday, Mr Smith revealed there is a photograph of the Queen in his private office at Stormont House.That same day, the DUP urged him to reinstate a portrait of the Queen, with party leader Arlene Foster saying it was \"ridiculous\" that it had been removed.The partys East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson said yesterday it was encouraging that Mr Smith was now going to get to grips with the issue. He added: \"It is important that the Secretary of State conducts the internal review which he has now committed to. \"It is entirely appropriate that as Her Majestys Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, he would see no dficulty with portraits of the Queen being displayed here in Belfast. \"We should ensure that displays such as Her Majesty are able to take place, recognising the constitutional position of Northern Ireland. \"In other embassies and government buildings across the world, there will be pictures of the Head of State on display. \"This is appropriate and such a display should therefore be the same for Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom.\"Ulster Unionist peer Lord Rogan had tabled a number of questions at Westminster seeking further answers from the NIO regarding the payout.But Lord Rogan says answers he has received over the removal of the royal portraits simply raise more questions, not least why Stormont House should be treated dferently to NIO HQ in London and Hillsborough Castle.\"Stormont House is the official HQ of the NIO locally and it is therefore only fitting that portraits of Her Majesty should be on display there to both reflect and respect the constitutional reality of the sovereignty of the United Kingdom in Northern Ireland,\" he said. \"This situation should never have been allowed to happen and is the result of meek and weak leadership within the NIO which must be brought to a swt end\". The NIO employee had allegedly claimed under human rights legislation that it was unfair for him to have to work in a location in which he could be offended by the royal portraits.It is understood that the portraits were replaced with a photograph of the Queen meeting the late Sinn Fein leader, and former Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness.But it emerged this week that all the paintings had since been taken down and replaced with landscapes. Responding to the controversy for the first time, a Sinn Fein spokesperson said yesterday: \"Since its creation, the six county state has been awash with symbols of the British and unionist identity. \"The Irish identity was deliberately erased from the official narrative.\"That imbalance needs to be fully addressed, not only in terms of the Irish nationalist identity, but in recognition of the ever-increasing ersity of this society. \"Where balance cannot be achieved, a neutral space should be the default option to ensure that no-one feels intimidated or uncomfortable.\"The Equality Commission has said a portrait of the Queen is not considered by it to be a sensitive item for display in a workplace in its guidelines. However, chief commissioner Michael Wardlow said the context of how it was displayed was key and could possibly lead to causing offence and disrupting workplace harmony.

Those included Foyle Jobs and Benefits Office on Asylum Road, Carlisle House on Carlisle Road and Orchard House on Foyle Street from early morning until .am.After the picket lines, members gathered for a rally at the City Hotel which began at .am.The -hour strike was organised to highlight an imposed “pay deal” of .% and changes to terms and conditions of employment which union officials claim have been implemented without proper and meaningful consultation.Ms Gates addressed the rally along with Gerry Murphy, President of Irish Congress of Trade Unionsand Niall McCarroll, Chairman of the Derry Trades Union Council .Mr McCarroll addressed a packed room at the City Hotel where he said all workers had taken action to bring about better working conditions.He said the Tory government was “attacking working class communities” and it is time to “fight back” by building solidarity amongst workers. “Let us together build up a working-class spirit and let the Tories know we can bring them down.”Meanwhile, Ms Gates was keen to dispel the notion of civil servants having well-paid “cushy jobs” as an “absolute myth”. She added: “There are civil servants relying on tax credits, second jobs, credit cards to bring them to the end of the month or to pay off debts and those using food banks.”She praised those in the room for leading the way, recognising that many,not all of them, could ill afford to go without pay for the day. “We have to say, enough is enough, they can’t keep piling work on us and saying they can’t even give us a decent pay increase.“Many workers are % worse off than ten years ago in real terms.”Referring to legal action which has been initiated for “failure to consult”, she informed those in attendance, that the judge has decided to forego a pre-hearing by instead fixing a court date.She added that there will be a “few white faces” in the Department of Finance who know their actions have been “discriminatory” as they have been “acting outside the law”. And concluded by saying “it’s time to strike a blow for all workers”.Other members of the audience were afforded an opportunity to speak and one worker, named Amy, said the government does not care about workers standards of living, nor their mental and physical health. She demanded a living wage for all.A motion was put forward by People Before Profit at last month’s full Council meeting calling on the Permanent Secretary at the Department of Finance to provide a “fair and just settlement” which was backed by all councillors.

It is perched above the Co Donegal village of Burt and attracts thousands of visitors every year.The fort is a powerful manestation of what remains of ancient Ireland and on a clear day, from its pinnacle, it is possible to get a glimpse of three counties-Donegal, Derry and Tyrone. The commanding and spectacular waterways of Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle lie to its west and east respectively.But, in the th Century the fort, once home to kings of old Gaelic order, was rapidly disintegrating towards extinction. It was however saved by the vision of one man who spearheaded its restoration just over  years ago.Dr Walter Bernard was born on May ,  at Newmarket, Co Cork. His father was a captain in the th Rles, a regiment of the British Army and was amongst the reinforcements that arrived in Brussels on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo in June of  but was apparently too late to take part in the famed history changing conflict.Walter became a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland in , a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland in  and Fellow of that college in .Between - Dr Bernard served as a surgeon throughout the Crimean War attending the wounded British soldiers at Inkerman and witnessed the ravages caused by small pox and cholera. He later recalled that for every man that was shot, fty more were killed by those diseases, particularly in the notoriously harsh winters of  and .On the journey home from the Ukranian battlefields, he saved a man from drowning and was awarded with a certicate from the Royal Humane Society. Then, with his experiences of military conflict at an end, Dr Bernard landed back in Ireland and settled in Buncrana before building up a very large medical practice in Derry. He ran this surgery for over sixty years and was a prominent member of the city’s branch of the British Medical Association as well as holding many public offices throughout his career.One such appointment was to examine the quality of water in the city for Londonderry Corporation at public facilities such as the Creggan reservoirs built in stages between -, and which supplied much of the city’s domestic and industrial water needs.His experience of the waterborne disease cholera in the Crimea made him an ideal candidate for this job.Dr Bernard also addressed the Medical Society of King and Queens College of Physicians on the issuer of diphtheria in April . He cautioned the assembled medics that there was a reason why the disease was largely absent from statistics sheets.He said: “There are few diseases about which so many mistakes in diagnosis are made.”He feared the misdiagnosis rate was so high that it was almost impossible to ensure that ‘true diphtheria’ was as common in a town as reported.Dr Bernard added: “Diphtheria occurs in Londonderry, I have no doubt whatever…in my practice it has been my lot to treat many cases of this disease.”At some point in , Dr Bernard paid a visit to Grianan of Aileach and many years later in , he said of the experience: “Seventeen years ago, when this traditional and historical place was first visited by me, I found it in a very ruinous condition, and from that time I commenced to take an interest in its associations.“Year after year I witnessed further advance of its ruin, and I clearly saw thatsomething were not soon done to arrest the progress of its destruction, it would be in a few years a thing of the past.”Grianan of Aileach is a hilltop fort that sits on top of Greenan Mountain in Inishowen just over  feet above ground level.The ringfort was thought to have been built in the sixth or seventh century, although there is some evidence to suggest that the site had been in use before that.Greek astronomer and cartographer Ptolemy penned a remarkably accurate map of Ireland in  A.D. from which maps were later created in the th and th centuries. He called the land ‘Iouernia’, thought to mean ‘abundant land’ from which the Irish names Eriu and Eire are derived. Amongst two sites identied as ‘regia’ or royal places in Ireland by the Greek map maker, one of them is believed by some historians to be the Grianan of Aileach.Whether Ptolemy pinpointed it or not, the Kingdom of Aileach was indeed one of Ireland’s royal sites of the Gaelic order. The fort was thought to have been constructed originally by the northern section of the Ui Neill clan, but between  A.D. and the thirteen centuries, over  kings from ious clans, some also High Kings of Ireland, held the throne of Aileach. The last man to be known as the King of Aileach was Aed Buide Ua Neill who died in .Despite ious interpretations, it is generally agreed that Aileach means ‘stony place’ and the word Grianan means ‘sunny place’ so that Grianan of Aileach broadly translates as ‘The Stone Palace of the Sunny View’.Whatever the actual meaning of its name, it is evident that it was an extremely important place. Aileach’s political and strategic importance was such that the annals of Irish history record that it was attacked at least three times. In , Finsnechta Fledach, King of Ireland, destroyed the fort.Again, in , when Muirchertach MacNeill was king, Viking raiders sacked the site when they settled at Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. It’s also thought that King Brian Boru came to Aileach in , but it was destroyed once more in , when another King of Munster, Muirchertach Ua Briaincame to Inishowen and plundered the region and razed the fort. The fort was laid to waste by O’Brien in revenge for O’Neill’s destruction of his royal seat at Kincora and he reportedly told his soldiers to each take a stone from the Donegal hillside so the place would be reduced to rubble.The fort itself could have served two main s both as a defensive and a ceremonial one and moreover as a settlement that was surrounded by ringforts of lesser importance. Whatever its actual , it is known that buildings of this nature were very rare in North West Ulster and its presence signies that its inhabitants were regarded as being very important.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe linking of St Patrick to the site is seen as attempt by Christian converts to place it firmly in that tradition whilst acknowledging its pagan history and the naming of a holy well right outside the ringfort in honour of Ireland’s patron saint seems to confirm that.There is also a mythological and folklore version of the founding of Grianan of Aileach which says the ringfort was built by Dagda , a god and the king of the Tuatha De Danann-the supposed ‘Tribe of the Gods’-a supernatural race in Irish mythology. The Tuatha De Danann are said to have invaded Ireland before the Celts and built strategic stone forts on the tops of hills.Dagda was said to have fought the Second Battle of Moytirra against the Fomorians and the fort at Aileach was built over the grave of his son Aedh who had been murdered.In , a Derry based group called the Irish Irelanders, enthusiastic Gaelic revivalists travelled to the site on Sunday afternoons and carried out some repairs. But, the splendour and historical intrigue of Grianan of Aileach had largely been ignored for many years until in , Dr Walter Bernard decided to begin its restoration in earnest.In the s, painter, musician, antiquarian and archaeologist George Petrie examined Grianan of Aileach when he was head of the Royal Irish Academy’s antiquities committee which was linked to the Irish Ordnance Survey.Petrie’s findings suggested that the hill many have been enclosed by many other ramparts and a line of stones leading up to the entrance which were all gone by then.But, despite his efforts, the expert’s findings remained confined to the records of the Royal Irish Academy, there were no efforts by the organisation to attempt any restoration of the ancient site.It was Dr Bernard who took practical action beyond the analysis of the site. He paid for the entire project that took place between - and recruited his crew of labourers from the farms surrounding Burt. They ferried the materials needed for the restoration on the back up small carts up supplied by the local landowners up the incredibly steep hill.What the doctor found at the site was a disorganised mess of which he said it was: “An immense circular heap of stones, with its grey fallen masonry scattered over the interior-no vestige of a wall, entrance passage, or central building.”Remembering that Walter Bernard was a medical doctor with no detailed description of what an ancient ringfort truly looked like and that there weren’t enough stones on site to complete the job, makes this story even more remarkable.Dr Bernard discovered many animal bones on the site including sheep, cows and goats and items like sling stones and warrior’s clubs. The most interesting stone object discovered was a ‘slab of sandstone, chequered into thirty-six squares’, believed to be a games board of some type.The doctor and his crew of labourers used the measurements of other Irish forts such as Staigue Fort in Co Kerry as the comparative basis for the restoration project at Grianan of Aileach. The finished product is a fort that stands . metres in diameter and more than five metres tall with walls that are almost four metres thick.Dr Bernard later described a part of the building project by saying: “To bind our work into a complete unity we had to gather around the hill about  or  loose stones-certainly not more,so many-and to split from the adjoining rocks, cropping up through the heather,  coping stones. These are supposed to serve instead of those removed by King Murdock O’Brien in .”Only speculation can be used to assessthe interior of today’s fort accurately resembles its ancient predecessor, but when the alternative was the complete disappearance of the Iron Age construction, then surely Bernard’s efforts become even more admirable.The fort has stood for centuries as a silent witness to major events of Irish history. From the top of Grianan fort you can just make out the location of the Co Donegal village of Rathmullen on the western bank of Lough Swilly.It was from Rathmullen in  that the chieftains Hugh O’Neill and Rory O’Donnell sailed with their families after the final defeat by the English taking with them the last symbols of the old Gaelic order once enshrined in its pomp by places such as Grianan of Aileach. Behind them in the distance the old fort sat on its hilltop as a fading reminder of a society and its traditions that would never .A legend says that in a secret cave on a hill beneath Grianan O’Neill’s warriors rest in a bewitched sleep in full armour and sitting on their horses ready for the next fight. The spell, says the legend, will only be broken when the next destined leader of Ulster arrives to lead them to victory.It is a myth that would have no visible attachmentit had not been for the passion of Dr Walter Bernard in the late th century in restoring Grianan of Aileach to something approaching its former glory.A tourist road to the fort was opened on September ,  by President of Ireland Eamon De Valera who was accompanied by Fine Gael TD for Donegal West, Pat O’Donnell, then Minister for Local Government. In the early s the Office of Public Works in the Republic of Ireland carried out further repairs to Grianan of Aileacgh after a wall collapsed. But as late as October  the Irish Government was being severely criticised by political representatives in Donegal for still failing to establish tour guides and other facilities at the ancient site.In his obituary contained in the Universities and Colleges magazine of December , , it was reported that Dr Bernard died suddenly at his residence in Buncrana on eight days previously on December . He was -years-old and was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Dr Bernard’s obituary ended: “He leaves a widow. His le was deeply scarred by three great sorrows, the deaths of his three children.”CAPTION: The volunteers involved in the restoration of Grianan of Aileach pictured at its official re-opening in ."},{"url":null,"title":"derry university group ready support development north west institution","story":"The Derry University Group has said it is willing to “advise and support” the local council in establishing an independent university in the city.A meeting was held between Council Chief Executive John Kelpie, Deputy Mayor Cara Hunter, and the new Secretary of State for NI this week where the ongoing campaign for a Medical school at Magee was discussed.The Derry University Groupfelt it was a prime opportunity to impress upon SoS Julian Smith the need for an independent university in the city.This month, Derry City  Strabane District Councillors unanimously backed a motion supporting the exploration of all options for university provision in the North West. That included the expansion of Magee and the possibility of an independent university put forward by the DUG.The move followed an intervention by Labour Peer Lord Adonis who convinced the House of Lords to publish a report on the improvement of higher education provision in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a university whose principal campus is in Derry.A spokesperson for the Derry University Group said it is clear that the momentum for a dedicated university for the North West is growing all the time.“In recent months, Derry Strabane Council and other major influencers in Westminster and Dublin have committed themselves to delivering an independent university for the North West.“There has also been huge support from US colleges, who want to partner with a standalone university in Derry. It is completely apparent that the public here want action from the governments on a new university, now, as a matter of urgent priority.”“The North West, despite the political uncertainty, is in a prime position to establish a new cultural and educational institution, which could act as a catalyst for the economic regeneration of the region and reverse the damage already being done by Brexit on the Derry and Donegal communities.“The Derry University Group is willing to advise and assist Council and others in developing and delivering a new university, as we have always done in the past.

This impact was particularly felt in areas like here in Strabane where pride in the hunger strikers, their courage and sacrice still remains undiminished almost  years on.”The roots of what took place in  began several years earlier, when in  Belfast republican Kieran Nugent became the first man to refuse to wear a prison unorm. In , republicans had been accorded what the British termed Special Category Status recognising the political nature of their offences.By the mid-s however, political status had been withdrawn and as the cages of Long Kesh were replaced by the concrete H Blocks, the new British policy of ‘normalisation’ was wholly designed to strike any notion of political credence away from the IRA campaign.When he entered the H Blocks, Kieran Nugent was instructed to put a prison unorm on by the authorities. He answered, ‘you’ll have to nail it to my back.’ This began five years of protest inside the prison and heightened violence outside it which resulted in dozens of deaths.The blanket and no wash protests of the first four years of the prison conflict yielded no concessions on the issue of political status.The years of isolation and living in dire conditions eventually brought the situation to a head. The choice was plain and stark. The protesting republican prisoners could either concede and serve out jail sentences classed as ‘ordinary criminals’ or escalate the protest to the last ‘weapon’ available to them inside a prison-the hunger strike.It was not a new tactic for the republican movement, and it drew its inspiration from stories from the old Gaelic order.It’s recorded in the annals of Irish history that when a citizen felt slighted by the ruling order, it was not uncommon for them to lie outside their dwelling and refuse food in the hope of publicly shaming the guilty party into reparation and or an apology.In , Thomas Ashe died in Mountjoy prison in Dublin after being force fed whilst on hunger strike demanding political status. Then, in , the Lord Mayor of Cork Terence McSwiney died after  days whilst on hunger strike in Brixton jail. And, next year in  to mark the centenary of the death of McSwiney, the National Hunger Strike Commemoration will take place in Cork city.Back in , Michael Gaughan died in Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight after  days on hunger strike, and shortly before the beginning of the prison blanket and no wash protests in Long Kesh, in February , another Mayo man, Frank Stagg died at Wakefield jail in Yorkshire after  days without food.The first Long Kesh hunger strike began on October , . The protestors set out a list of five demands: -The right not to wear a prison unorm -The right not to do prison work -The right of free association with other prisoners -The right to organise their own educational and recreational facilities and -The right to one visit, one letter and one parcel a week.Seven men, including Sinn Fein MLA Raymond McCartney said they would fast to the death in the pursuit of the re-establishment of political status. Simultaneously, three female republican prisoners also embarked on a strike in Armagh jail.As Christmas  approached, the British offered a deal which appeared to agree to the central demand of the right not to wear a prison unorm. One of the hunger strikers, Sean McKenna was close to death at this stage and the strike was called off. It later emerged that was really being offered was a deal to allow prisoners to wear ‘civilian type clothing’ supplied by the prison regime. The scene was therefore already set for a second strike.It began on March ,  when Bobby Sands refused to eat. Raymond McCartney said: “Obviously everybody’s memory of  is the fact that ten people died on hunger strike.“On March ,  the British Government removed political status. I think most people thought that this was a half-hearted attempt and they’d roll over within a short period of time.“But, clearly what was emerging was a complete change in policy by the British Government who were intent on the idea of ‘normalisation’, ‘criminalisation’ and ‘Ulsterisation’.“Instinctively, any of us who found ourselves in prison at that time, knew we were political prisoners and any attempt to criminalise us just wasn’t going to work. It became a battle of wills.“But, I think by the end of the hunger strike in October, , most people looking on were saying that whatever was going on in the North that nobody in their wildest notion thought it was a criminal conspiracy. They certainly saw it as a political conflict. They may not have agreed with the armed actions of the IRA, but they certainly viewed it as a political situation.“So, for us by that stage, the process of criminalisation was in tatters. But, there was a very high price paid because  people had died in prison and  or  people had died on the streets.“Within the prisons we knew that we still had work to do because what we had to do was turn that acceptance of political imprisonment into every day conditions. By the end of the hunger strike I suppose there was a big recognition of the dference between the criminal’s unorm and our own clothes was one manestation of it. And, over the years we continued to ensure the conditions in Long Kesh reflected that.“By the late s and early s, journalists were frequent visitors to the prison and left with the overwhelming impression that we were a ‘dferent type’ of prisoner. They may have gone out and had questions about who you were and what you were about but they were in doubt that we were political prisoners. That was a big source of validation.”The intensity of the events and scale of death and destruction between  and  in retrospect now seems enormous, but Raymond McCartney maintains that it paved the way for future political developments.“It was only five years, but it was a very intense five years. It is only when you get a bit older you realise just how short a time span it was, because when you roll onto  and the Good Friday Agreement there was an acceptance of the framework that there was a political conflict which had to be resolved by political means-the recognition of political mandates, the political framework to address all these issues, but at the core of that was the acceptance of political prisoners.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“There is no doubt there is evidence that there were elements within the British Government were determined that political status should not be granted for whatever reason.“Even in , when there was internment without trial and up to , people were held in conditions where they wore their own clothes. There was a recognition of the political conflict of one nature or another.“How that was defined by dferent people is a dferent matter. I know that other people have made the observation that for too long the British tried to deal with the North as a security issue. therefore, when you have a security mentality or emergency laws, emergency courts, emergency interrogation centres, everything is changed and turned upside down.“If you follow their logic from that point of view and they say ‘you cannot now say you are political prisoners’ whilst trying to pretend that everything  about the situation isn’t political too then the penny drops in a whole lot of ways.”The almost  years since  have provoked much debate within wider nationalism about whether or not the hunger strike was harnessed as a catalyst for the republican movement to embark on the path to politics.The election of Bobby Sands to Westminster and Kieran Doherty to the Dail was followed quickly by a debate within Sinn Fein about ending their policy of abstentionism from political institutions that would lead to a split in the republican movement in . The Derry News asked Raymond McCartney for his view on this.He said: “It is interesting now, because everyone has their story about what the origins of the peace process was. But, there is absolutely no doubt that when you look back as far as  that Gerry Adams that there needed to be a political way of resolving the conflict, because military stalemate was exactly that.“The famous Glover Report from the British Army accepted that there was not going to be a military defeat, was them in their own way, saying the IRA was a political force and that the guys in Long Kesh were political prisoners. They job they were sent to do, they couldn’t do and that was to impose a military defeat and by extension their laws of oppression were not going to work either.“It made the situation painful and made the conflict last longer. Then, whenever the formula for the Good Friday Agreement was put forward, some former prisoners will tell you that it was too high a price to pay, but the core accepted it was a political problem and without political solutions it was never going to be resolved.”When the first hunger strike ended in October of , Raymond McCartney had gone without food for  days. So, what are his own personal recollections of the physical effects of what took place “I suppose when you look at that time in , Martin Hurson died after  days whilst others like Kevin Lynch were approaching  days when he died.“In a very strange way hunger strike affects dferent people in dferent ways. Even the day the hunger strike ended in , I was still walking about, I was out of bed. But, there is no doubt that your body slows down.“My ability to see was greatly affected. But, the body is a remarkable piece of equipment and resilience is obviously built in. As you get older you reflect on it and it is dficult to work out in your head that you could sustain doing without food for  days and others for  days.“I suppose when you look at that time in , Martin Hurson died after  days whilst others like Kevin Lynch were approaching  days when he died.

My ability to see was greatly affected.“As you get older you reflect on it and it is dficult to work out in your head that you could sustain doing without food for  days and others for  days.”Undoubtedly, it was Margaret Thatcher more than anyone  within the British establishment at the time who demonstrated complete determination to use the protests in Long Kesh to ide and break the republican movement.Many commentators have pointed to the INLA assassination of her colleague Airey Neave in  as one reason why the British Prime Minister embarked on a path of total intransigence towards the IRA. However, Raymond McCartney believes that her thinking was a lot wider than that.“Whatever her antipathy towards Ireland was and what came with that, she was setting out a broader political stall. Look at how she treated the miner’s later on.“Reading state papers now, years after these events, her take on the miner’s strike wasn’t just a battle about conditions in the mines, it was about strategically tackling trade unions. It was a case of her saying who is the strongest union-who is the spine of the working class and acting on that.“I always remember that being in jail gives you the time to reflect and read and think and I also always remember that Bobby Sands out of all the people who had been in jail was very clear about what he was there for because he wrote it all down. Some of the things he wrote captures the way a writer works-it’s all encompassing and puts it out there in a very vivid way.“I had previously been interned, I had an understanding about what being a political prisoner was. You had your own clothes and a bit of freedom to associate with other prisoners and you didn’t feel that sense of captivity although you were locked up. Bobby Sands caught on very early that the British were trying to defeat us in the prisons. It wasn’t just about trying to give you a hard time or denying you your own clothes, it was that they had a core idea to break us.“One of the rewarding things for me personally was that the system we had in the end in jail was one based on equality. That we treated people as equals. If you couldn’t treat the person beside you as a comrade and an equal that you couldn’t expect anyone  to believe that you’d treat all people as equals as you went on through le.”Those wishing to attend the th National Hunger Strike Commemoration are asked to assemble on Sunday, August  at .pm at the Diamond in Lford before marching across the border into Strabane where Martina Anderson MEP will deliver this year’s main oration.CAPTION: Raymond McCartney spent  days on hunger strike in ."},{"url":null,"title":"studio2 summer dance","story":"Greater Shantallow Community Arts are seeking participants for their annual Summer Dance Camp.If you are between --years-old this is a fantastic opportunity to take part in an two-week long exciting event.

No details were provided on how existing vegetation will be retained and no bioersity checklist was provided.”The residents also employed planning consultant Lee Kennedy, who told the Council of his concerns that some demolition work to existing buildings on the proposed development site had already taken place, prior to planning approval and that trees had been felled along the rear boundary of the site close to the homes of the objectors.A spokesperson for the Waterfoot residents said: “Mr Kennedy went onto state that residents have expressed genuine fears about a threat to the remaining vegetation on the application site.“He reminded Council that they hold a duty of care to work in the public interest and offer protection to the remaining mature trees, by the serving of a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderunder the  Planning Act.”Mr Kennedy confirmed to the Derry News that he had submitted a request for a TPO from the Council, but “no action had been taken.”However, the Waterfoot Park residents say their fears were heightened again earlier this month when a team of workers appeared on the proposed development site and began to cut down more trees.A spokesperson for the residents told the Derry News: “On Friday, July  at .am the neighbours were woken with the sound of several power saws and saw a full team of tree cutters on site behind them.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Within an hour they had created absolute mayhem on the site, with trees felled all around and they were left when they fell.

Amongst other things requested, the case officer advised that a tree survey of the site was required, a landscaping plan to show existing trees and vegetation to be retained and additional planting to be shown and a bioersity checklist was to be submitted to advise on any existing ecology on the site.“The agent confirmed in correspondence dated, July  that a Phase  habitat survey was instructed to be carried out as well as a tree survey and would be submitted in due course.”However, the Council spokesperson added: “The Planning Department were made aware by an objector by email on July ,  that eight trees along the boundary of the site adjacent to properties in Waterfoot Park had been felled on July  at .am.“Council takes its obligations in respect of these matters seriously and has undertaken an appropriate course of action to ensure that the opinions of residents are and will be fully considered in the processing of the planning application.”CAPTION: Residents of Waterfoot Park have accused the Council of failing to provide a duty of care in relation to a proposed building development."},{"url":null,"title":"prime minister s powys visit","story":"Prime minister Boris Johnson visitedBVG Retail Group in Brecon last Tuesday ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtth July ..Picturltspan classtruncate-full-screengted is Boris Johnson talking to County Times Chief Reporter Rory Sheehan..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Prime Minister’s Powys visitPrime minister Boris Johnson visitedBVG Retail Group in Brecon last Tuesday ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtth July ..Picturltspan classtruncate-full-screengted is Boris Johnson and Chris Davies talking to County Times Chief Reporter Rory Sheehan..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Prime Minister’s Powys visitPrime minister Boris Johnson visitedBVG Retail Group in Brecon last Tuesday ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtth July ..Picturltspan classtruncate-full-screengted is Boris Johnson, Iain Burgessand Chris Davies..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Prime Minister’s Powys visitPrime minister Boris Johnson visitedBVG Retail Group in Brecon last Tuesday ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtth July ..Picturltspan classtruncate-full-screengte by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Prime Minister’s Powys visitPrime minister Boris Johnson visitedBVG Retail Group in Brecon last Tuesday ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtth July ..Picturltspan classtruncate-full-screengted is Boris Johnson meeting members of staff..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"machynlleth carnival 2019 event celebrates","story":"Moon landers : Olivia Garrod , Harry Smithand Izzy Owen ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt drop in on Machynllltspan classtruncate-full-screengteth Carnival.

If we all do a little bit, wersquoll ensure the service is maintained for today, tomorrow and future generations.Earlier this year, local politicians agreed to take the lead in securing financial support for the air ambulance service and also make a monetary contribution to help meet the servicersquos poundm annual running costs.The Department of Health allocates around poundm in annual funding to help keep the helicopter service in the air with money used to finance the air ambulance crew, medicines and medical equipment. Charity funds, including public donations, sustains the aviation side of the operation.It was announced recently that as part of the ongoing consultation on reshaping stroke services, the Department has made a commitment to extend the partnership with Air Ambulance Northern Irelandto enable the helicopter emergency medical service to provide a secondary response to incidents, including strokes, by .Health officials have also confirmed that any changes to the existing arrangement would be subject to the completion of an appropriate business case and agreement with the air ambulance with regard to any funding implications..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charity Beer and Bubbles 5k run in Finnebrogue  ","story":"M B McGRADY  Co Chartered Accountants is setting the pace this September with the launch of the Beer and Bubbles k run in a bid to raise money for Air Ambulance NI.Open to competitors of all ages and experiences, the race will take place on Thursday, September , at Finnebrogue Woods, nestled on the outskirts of Downpatrick.This is the first k race to take place at the idyllic venue, with the route mapped out so runners take in the stunning woodland and finish close to the lakeside, where they will be able to soak up the atmosphere while enjoying a glass of local beer or prosecco.The event follows on from last yearrsquos successful M B Grady  Co Ultimate Aqua Challenge,.Conaill McGrady, director of M B McGrady  Co, said: ldquoWe are delighted to be supporting Air Ambulance NI for a second year and helping to contribute to maintaining the vital work that they do.

They opened the scoring through Gareth George and he added a free to give the visitors an early cushion.Indeed, Bright had plenty more chances to add to this score, but were wasteful in their shot selection. The Holywood men finally woke up and a tidy score from Connor McAnespie after  minutes opened their account.Bright again replied with a fine score from Marc Burke before Martin Cox opened his account for Holywood with a point after  minutes. Barry Kilkey levelled the contest three minutes later from close range and Freddie OrsquoConnor scored for Bright to edge them ahead again.Foolish tackling and unnecessary frees were costing St Paulrsquos in the game and helped Bright dominate the play In the first half.The gamersquos opening goal, however, swung the play towards the Holywood men again. Fantastic work from Seaacuten Tucker around the middle of the park and his long ball into the danger area found Marty Cox in space.Cox caught the ball in mid-air, landed and turned in one motion before smashing the ball past Michael Ferrand, who had no chance. The sizable crowd roared with delight and momentum was now with St Paulrsquos as Tucker added another score from play.Once again, however, ill discipline and poor tackling would cost St Paulrsquos.

The game was tied at - to - drawing at  when St Paulrsquosadded their second goal in the th minute.Fine work from Daniel Eastwood and Cox set up Tucker who danced around two Bright defenders before slotting the ball home from  metres. The home crowd were again in raptures, expecting St Paulrsquos to see the game out.However, game management has been a big problem this season for the Holywood men, given the average age of the team is  it is perhaps understandable that experience to see games out is just not there yet.St Paulrsquos tried to slow the game down, but with about  minutes still to be played, it was far too early for that. Bright caught St Paulrsquos in possession on numerous occasionsand turned the ball over for score after score.George was a constant threat and punished each mistake by the Holywood men with a score.

He did, however, admit that the itinerary has been sent to Rome.Venues for the Popersquos visit are pure speculation and certainly newspapers are free to speculate, he added.It is understood that Downpatrick was one of the three venues north of the border suggested by the committee of  bishops, headed by Cardinal OrsquoFiaich, when they met last week.The decision on whether the Pope will include Northern Ireland in his tour will be taken in Rome, but it is believed that alternative venues in the Republic have been suggestedthe Pope decides not to cross the border.The choice of Downpatrick mdash with its strong historical links with Christianity and St Patrick mdash is understood to have been a move to give the Pope the opportunity to see as many people as possible.It is also thought that Armagh mdash the ecclesiastical headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland mdash and Londonderry were studied as possible venues for a visit.Until the programme is finalised, the only places certain to be included in the itinerary are Dublin and the Marian Shrine at Knock, County Mayo.Dr Joseph Maguire, Parish Priest of Downpatrick, said that he personally had not been contacted about any visit from Pope John Paul II, but he admitted that Downpatrick would have been one of the first places to think of.ldquoWe would be delighted to be so honoured with a visit from the Holy Father and he would be most welcome he said.KILLYLEAGH mdash A one-day token strike by production workers closed the Killyleagh Mill yesterday.Around  workers walked out, seeking a wages increase.

Two special zones will be developed for car parking on either side of the beach and a park for upwards of  cars will be provided in the centre, off the beach area.Under no circumstances, however, will cars be allowed to drive up and down the beach area and the council is expected to appoint full-time beach inspectors to supervise parking during the summer season.The private entrances presently used by beach-goers will be blocked off and two new public driveways will be constructed. It is thought that charges for cars to the beach will be scrapped.Other developments at the beach will include the provision of new toilet blocks and the construction of - self-catering holiday homes for renting.NEWCASTLE mdash A new peal of six church bells will ring out over Newcastle this year.

For the BBC formally to march in Pride would be unacceptable too. Therefore it is welcome that its director general in Northern Ireland has stated that the BBC will not be represented corporately at today’s parade.\"  \"  Ben Lowry: Cyprus gang rape case is reminder that fake claims can happen and the need for jurors to be aware of that possibilityWe at the FTA have campaigned for the dualling of the A road and welcome Monday’s opening of a new stretch Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingUpdated: PSNI probe sudden death of teenagerManarrested in N.I. on suspicion of sexual activity with a child arrested in N.I. on suspicion of sexual activity with a child\"Three vehicle road traffic collision -

Then he said there were royal portraits in Hillsborough Castle, and that Northern Ireland enjoyed many royal visits.He also said he recognised “the importance of the NIO being an open and inclusive place to work”.So what was he saying  That royalty, royal images and visits are part of the cultural hinterland at the NIO, as you might expect in Her Majesty’s government  Or that the NIO interprets ‘inclusivity’ to mean that such imagery is a problem  If he is not saying the latter, why cite inclusivity Then, around the same time that we revealed further details of this shambles, and Mr Smith’s inept response, it emerged that the NIO had lost a key advisor, Jonathan Caine.Lord Caine, as he has been since , has been an advisor on Northern Ireland matters to two prime ministers since , David Cameron and Theresa May, and four secretaries of state Owen Paterson, Theresa Villiers, James Brokenshire and Karen Bradley.But his experience is greater than the last nine years of Tory rule. He was involved in the party in the s, when he advised the NI secretaries Peter Brooke and Patrick Mayhew, prior to Tony Blair taking officein .It is essential that NIO ministers have this sort of high level advice from people who know what is going on, and have an institutional memory of politics in the Province.\"  \"  Ben Lowry: Cyprus gang rape case is reminder that fake claims can happen and the need for jurors to be aware of that possibility Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"In Lord Caine’s case, such NI experience is unrivalled in Westminster or the Tory Party, yet he has not been kept on by Mr Smith.In case any unionists have somehow not yet noticed, we are deep in crisis on a range of issues: cultural, constitutional, historical and legal.The Irish government is increasingly adopting a joint stewardship approach to Northern Ireland.Lord Caine is one of few people,not the only person, who tried to push back against this from a moderate unionist perspective.That is not to say his advice was always listened to. Patently, and regrettably, it wasn’t. There are competing voices and a long-standing culture of deference to Ireland’s Department of Foreign Affairs .As this column noted last week, NIO ministers will now almost never so much as verbally challenge the relentlessly partisan Irish. In the past, Owen Paterson and Theresa Villiers sometimes challenged it. Mr Smith urgently needs an experienced voice who will explain to him when joint statements with Simon Coveney are appropriate, and when they are not. A voice who will tell him when to ignore demands ofhis senior officials or of Dublin.That voice is now gone.Alarmingly, I understand that Lord Caine at times tried to resist Irish overreach in ious talks, and their failure to observe the three strands, which dictate when Irish input is apt, but did not always find unionist politicians inclined to take a robust stance .One immediate way to lay down a marker is to reinstate the NIO portraits, and face down complaint.A further is to make clear that London will pursue legacy cases, such as funding civil actions against terrorists and setting up inquiries, given that republicans are relentlessly chasing the past and Ireland has tried to humiliate the UK at both the Strasbourg human rights court and the Council of Europe . Another is to insist that the talks process faithfully uphold the three stranded approach and to observe the constitutional proprieties of Dublin’s role. Meanwhile, now that Boris Johnson is styling himself minister for the Union, he could perhaps now draw on Lord Caine’s experience.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: Cyprus gang rape case is reminder that fake claims can happen• Ben Lowry last week: Julian Smith needs to reverse NIO weaknessJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"have a referendum in northern ireland on the backstop five years from now  ","story":"....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  TriggerPrompt url  https:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude + url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Opinion Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Offbeat People Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           Have a referendum in Northern Ireland on the backstop five years from nowLetter to the editorPublished::Saturday  August Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substring.article-sharetool.article-sharetool--mobile Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substring.article-sharetool.article-sharetool--mobile Sign Up To Our Daily Newsletter ipaddress.getJSON .keypress.focus.on email  .val.ajax\",source_url: location.href,source_website_category: \"Letters\", \"text\".done .removeAttr  .htmlThanks,  + email +  has been added to our newsletter..

And Irsquove also been talking about sport ndash this time football and ensuring young people can get involved in teams, but also have opportunities to progress within their chosen sport as well.In Westminster Irsquove been talking about serious violence and ensuring we get police on our streets to deal with kne crime and other violence, which sadly wersquove seen on the rise in some parts of the UK.Irsquove also been talking about the steel industry. Steel is a crucial backbone here in Wales, but there is worrying news from some parts of the industry across the UK. Irsquom glad to say that we have a thriving steel plant here in the constituency, employing a lot of people who produce steel for our construction industry and many other infrastructure projects ndash but itrsquos crucial that those projects are open to Welsh steel, in order to drive jobs and business here in our local community.In the Commons I challenged the Conservative Welsh Secretary over what I believe is his failure to stand up for our steel industry.I asked him: ldquoSteel is of course the foundation of any successful industrial strategy.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners.

He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

The pension applies to both Vale and Cardf council workers.Friends of the Earth Cymru congratulated the council.Spokeswoman Bleddyn Lake said: ldquoAfter years of lobbying by Friends of the Earth, itrsquos fantastic to see Cardf councillors taking the historic decision to stop supporting the fossil fuel companies that are fuelling the climate crisis.ldquoNow itrsquos time for all the local authority pension funds in Wales to follow Cardfrsquos lead.ldquoToo many have been hiding away from taking meaningful action, but a climate emergency means we cannot afford to be investing money in the very companies driving climate change.ldquoResearch has shown esting from fossil fuel companies is better financially and will minimise future financial risks for those with pensions in these funds.ldquoClimate change is the challenge of our age. We canrsquot afford to push action further down the road all the time or expect others to be the ones to sort out this mess.ldquoWe want to see the Wales Pension Partnership, the Welsh Assembly, the Welsh Government and all other public body pension funds ditch fossil fuel investments and we will be keeping the pressure up until they do the right thing, both for the planet and for future generations here in Wales and around the world.Previous research by Friends of the Earth found that the eight local authority pension funds in Wales invested over poundbn between them in fossil fuel companies.Last year Monmouthshire Council was the first in Wales to vote to est its pension fund from fossil fuel companies. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Regular patrol flights are common in the region.Iranrsquos air force has an assortment of US-made military aircraft purchased before the  Islamic Revolution.It also has Russian-made MiG and Sukhoi planes.Decades of Western sanctions have made it hard to maintain the ageing fleet..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Iran  useizes tanker carrying smuggled fuel u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A statement, signed by  business organisations and trade bodies, says that “two and a half years on from the collapse of the Executive, and now approaching the likely conclusion of the Brexit process, the Northern Ireland business community is deeply concerned at the continued absence of a ing administration and is calling on political representatives to redouble their efforts to reach agreement to get the Assembly and Executive working again”. “There has seldom been a time when strong and effective leadership has been more necessary, both to deliver on the domestic agenda and also to speak up for Northern Ireland in the Brexit process. “We need a fully ing administration to agree and deliver a Programme for Government that will build infrastructure, reform our health service and education system, ensure we have a strong economy, and create opportunities for our young people. We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise. Without such a commitment and associated action from our elected representatives, we risk irreparable damage to our economy and our society for which future generations will judge us harshly.””  The letter has been signed by the following organisations: Belfast Chamber Causeway Chamber of Commerce CBI NI Centre for Competitiveness Construction Employers Federation NI Federation of Small Businesses Northern Ireland Freight Transport Association Hospitality Ulster IoD NI Londonderry Chamber of Commerce Manufacturing NI Mineral Products Association NI Newry Chamber of Commerce  Trade NI Grain Trade Association NI Hotels Federation NI Tourism Alliance Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association Northern Ireland Retail Consortium Retail NI Women in Business NIView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/qub_1.jpg","title":"simon hamilton strong desire for orderly brexit","story":"Posted on Friday August  by John Mulgrew Former jobs minister Simon Hamilton says there is a strong desire to achieve “an orderly Brexit” to avoid long term damage to the economy, as he takes up his new role as head of Belfast Chamber.Mr Hamilton, a former DUP MLA who held several ministerial posts at Stormont – including as Economy Minister – said % of its members backed the initial Withdrawal Agreement, and he will work with them to support a soft exit from the EU.“There’s a desire to make sure there wasn’t a clf edge, and it doesn’t have a detrimental effect on business,” he said. “Belfast Chamber members say they support an orderly Brexit – it’s a common sense place to be.”“… they are pragmatic.
