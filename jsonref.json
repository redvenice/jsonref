The plan will help save the company $6 billion by 2020, according to GM\u0027Those are good architectures from a fuel economy perspective ... we\u0027ll continue to put those in the market, but we can take down our capital expenditures, while investing in electric and autonomous vehicles,\u0027 said Barra. \u0027You will see a greater share invested in autonomous and electric vehicles, both from a capital expenditure and\u0027 increased hiring for electric and self-driving engineering jobs.In a press statement, the company said it will close the Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Plant in Detroit and Warren Transmission Operations in Warren.Other plants closing include the Oshawa Assembly Plant in Oshawa, Ontario, the Lordstown Assembly in Warren, Ohio, and the Baltimore Operations in White Marsh, Maryland.The company also plans to stop building several models now assembled at those plants, including the Chevrolet Cruze, the Cadillac CT6 and the Buick LaCrosse.\u0027The actions we are taking today continue our transformation to be highly agile, resilient and profitable, while giving us the flexibility to invest in the future,\u0027 said GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra.\u0027We recognize the need to stay in front of changing market conditions and customer preferences to position our company for long-term success.\u0027          GM will lay off 14,700 factory and white-collar workers in North America and put five plants up for possible closure as it restructures to cut costs and focus more on autonomous and electric vehicles. One of those closures would be the Oshawa plant in Canada (pictured) The reduction includes 8,100 white-collar workers, some of whom will take buyouts and others who will be laid off. Most of the affected factories build cars that won\u0027t be sold in the US after next year. They could close or they could get different vehicles to build. They will be part of contract talks with the United Auto Workers union next year.About 6,000 factory workers could lose jobs in the US and Canada, although some could transfer to truck plants.The plan will help save the company $6billion by 2020, according to GM. The announcement is the biggest restructuring in North America for the US No. 1 carmaker since its bankruptcy a decade ago. The Monday closure of GM\u0027s plant in Oshawa, Ontario, was confirmed late Sunday by an official familiar with the decision.GM opened its factory in Oshawa, near Toronto, in 1953. The plant is used to make the Cadillac XTS and Chevrolet Impala sedans as well as the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks.The company  has three other sites in the province of Ontario. It is unclear whether they will also be affected GM needs to reshape the company as it shifts its focus to lower emitting hybrid vehicles, technology that is not at the forefront at the Canadian plant.Too many GM factories are devoted to making slow-selling cars and the company can no longer afford to keep them all operating without making some tough decisions. But the political atmosphere might limit realistic choices for the Detroit automaker.           In a press statement, GM officials announced the closure of Lordstown Assembly (pictured) in Warren, Ohio          The company will also close the Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Plant (pictured) in DetroitThe company said that the moves will help continue its focus on crossovers, SUVs and trucks. With the move, GM plans to cut 25 per cent of the executive staff and 15 per cent of the salaried and salaried contract staff.\u0027These actions will increase the long-term profit and cash generation potential of the company and improve resilience through the cycle,\u0027 Barra said in the statement.The closure of the Lordstown plant in Ohio didn\u0027t shock some analysts who predicted that location as one of GM\u0027s targets.  The car produced there is also is built in Mexico. The once-bustling factory already has lost two of its three shifts and 3,000 union jobs since the beginning of last year.Barra did not link the cuts announced Monday to tariff pressures, but said trade costs are among the \u0027headwinds\u0027 GM has to face as it deals with broader technology change and market shifts.With US car sales lagging, several car plants have fallen to just one shift, including its Hamtramck and Lordstown, assembly plant. Travel chaos on DC to NYC corridor after Delaware Memorial...Online sales hit a record £4bn on Cyber Monday - as...Share this articleA rule of thumb for the automotive industry is that if a plant is running below 80 per cent of production capacity, it is losing money. GM has several plants running well below that. Consultancy LMC estimates that Lordstown will operate at just 31 per cent of production capacity in 2018. Rivals Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV have both curtailed US car production. Ford said in April it planned to stop building nearly all cars in North America. The industrywide slowdown in passenger car sales started to pick up steam in 2017.The shift by US consumer preferences have been away from passenger cars to larger, more comfortable SUVs and pickup trucks has been swift and severe, leaving automakers scrambling to readjust.As recently as 2012, passenger cars made up more than 50 per cent of all US new vehicle sales. Through the first nine months of 2018, that had fallen to a little over 31 percent.While industry-wide passenger car sales were down 13.2 per cent through the first nine months of the year, pickup truck and SUV sales rose 8.3 per cent. As well as being roomier, the fuel economy on SUVs and crossovers has improved significantly.

That\u0027s assuming he even survives the 260-day journey.At about 8pm last night that journey was successfully completed by Nasa\u0027s latest robotic probe — the $1 billion InSight Lander, designed to explore the internal structure of the planet.          Anyone who has seen the film The Martian starring Matt Damon (above) as an astronaut accidentally left behind on the planet  will have a sense of the brutal hostility of the Red Planet          Elon Musk, the increasingly erratic billionaire founder of the Tesla car company, says he is seriously considering moving to Mars is surely the most bizarreAt this stage I should come clean and reveal that I didn\u0027t actually go to Mars last year.Instead of going to the bother of travelling some 34 million miles —the distance at which the planet is closest to our own — I journeyed a somewhat less epic 4,200 miles to Huntsville in Alabama, where I spent a few days at Space Camp at the United States Space and Rocket Center.I learned a little of what it would be like not only to travel to Mars, but also to live there.Anyone who has seen the film The Martian (it\u0027s on Film4 tonight at 9pm) — starring Matt Damon as an astronaut accidentally left behind on the planet by his crewmates in a storm — will have a sense of the brutal hostility of the Red Planet. Damon plays out a compelling struggle for survival, growing food in human waste and trying to contact Earth.His Hollywood-scripted survival is ultimately uplifting, but not very likely.As well as the cold, the atmosphere on Mars is not ideal for humanity. As it consists of 96 per cent carbon dioxide, you would suffocate to death pretty fast if you removed your space helmet.The best you could hope for would be a swift death — the Martian atmosphere\u0027s extremely low pressure would mean the air in your lungs would be sucked out of you.          People watch the landing of NASA\u0027s InSight spacecraft on the planet Mars on television screens at NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena on Monday          The first image acquired by the InSight lander after it touched down on the surface of MarsThen, the gasses in your blood would start to bubble, an extreme form of what ers call \u0027the bends\u0027. Worse still, because of the low pressure, the boiling point of liquid is much lower than it is on Earth — and your saliva and tear ducts would boil.However, if Mr Musk is sensible and keeps his spacesuit on, there is much to enjoy about gallivanting around Mars.With the gravity about 38 percent of Earth\u0027s — the gravity of the Moon is 17 percent — it\u0027s possible to make reasonably giant leaps for mankind.I was fortunate enough to try walking around Mars at Space Camp, by being attached to a harness and a counterweight to simulate the lack of gravitational pull.Enormous fun for someone who was always terrible at the high jump. With little effort, I was able to leap up to the equivalent of a first-floor window, and felt I could almost fly. It was impossible not to sport a silly grin.But while I was jumping around in my bulky space suit, I was expected to complete a series of rudimentary manual tasks while manoeuvring up and down a 40ft wall. Though I\u0027m relatively fit, I soon found the effort of keeping \u0027afloat\u0027 and moving things around while wearing a cumbersome outfit pretty tiring.If he really wants to be a Martian, Mr Musk will need to spend time in the gym.          Engineer Kris Bruvold, bottom center, celebrates as the InSight lander touch downs on Mars Once he has mastered getting around, he will be rewarded with some magnificent natural sights.He could take a trip to the solar system\u0027s tallest volcano — Olympus Mons — a staggering 16 miles high. Or negotiate the fabulous Valles Marineris, a network of valleys about the same distance as London to Israel — some 3,000 miles.Of course, what space tourists will always be aware of is the Martian sky — almost permanently orange, owing to the high dust content in the atmosphere.Then there would the arresting sight of Mars\u0027s moons, which have wonderfully evocative names — Deimos and Phobos.With its truly dismal atmosphere, the only way to endure the planet is to stay indoors, which, in itself would be a huge challenge, for the simple reason is that there is no \u0027indoors\u0027 on Mars. Because of radiation and violent dust storms, an entire base would have to be built underground, with the sections prefabricated on, and brought from, Earth — like building a flat-pack house from Ikea.So Elon Musk is absolutely right when he says his days would be spent building his home.          Even if he and his fellow Muskonauts — as he\u0027d probably insist on calling them — managed to put it all together, they would need to make their habitat sustainable.The challenges of achieving this are shown in the latest season of the drama Mars, being shown on the National Geographic channel (pictured).Hydroponic gardens — in which plants are cultivated without soil — would need to be built to grow food, and those plants would also provide essential oxygen.Forget growing things in Martian soil — it is impossibly toxic. Natural light would also have to be mimicked, to maintain humans\u0027 natural biological \u0027clocks\u0027, or circadian rhythms.Then there is the problem of living with fellow humans in a confined space for years at a time — if not until the end of your life.Irritability is a real problem, and it is for this reason all those who visited Mars would have to undergo extensive psychological profiling.          An artist impression of NASA\u0027s InSight lander about to land on the surface of MarsNews from home might make life easier, but you can forget video message conversations with the wife and kids. Even when Mars is closest to Earth, messages will take four minutes to send and receive via a radio signal, though when Mars is at its furthest — nearly 250 million miles — it stretches to 48 minutes.One big problem remains: where will the colonists obtain their water? Fortunately it looks like there are ice deposits buried not too deeply beneath the Martian surface, and it\u0027s possible they could be mined.Of course, mining requires energy, which is likely to be produced by solar power.So it\u0027s clear sustaining life on Mars is a very fragile business. If just one link in the chain breaks, the result could be catastrophic.The men and women who could live there will need to be calm, rational and scientific, and not prone to impulsiveness.So the capricious Elon Musk may well have the vision to get to Mars, but whether he could thrive there is a different matter entirely.Mars continues Sundays at 8pm on the National Geographic channel.    "},{"url":null,"title":"Le Grand Diversion Paris burning Macrons popularity plunging","story":"    Several hours of violent mayhem on Saturday saw riot police fight with almost 10,000 demonstrators in Paris (pictured: A demonstrator throws debris at a burning barricade while  on the famed Champs Elysees avenue)          Emmanuel Macron, the so-called ‘President of the rich’, is in crisis. His approval ratings are at a record lowFor the past two weekends, the disgruntled provinces have marched on the capital to protest at proposed fuel tax hikes, and Macron’s approval ratings are at a record low. His response? He has tried to create a distracting diplomatic row.On Sunday, while France was still reeling from the images of violence in Paris, the French leader announced, to the fury of British MPs, that he would use the newly signed EU Brexit deal to try to ‘leverage’ concessions from the UK on fishing rights.Unless the UK agreed to allow EU vessels the same access to British waters as they have now, the talks on a wider trade deal would fail, he said, forcing the UK into the ‘backstop’ customs union permanently.Most of the gilets jaunes — named after the hi-viz jackets they wear, which every French motorist must by law carry in their car — are not much interested in fishing. But here was Macron being presidential, faced by a traditional national opponent all can unite against: Perfidious Albion.Yesterday, Theresa May rounded on Macron, saying he was wrong to suggest he could prevent the UK taking back control of its fishing grounds. The PM told MPs that the UK would become an ‘independent coastal state’ after Brexit, following her success in rejecting EU demands to link access to markets for British seafood products to access to British waters for foreign trawlers.‘The EU have maintained throughout this process that they wanted to link overall access to markets to access to fisheries,’ she said.          Yellow vests (gilets jaunes) shout slogans  during a protest near the Arc of Triomphe on Saturday‘They failed in the Withdrawal Agreement and they failed again in the Political Declaration.’In a direct response to Macron’s threat — which was at odds with other EU leaders who lamented the UK’s departure — she added: ‘It is no surprise some are already trying to lay down markers again for the future relationship. But they should be getting used to the answer by now — it is not going to happen.’The PM is probably right, and Macron’s troubles are too longstanding and too deep for a fuss about fishing quotas to do him much good.In the past ten days two people have been killed and more than 600 injured in the fuel tax protests. Hundreds more have been arrested across France.While the gilets jaunes have a specific grievance, their protests are symptomatic of a wider disenchantment with the occupant of the Elysee Palace. As one commentator put it: ‘Anger with Macron had crystallised into a cause’.No10 fury at Trump trashing Brexit deal: Backlash after...Melania WILL go with President Trump to Argentina G20...Rioting looters stole £1million worth of goods from...Theresa May hits back at Emmanuel Macron and vows to block...Share this articleOnly 18 months after his election, Macron’s approval ratings have slumped to 26 per cent, a record low for a French head of state. A poll last week showed more than 70 per cent of the population backed the yellow vest protests.Eighty per cent agreed with the assertion that Macron is the ‘president of the rich’, pandering to the affluent while the French unemployment rate is approaching 10 per cent (more than double the UK’s).He has even been overtaken in the polls by Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party (a rebranded version of her father’s racist Front National).So how has it come to this?To say Macron’s shock victory in May 2017 broke the mould of French politics would be an understatement. At the head of his new En Marche movement, he ground the old establishment of socialists and the centre-Right into the dust.Good-looking, articulate and assured, the one-time minister in the previous Socialist government made a virtue of being different from those who had gone before. Aged 39, he was the youngest ever President. He had married his school drama teacher, who is 25 years his senior — and they have no children of their own. France was his family, he said.          For the past two weekends, the disgruntled provinces have marched on the capital to protest at proposed fuel tax hikesThere was a brief honeymoon period. Macron was — and is — a charismatic presence on the international stage, calling for a more integrated EU and opposing populist politics.While a liberal progressive in domestic social matters, he was astute and ruthless in facing down the powerful unions in his largely successful early efforts to reform the hidebound French economy and labour laws.Earlier this year a Macron supporter told me: ‘He is doing something very rare in France ... and that is standing firm against powerful interest groups.‘He is saying and doing things no politician dared say before. France, you must remember, is in the same position as Britain in the late Seventies. It desperately needs reform.’But now many believe the politician known to his supporters as ‘Jupiter’ — leader of the Roman gods — has grown imperious, arrogant, outspoken, condescending. Success has gone to his head.He is accused of spending lavishly on personal luxuries paid from the public purse — he spent £23,000 on make-up in three months last year — while expecting the public to tighten their belts.He painted himself as different but critics have pointed out that he has the same background as the old guard, went to the same schools — he is a graduate of the elite Ecole Nationale d’Administration — and worked for the Rothschild investment bank, earning €2.9 million (£2.6 million) advising Nestle on one deal alone.He talks down to the poor and would prefer to chase benefit fraud than millionaire tax cheats.Last autumn, as his austerity measures began to bite and after he had proposed reducing a wealth tax and cut the maximum rate of the capital gains levy, the ‘president of the rich’ tag gained traction. During an infamous TV interview early this year, he refused to use the term ‘tax evasion’. Instead, he insisted on the vague phrase ‘fiscal optimisation’.          On Sunday, while France was still reeling from the images of violence in Paris, the French leader announced, to the fury of British MPs, that he would use the newly signed EU Brexit deal to try to ‘leverage’ greater concessions from the UK on fishing rightsThat triggered open season on bashing Macron. In June came a perfect storm: those spending stories, provocative statements and idiosyncratic social media postings that seemed to affirm the view of him as someone who didn’t give a damn what others thought.Macron retweeted a video of himself almost shouting in exasperation at Elysee Palace staff. For too long France had ‘spent loads of dosh’ on social benefits, he complained in the footage.This prompted prominent Leftist Benoit Hamon — the defeated Socialist presidential candidate — to remark: ‘When you look at how he talks about the least well-off people . . . Macronism is a form of social racism.’That same month a clip of Macron publicly reprimanding a schoolboy for not referring to him as ‘Sir’ or ‘Mr President’ went viral. It recalled a similar incident during the presidential campaign when a striking worker accused him of being a ‘man in a suit’. Macron snapped back: ‘The best way to pay for a suit is to get a job.’At the time, Macron was requesting a new swimming pool for his official retreat on an island off the Riviera — and let’s not forget the 1,200 new state banqueting plates at a cost of £44,000 allegedly ordered by the Macrons.July brought France’s football World Cup triumph in Moscow and an opportunity to try to regain his popularity. A photo of him in the VIP box in the Moscow stadium after Les Bleus opened the scoring in the final appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the globe. Feet apart, head thrown back, fists punching the sky, it was a rock star moment.Macron was then seen planting kisses on the heads of the victorious French team and ‘dabbing’ — a popular street dance style — with them. Not everyone back home was impressed by a leader known to have little interest in the game.    Yesterday, Theresa May rounded on Macron, saying he was wrong to suggest he could use ‘leverage’ to prevent the UK taking back control of its fishing groundsAnd within days, Macron was embroiled in a serious scandal. His deputy chief of staff and security adviser Alexandre Benalla had been secretly suspended for physically attacking anti-Macron demonstrators at a May Day rally. When opposition MPs asked why the incident was hushed up, Benalla was finally dismissed. The President’s approval ratings continued to fall.In September, one of Macron’s MPs resigned from his party, saying she felt as if she was ‘on the Titanic’, while a string of cabinet ministers have followed in recent months, including Interior Minister Gérard Collomb and Environment Minister Nicolas Hulot, who quit live on TV with no warning.Then came the yellow vest revolt when on November 17 almost 300,000 demonstrators, led by a Facebook campaign, threw up roadblocks across France. Toll stations were burned, tempers ran high and the two fatalities occurred when drivers panicked or tried to escape from the roadblock chaos.Le Figaro described it as ‘the yokels against the bobos’ — the yuppies. While white-collar Parisians have little use for cars, in provincial France private motor transport is a necessity of life.What’s more, much of it is diesel-powered — the most ecologically unfriendly fuel and much frowned-upon by Macron and his supporters. His insistence on a punitive hike in taxes at the French petrol pump in January — by 6.5 cents per litre for diesel and 2.9 cents for petrol — is being viewed as another example of his disdain for low-income and rural drivers.Anecdotal evidence suggests the yellow vests are largely non-partisan, united only by their fury at Macron and his policies. And, as last weekend’s events suggest, that fury shows no sign of abating.Right now, Jupiter needs to use every trick — however fishy — if he is to stay in charge.Additional reporting: Peter Allen in Paris"},{"url":null,"title":"Seven foot boa constrictor digs teeth owners hand refuses let go","story":"    The man dangles a rabbit by the snake but the boa bites into his hand instead of the food\u0027I have an alligator in my backyard!\u0027 Snake catcher shares...Man, 40, is rushed to hospital in a serious condition after...Share this articleSnow quickly strikes at her owner, making him swear as she digs her teeth into his hand.Despite the snake\u0027s teeth being deep in his flesh the man can be seen smiling  and using his other hand to hold Snow.The person recording the video says \u0027she isn\u0027t going to let go now\u0027 as the man does a thumbs up for the camera.After a few seconds the man says \u0027I\u0027m going to have to play dead now aren\u0027t I.\u0027          Snow the boa refuses to let go for around a minute and digs her sharp teeth into the man          His hand is left bleeding after dinner time goes wrong but he keeps smiling for the cameraHe wriggles his fingers and blood can be seen coming from the bite marks, all the while the snake is still attached to his hand.Just as the woman recording asks if he needs her help to try and remove Snow, the snake\u0027s grip loosens and the man is free. Despite his injury, the man then dangles the rabbit again to get Snow back into her cage and this time she goes for the rabbit. The person filming asks the man \u0027did you get any teeth in there?\u0027 before he walks off. "},{"url":null,"title":"First time hang glider clings dear life pilot FORGOT attach craft","story":"    Youtuber Chris Gursky (Gursk3) (left) holds onto the pilot as they prepare to take off but he isn\u0027t attached  Chris slipped soon after the pair took off in Switzerland and had to cling on to a metal bar           Chris showed \u0027superman\u0027 strength as he gripped onto the bar according to those who watched          Homes, trees and hard ground were all that were in sight for Mr Gursky to land on if he fellTerrifying CCTV captures five burglars staking out a home...Man sneaks into an empty water park and impressively rides...Share this articleSeconds after Chris, who is wearing a checked shirt and white helmet, and the pilot took off they realise that he is not attached.Chris tightly grips a metal bar with his left hand in the video and holds onto the instructors back with his right as they glide over trees and fields.The pilot tries his best to bring them down but is having trouble controlling the glider.As they fly over more trees the craft goes higher and the pilot desperately grabs onto his passenger with his left hand.           They glide through the air but the first-time glider has to cling onto a metal bar for the flight          Mr Gursky\u0027s wife Gail was away gliding over the scenic Swiss Alps while her husband was holding tight to a pilot          Soon after take-off Chris was dangling on for dear life as the pilot attempted to hold him up          The men rise higher before the pilot gets the glider under control and starts to head down to the ground.

The pilot appeared to be looking for the best place to land as quickly as possible as Chris clung to his leg\u0027I remember looking down and thinking, this is it. I was losing grip with my right hand, that was holding onto a strap on the pilot\u0027s right shoulder. He was trying to make a bee line to the landing field as he knew what the situation could bring.\u0027My left hand was on the cross bar that was ultimately the landing gear, with a wheel on each side. As we were going down for a hot landing I was slowly losing my grip with my right hand as I was swinging in the wind with the glider.\u0027The pilot grabbed my hand, but like in the movies it was a slow motion slipping of the grip until my right hand slipped off and I grabbed another strap on his left side for a bit but this slipped off also.\u0027I ended up holding on bar with the left hand and the lower part of his leg with the right when we were nearing the ground. I looked down to see my feet hit first, which ripped me off at about 45 mph as it was a hot landing and I was under the landing gear.\u0027I would guesstimate the total flight time was about 5 minutes.

Along with flying cars, rocket-fuelled monorails and supersonic passenger aircraft, it is one of the great “what ifs?” technologies. It was supposed to transform our cities, but never quite caught on – outside Asia at least.In the past few years, though, a new generation of engineers have been quietly developing cheaper and more efficient maglev systems, some reaching eye-watering speeds of 500kmh (370 miles per hour) and above. And with the “hyperloop” projects promoted by Elon Musk essentially maglev trains in a vacuum, the technology’s supporters believe it might just get another chance.The world’s first commercial maglev opened in 1984 in Birmingham. Developed by British Rail, this floating capsule out to the airport was technologically miles ahead of anything in the world at the time.A generation of travellers enjoyed the smooth, futuristic ride over the top of sprawling car parks, a police station and a dual carriageway until high maintenance costs saw it shut down 11 years later. The revolutionary carriages ended up dumped in a hedge a few miles from the runway before eventually being sold on eBay.Germany embraced maglev technology too. A company called Transrapid was commissioned to build a maglev system from Munich to its airport, replacing the glacially slow S-Bahn, but the project was iced when estimated costs almost doubled to €3bn.Berlin briefly had a slow-speed maglev, and cities as varied as Timișoara, Vancouver and Moscow developed their own vehicles and tested them – but none of these entered full service. Moscow’s TA-05 in particular was a curvaceous classic with a kitsch design that was even featured in a Soviet sci-fi film.Slow-speed maglevs also ran in Hamburg and Kassel in Germany – often as short-lived exhibition gimmicks.Europe’s high-speed maglev dream ended in 2006 after 23 people were killed when a maglev train on Transrapid’s test track in Emsland, Germany, hit a maintenance vehicle. A few years earlier Transrapid had developed the fastest passenger train in service in the world – the Shanghai maglev, which still runs to Pudong airport at speeds of 431kmh – but it never won another contract after the Emsland crash. The test track stands idle.Europe now prefers high-speed trains with wheels. France has laid more than 2,600km of high-speed track and Spain more than 3,200km, with the fastest European trains running at over 320kmh.Britain briefly mulled over the Ultraspeed proposal for a 500kmh £30bn London to Scotland maglev in 2005, but instead opted for the high-speed HS2 rail line. HS2 is now estimated to cost £56bn to build and will see trains running at up to 360kmh.Across the Atlantic, a maglev from Pittsburgh airport to Greensburg was considered in the mid-1990s, and a proposed Pittsburgh-to-Philadelphia maglev was cancelled in 2011. Orlando almost had a maglev moment in 2012, but balked. San Diego had a test track and considered building a longer one to connect to a new city airport in 2005. All these ventures were abandoned on cost grounds.It is the cities of Asia that have embraced maglev in the 21st century. Shanghai’s high-speed maglev is the fastest commercial high-speed electric train in the world, while in Japan, the under-construction Tokyo-to-Osaka maglev will trump everyone with speeds of 500kmph when it opens in 2037, cutting the journey time from four hours by bullet train to 40 minutes.Lower-speed maglevs include the new Beijing line, an 8km route in Qingyuan scheduled to open in September and others in Changsha and Seoul.Dozens of Chinese cities – including Chengdu, Shenzhen, Wuhan and Guangzhou – are considering new maglevs. Systems have been proposed recently in Bangalore, Hong Kong and Taipei.There is also one US project left on the drawing board – a maglev to run the short distance between Baltimore and Washington DC, cities that could almost be twins were it not for the nightmare traffic between them at rush hour. If a maglev is built anywhere in the US, it will be there.Meanwhile, as Silicon Valley showoffs blow big budgets on madcap marketing campaigns and comical launches, scientists working on maglev continue to plug away quietly.Sergey Smirnov organised this year’s biennial conference for maglev engineers, entrepreneurs and enthusiasts in St Petersburg. Instead of TED talk-style pomp and free coconut lattes, the event was opened with a choir and closed with a boat ride down the Neva as a white-suited band played jazz standards. It all seemed strangely anachronistic for such a futuristic technology.“For decades maglev couldn’t offer a better product in terms of price and efficiency than high-speed rail,” says Smirnov, an engineer himself. “Now, thanks to the work of many scientists and engineers, maglev offers speeds much higher than trains with wheels and has the lowest operation costs of any transport.”The technology is also incredibly energy-efficient and has a very low impact on the environment.After 30 years promoting maglev systems in the US, the former Transrapid engineer Larry Blow is optimistic for their future. “As more and more people experience the differences in speed, noise, ride comfort and safety that are features of maglev, I feel confident it will become more popular around the world,” he says.Maybe the magnetic attractions of maglev will sway more cities in the coming years.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35fdab024946cd5e5a56d3084ddc98cc299839b1/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11818f2988e8dcb40031c19d744a69ab","title":"airbnb city bikes sharing economy big money","story":"To flourish, the informal digital networks providing new services needed to be protected from the marketOf all the ideologies spawned by Silicon Valley, that of techno-populism – the making of empty promises on the basis of seismic digital disruption – is the strangest. Promising a world of immediate and painless personal empowerment, techno-populism is ambiguous enough to unite big tech firms, startups, cryptocurrency aficionados and even some political parties.The history is murky, but we do know the date when it went mainstream. It can be traced to Time magazine’s selection, in 2006, of “You” – the millions of ordinary people behind the user-generated web of the 2000s – as its Person of the Year. That choice ingrained techno-populist themes deep into our collective unconscious.While actual contributors to sites such as Wikipedia or Flickr were relatively few, the celebration of them delayed and deflected questions about corporate power and the durability of the emerging digital utopia. Just a few years later, that utopia was no more: highly centralised and dominated by a handful of platforms, the web was a shadow of its former eccentric self.In 2018, the omnipotent creative user of 2006 has become a zombie-like content junkie, lethally addicted to scrolling and liking, forever trapped in the invisible cages of data brokers. A noble effort to make everyone an honorary member of the Bloomsbury group has instead condemned all of us to the eternal rosters of Cambridge Analytica.So the myth of the user-as-an-artist is gone. But today the spirit of techno-populism thrives on two subsequent equally potent myths: those of the user-as-entrepreneur and the user-as-consumer. They promise a lot – more decentralisation, efficiency, informality – while concealing the actual dynamics of the digital economy. As a result, the digital future that does await us – one of centralisation, inefficiency and control – is harder to discern.When Uber, Airbnb and similar platforms were young and tiny, it was easy to believe that a global revolution would liberate more informal economic activity. Out with professional drivers, limousines and hotels in with amateurs, bicycles and shared couches!It was an appealing vision, rooted in the countercultural rebellion against authority, hierarchy and expertise. That vision, however, lacked one thing: backing from political parties or social movements. Those parties, once in power, could have ensured that local platforms had adequate public funding not to be subject to the brutal laws of competition, protecting them from deep-pocketed commercial competitors.A similar effort in the previous century, a political project par excellence, gave us the welfare state. Instead of opening the provision of education or healthcare services to private providers, we deliberately sealed those domains from the pressures of the market.The welfare state that emerged had some hierarchical excesses, but it was a reasonable compromise, given the political and technological limitations of that era. Today, one can imagine a more horizontal provision of such services, more respectful of local autonomy, democratic decision-making and inidual idiosyncrasies. The same goes for the economy as a whole.Digital platforms, as intermediaries of interaction between citizens and firms, and also citizens and institutions, should be of great importance to this transformation. However, no similar political project – aimed at keeping the newly democratised state and economy decommodified – emerged. As a result, the laudable aims of empowerment, localism and horizontalism were to be achieved by cosying up to a mighty but treacherous ally – by synchronising the heartbeat and needs of digital platforms with those of global capital.It worked nicely, at least in the beginning. Car-sharing, bike-sharing and flat-sharing all exploded, thanks to huge injections of capital, much of it from sovereign wealth funds and venture capitalists. How nice it was of Saudi Arabia to pour its oil revenues – through deals with Japan’s SoftBank – into subsidising ride-sharing and food delivery all over the world.Those offering services or goods on digital platforms, as well as those buying or renting them, had reasons for jubilation. The former got a way to monetise their idle resources, from vacant apartments to free time. The latter got discounts on rides, meals and bookings. Many struggling municipalities could now count on digital platforms to extend or replace crumbling infrastructure and facilitate tourism.This fairytale has come to an end. The year 2018 is to the sharing economy what 2006 was to user-generated content: it can only go downhill. Platforms won’t disappear far from it. However, the initial lofty objectives that legitimised their activities will give way to the prosaic and occasionally violent imperative imposed by the iron law of competition: the quest for profitability.Uber may help some make ends meet through occasional driving gigs. The need to achieve profitability, however, means that it will have no qualms about ditching its drivers for fully automated vehicles a company that lost $4.5 bn in 2017 alone would be silly to do otherwise.Airbnb may have presented itself as an ally of the middle classes against entrenched economic interests. But the drive for profits already forces it to partner with the likes of Brookfield Property Partners, one of the world’s largest real-estate firms, to develop Airbnb-branded hotel-like residencies, often by purchasing and converting existing apartment blocks. Few entrenched interests – save, perhaps, for the tenants who see their apartment blocks become Airbnb-run hotels – get disrupted here.Given the huge sums involved, the most likely outcome of current battles in sectors such as ride-sharing will be more centralisation, with just one or two platforms controlling each region. Uber’s surrender – in China, India and Russia, as well as much of southeast Asia and Latin America – to local players, many of them also backed by Saudi money, suggests as much.And the old and hierarchical industries will not stay idle for ever, as the experience of the previous digital revolution teaches us. Just look at the recent acquisition of Spin – a promising electronic scooter startup – by Ford.Such developments contradict the techno-populist rhetoric. They also generate a lot of waste, with piles of abandoned bikes proliferating across the globe. Increased traffic on clogged streets – the consequence of letting global capital conquer ride-sharing instead of developing far more efficient public transportation – is already here.Mountains of waste generated by delivery startups is hardly the sustainable future advertised by techno-populists. The heavily subsidised fares and meal prices – the temporary consequence of intense competition – will not last heavy losses will need to be recouped by the few winning firms – most likely, via higher prices.Today’s myth of the omnipotent consumer-entrepreneur is dead. Techno-populism, however, will survive, making sweeping promises about the blockchain, artificial intelligence or the smart city.Many of these promises will look appealing. But without a robust political agenda – an agenda that harbours no illusions about the ability of global capital to promote social emancipation – they will produce the opposite effects. We can’t buy our way to a more democratic society – and certainly not with Saudi money.• Evgeny Morozov is the author of To Save Everything, Click Here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcc754e41aaa339e8d1cce0db370c5a9df5c8cf0/0_459_3326_1995/master/3326.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1715047c255d3a6b5a67504fafcda78","title":"nick cave red hand files","story":"The songwriter’s one-to-one online correspondence with his fans is contemplative, compassionate and touching. Tim Berners-Lee would be proudSomething curious is happening on the world wide web. Intimacy. And not of the more sordid kind with which you might commonly associate it.In September the Australian songwriter Nick Cave told email subscribers of his plan to communicate outside “some of the more conventional ways of getting information across”. It followed the “Conversations with Nick Cave” events this year in the US and Ireland where, inspired by his 2017 world tour with the Bad Seeds, he explored a more direct relationship with his audience by just talking with them. The success of those gatherings has led to 10 more dates in Australia and New Zealand next year. Cave wanted to deepen further this engagement and so invited “questions or comments, observations or inspirations” from fans and he’d answer in a series of mail drops titled The Red Hand Files.“You can ask me anything,” he told readers. “Like the Conversations with events there will be no moderator. This will be between you and me. Let’s see what happens.”So far, so honest. But he goes further: “We all needed to draw ourselves back to a state of wonder. My way was to write myself there … but I also realised that I was not alone in my grief and that many of you were, in one way or another, suffering your own sorrows, your own griefs. I felt this in our live performances. I felt very acutely that a sense of suffering was the connective tissue that held us all together.” And he touches directly on his loss: “I have found a way to write beyond the trauma, authentically, that deals with all manner of issues but does not turn its back on the issue of the death of my child.”The message’s confessional tone is affecting, a letter rather than an email. In subsequent notes Cave discusses family pets, the illusive nature of lyrics, his bond with collaborator Warren Ellis, absent friends, Grinderman, monsters under the bed, and the creative impulse. (“I have rarely sat down at my desk with something to say, other than I am ready. The sitting comes first.”)With more than 1,000 questions received, Cave has now dispatched 10 Red Hand Files since 14 September. Some are shorter than others. This month, for instance, he was asked: “If somebody told you that the world was going to end in the next, let’s say, 72 hours, what would you do in those 72 hours?” To which, with a most Australian brevity, Cave replied: “I’d freak the fuck out. Love, Nick.”A fan who has lost her father and sister but found first love asks about communication with them through dreams. Cave replies: “Grief is the terrible reminder of the depths of our love and, like love, grief is non-negotiable … I feel the presence of my son, all around, but he may not be there.”There’s much to ponder and revisit, while the collection continues to grow. Like postcards from an old friend, they invite us to pause, look up and savour life. In a BBC profile last month, AN Wilson implored viewers to revisit the verse of TS Eliot, arguing that the poet’s themes of time and memory and belief are as relevant now as when written in the 20th century. He’s right, and similarly the letters from Cave bring solace in a tumultuous age, and perhaps also decades from now.Reading the Red Hand Files brings a sense of Easter revival, of hope amid despair, inviting us to be still, be present in the moment, guided by a suited and booted vicar. While Donald Trump stirs ferment and craves adulation at his rallies, and Britain tears itself apart in a messy orce, the quiet reflections of Cave spread peace and compassion and love through a medium renowned for its ability to spread ision.In this growing treasure trove of letters to the world, he is showing how to use the web beyond the hubbub of social media, to engage in more reflective and rewarding conversations.

It is especially unpredictable because the battles to come will not run along party lines. Many MPs decided long ago that their Brexit choices transcended attachment to a red or blue rosette. They might have party whips on their backs, but they feel history’s eye on them more keenly.One Labour veteran, witness to many a parliamentary rebellion, describes loyalties in the Commons today as the most fluid since the repeal of the corn laws 172 years ago. That tussle over tariffs brought down a prime minister, split the Conservative party and created a new Liberal one.Today’s Tories look more ided than Labour, but that is because a governing party has to do Brexit, while the opposition only has to talk about it. May has made unpopular choices that Jeremy Corbyn pretends do not need making. Labour’s policy is to engineer a general election, win it, then cook up an alchemist Brexit that keeps the benefits of the single market without the obligations of EU membership. The unavailability of that combination has been proven many times.If Tory MPs cared only about party unity, they would rally behind May’s deal. Their goal would be to get over the finish line without sweating over the small print, mint the commemorative coins and change the subject – enjoying the respite of a transition period before too many people realised they had been diddled. But neither hardcore leavers nor remainers are prepared to play along. Tory Brexit ultras demand a new deal, knowing there is no time to get one. They are just flapping their arms in anticipation of a run at the no-deal cliff edge. But if that is the way things are heading, many pro-European Tories would take their chances on a referendum with a view to aborting Brexit altogether.For the hard-right Conservatives, Brexit is one stage in a still more radical project – a hybrid of Ukippish nationalism and deregulated market free-for-all. Tory moderates dream of rehabilitating their party’s one-nation tradition and its social conscience. May is still in office mainly because a leadership contest would prise that ideological schism open beyond repair. No Tory can name a candidate to unite the party many can think of someone whose victory would force them to quit.Corbyn has more job security than May, but it is built on a devoted membership, not a loyal parliamentary cohort. Even if Labour MPs vote en bloc against the Brexit deal it will be for ergent reasons. Some share the leader’s ambition to provoke a dissolution of parliament. Others dread a general election, but think it unlikely and expect party policy to switch to a second referendum as the next best thing. A third tranche is torn between the impulse to satisfy leave-voting constituents and hatred of May’s government. They want Brexit done, but will avoid throwing the prime minister a lifeline when the waters are closing over her head.If MPs reject the deal, there are seven possible paths the country could go down next.May brings it back to MPsPerhaps with minor tweaks after a dash to Brussels. ​MPs knuckle under and vote it through.May resigns immediatelyIt is\u0026nbsphard to imagine her surviving for long. After a rapid leadership contest, a different leader could appeal to a majority in parliament, perhaps by offering a softer deal.Tory backbenchers depose herJacob Rees-Mogg gets his way and there is a no-confidence vote. A new leader then tries to assemble a majority behind a tweaked deal.May calls a general electionMay could choose to take the ultimate gamble and hope that voters would back her deal, over the heads of squabbling MPs.Labour tries to force an electionThe opposition tables a vote of no confidence.\u0026nbsp​If May lost​,\u0026nbspthe opposition (or a new Conservative leader) would have two weeks to form an alternative government that could win a second confidence vote. If they were unable to do so, a general election would be triggered.A second referendum gathers supportThis is most likely if Labour makes a last-ditch decision to back it.\u0026nbspNo dealThe EU (Withdrawal) Act specifies 29 March 2019 as\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspday. Amber Rudd has said she believes parliament would stop a no deal, but it is not clear how it would do so.Corbyn himself does not seem naturally interested in Britain’s EU membership. His most commonly stated preference since the referendum has been to leave on terms that remove the UK from single market rules on competition and industrial subsidy (a pretty hard Brexit). But he is mindful that many of his supporters wish he would rally for remain. Corbyn’s ideal outcome would probably be to get Brexit with none of the blame for Brexit. So the Labour leadership has circled over May’s government like vultures, watching a wounded creature crawl across an arid plain. There are worse strategies. Scavenging is an effective evolutionary model, albeit not an inspiring one.Corbyn has reasons to avoid getting involved in the People’s Vote campaign. It would put him in public alliance with liberal Tories and Blairites, the kind of people with whom he does not share platforms (including the actual Tony Blair). The opposition leader’s team also suspects the People’s Vote movement of incubating a new party and sees no value in political insurgencies outside Labour’s control.That isn’t entirely paranoid. There are Labour MPs who want a referendum but would not be too disappointed if their leader were to be seen to obstruct one. That decision would give moderate rebels a cause to break with the party on terms that might carry some sympathy with the membership. For Corbyn to be exposed as unequivocally pro-Brexit would test the faith of all but his most dedicated acolytes. The remnants of pre-2015 Labour would fall away and the party, for better or worse, would emerge purely Corbynite.What form that rupture takes is unclear. Volatility shakes up old allegiances but it doesn’t remove all obstacles to the establishment of new parties. The electoral system still punishes political startup ventures. A craving for different leadership doesn’t conjure ideal leaders into being. And the call of the tribe should never be underestimated. In an election, many MPs who claim now to have floating loyalties would drift back to their original side.Many, but not all. Much depends on how long the turbulence lasts and how extreme it gets. England’s two main parties are sailing into a rare constitutional hurricane and it isn’t clear whether their vessels are sound. All manner of things will be thrown overboard – policies, MPs, leaders. Some will jump before they are pushed. The parties that emerge on the other side of this storm will not be the same ones we have now, even if they sail under familiar names and colours."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0aa1eb0c57f3340026d01bf06500b4f694d847bb/1532_783_2982_1790/master/2982.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3581014564635ca76f73be99cf291fb5","title":"royal northern college of music first to appoint lecturer in wellbeing","story":"Royal Northern College of Music aims to help students deal with career pressuresThe Royal Northern College of Music has become the first conservatoire to appoint a lecturer in musicians’ health and wellbeing, to help equip students to deal with the pressures of a career in music.The number of students reporting mental health concerns has risen sharply across higher education in recent years, and the RNCM is concerned its students have to deal with the additional pressure of concerts and recitals as well as long hours of practice.Sara Ascenso, a clinical psychologist and trained pianist, will start at the college in January. Her role will include lecturing and research, and she will also develop the health and wellbeing provision across the college, ensuring it is tailored to musicians’ needs.Kathy Hart, the RNCM students’ union president, said many students had gone through more than a decade of dedication, sacrifice and hard work to win their place at the college.“When I talk to friends, I see that the work needed to build such a difficult career can come at a price, both physically and psychologically,” she said.“Like athletes, we must keep in peak condition to make the most of the opportunities we have fought so hard for. The more work we put in, the higher the stakes become – and the more devastating the impact if we are held back by injury or mental health struggles.”The Manchester college plans to lay on extra counselling sessions for students, particularly when performance pressures are at their peak, plus wellbeing activities such as yoga to help prevent injury. The RNCM also intends to extend its community outreach so more students get to work with people in need.Ascenso said: “We want our students to learn how to make music with excellence, but also how to live fulfilling lives as musicians and as human beings more generally.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4834b92f4590468e32cd876fb11a6c24e7185df4/0_221_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9156cf89eed40de89181384c80b8ee4","title":"bbc headteacher resigned tv james pope school","story":"Now viewers can see for themselves what cuts are doing, says James Pope from BBC2’s School seriesJames Pope has not been watching School, the BBC2 documentary he stars in. “I was hugely nervous. You don’t know how people will view you. Despite four years of generally very positive feedback from my line managers, governors, the trust and community, I thought there was a risk people would watch it and go: what an idiot.”The series follows the pupils, teachers, parents and leaders of different secondary schools in a multi-academy trust across the 2017-2018 academic year. It shows Pope struggling to improve standards at Marlwood, a rural secondary modern in Gloucestershire that has been put into special measures by Ofsted, while simultaneously being expected to cut nearly £1m from his annual budget. Teaching, leadership and support staff numbers are decimated, class sizes are increased, morale falls pupils and teachers struggle to shake off the label “inadequate”. Last week, in episode three, after a poor Ofsted report, Pope is seen handing in his resignation. He says the resultant outpouring of empathy from headteachers has been remarkable.“I started my headship with a vision of what I wanted to achieve and I came to realise that increasingly, I was making compromises,” he says. “And the more you have to compromise, the more you sit there thinking: this isn’t what I wanted to do. This isn’t what I thought my headship would be about.”Initially, the cuts reflected a shrinking population in Marlwood’s rural catchment area. But Pope, who has 21 years’ experience as a teacher, says the financial pressure was compounded by the “unfair” cuts being levied  on all schools by the government. “On top of the savings we were having to make uniquely at Marlwood, you pile the cuts in real terms that all schools are having to deal with …” He shakes his head. “It’s not right.”Poor Ofsted reports made the situation worse, putting parents and teachers off the school despite improvements in exam results under Pope, leading to even fewer pupils, stressed staff and further cuts. “I had to explain to parents: you don’t get anything special if you’re put in special measures. There is no more money. You don’t get any additional support or resources. In my experience, all you get is additional scrutiny and additional pressure.”He began working 14-hour days, getting up at 5am and returning home at 9pm, only to carry on working. A father of four children aged three to 13, he found it difficult to switch off. “It ended up becoming all consuming. I’d be doing something nice with my family and in the back of my mind I’d be thinking: well, if I did this or that, I might just save another £50,000.”He describes making cuts while at the same time trying to impress Ofsted as like “stepping into the ring with Mike Tyson, and somebody’s tied one arm behind your back”. Inspectors did not seem to take into account the financial and cultural challenges the school was going through. “I needed more understanding of our context and of the difficulties we faced, and more time to actually make the changes that were necessary.”What stressed him out the most was knowing the impact the cuts were having on his pupils. “It’s not so much the financial pressure that got to me. It’s that it stopped me doing the educational stuff I wanted to do. You have these conversations: Can we do that? No, we can’t afford it. Can we put that in place? No, we can’t afford it. So you just end up compromising all of the time to try and get the best out of what you have got.”The lack of support his academy trust received from the Department for Education appalled him. “Like lots of schools up and down the country, we’d written to the DfE about funding and campaigned collectively as a trust. But it’s easy for that to be swatted away with a line about how education funding has not been cut.”That is why he let the cameras in: to give his community an insight into the problems the school was dealing with, while making it harder for the DfE to explain away what viewers saw with their own eyes. “There is now very real evidence of the challenges we were facing. And judging from the number of people who have been in touch to say ‘that’s what my school is like’, what’s been happening at Marlwood is not unique.”He has started a blog about his experiences. “I want to use what is a fairly unique opportunity for me, thanks to the TV series, to ask some questions about what special measures means,” he says.After leaving Marlwood, Pope set up a consultancy, Inspire Educate, and hopes to use his experiences to help other school leaders.Today he looks years younger than on TV, and seems a lot happier. What made him finally decide to go? “Ultimately, there was one compromise too many. I felt as if I was in a position at many points last year where I just could not win, because of a financial situation nobody appeared able to help us to solve. And then I reached a point where I thought: you know what? I am fed up with compromising. These children are the future of this country. Are we prepared, as a society, to invest in our young people – or not?”School is a six-part series at 9pm on Tuesdays on BBC2"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9261d312f0a39fa07481f3b03d53ac314b97b0c0/1250_1655_3144_1887/master/3144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7cd807a20949483f025c1856269f68cb","title":"fruit and veg used in scheme for english schools often inedible","story":"Produce frequently low quality and with higher pesticide residues than food in shopsFruit and vegetables given to children under a government scheme are largely imported, often of poor quality and have higher levels of pesticide residues than supermarket equivalents, a report has revealed.Children’s health campaigners are urging the government to revamp the £40m school fruit and vegetable scheme, saying it is a waste of taxpayers’ money and is failing in its mission to encourage young people to eat more fresh produce.Under the initiative, all children aged four to six attending a state school in England are eligible for a free piece of fruit or veg at school each day. But the report on children’s food in England published on Tuesday by the Soil Association reveals that the produce is largely imported rather than grown in the UK, and often of poor quality or inedible, leading to high levels of food waste.“The scheme is broken,” said Rob Percival, the head of policy at the Soil Association. “Children are being presented with produce so lacking in flavour and texture that it is teaching them to actively dislike – or at least distrust – fruit and veg. “This government scheme is having an entirely counter-productive effect. This is a missed opportunity and a waste of taxpayers’ money.”An estimated 2 million children attending 18,000 schools in England benefit from the scheme – funded by the Department of Health since 2004 – and the report acknowledges it is an “important investment” in child health. But teachers involved in the research were highly critical of the quality of the produce provided, describing it as lacking in freshness, far from tasty and frequently inedible.“Pears are under-ripe and hard, carrots have been sweating in bags for days. Generally, the produce is not as fresh as we would hope, and this means the children don’t eat it,” one teacher told the organic food and farming organisation.The association is urging the government to “re-specify” the scheme so that a higher proportion of the produce is British, local and organic, and therefore fresher, tastier, of known provenance and more enjoyable for children. The scheme is administered through an annual government contract currently with Foodbuy, part of the Compass catering group.“Fruit and vegetables supplied through the school fruit and vegetable scheme follow the same safety and quality legislation as all other fruit and vegetables supplied for consumption in the UK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c44b13dadf80262817dd8f0966f60dfc27b5490/0_137_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7d3cef11d87751020e00df66542a8bb","title":"university education pay gap women england","story":"Female graduates earn similar wages to men without degrees, new figures showFemale graduates earn little more than many men of the same age without degrees, according to official data that shows even superior qualifications are not enough to catapult women across the pay gap.The graduate pay figures, collected from tax data by the Department for Education and analysed by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, cast a new light on who gains most from attending university in England, at a time of debate about higher education’s value for money.The new study is the first to compare the rewards of a university education with the earnings of non-graduate workers of the same age and with similar school-level attainment. The IFS’s Jack Britton said that in terms of employment, women had the most to gain from a degree because those without a degree received far less pay than men without one.“For women, going to university is a very good investment, for men it’s less clear – there are a large class of men doing courses that have zero or negative monetary value, so it’s a question for them of if it’s worth doing,” Britton said.The figures confirm the huge variations in earnings between graduates of different subjects and institutions. While medicine and economics offer the biggest potential pay boost, graduates in subjects such as creative arts and English have lower incomes than they would if they had avoided university.Sam Gyimah, the higher education minister, used the figures to celebrate the benefits of universities in England while telling some institutions that they risked regulation by the Office for Students.Asked if it was realistic to punish universities today for the careers of students who graduated a decade earlier, Gyimah said: “Yes, the data is from 10 years ago, but I have been careful to highlight that it is one of a number of indicators that we look at, it’s not the only indicator.“I think it is pretty serious if there is a course that 10 years ago did not deliver value, and that course is still being put on for future and prospective graduates to take. I think the intervention should be swift in that case.”The IFS analysts noted that people who went to university usually had better school-level exam results and came from richer families, and so would be expected to have more lucrative careers and higher earnings in any case.The figures are derived from longitudinal observations following people who took GCSE exams between 2002-07 up to the age of 29. The study included graduates from 140 higher education institutions in 30 subject areas.Although women receive a much larger uplift in their earnings after completing a university degree, the statistic is flattered by the much lower pay that non-graduate women receive.Male graduates were earning on average £37,000 by the age of 29.In recent years some commentators have been alarmed by the gap between men and women taking undergraduate degrees in the UK, with the participation rate of women now 10 percentage points higher than that of men by the age of 19.The authors said differences in earnings could be the result of “unobservable traits” such as soft skills, while incomes could also be affected by market demand. Hours worked, students loans and the non-monetary benefits of higher education were also not taken into account.Nicola Dandridge, the chief executive of the Office for Students, said better financial prospects were only one reason why people in England went to university. “But universities should scrutinise this data carefully, and some will need to ask themselves tough questions about how well they are preparing students for life after graduation,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3d5f615d82f4c499570e41b8f03eb985ef96427/0_64_1081_648/master/1081.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1ff9cb94fe29b83b2d4a3c11e9cdf4e","title":"party time mother of pearl sustainable eveningwear is an ethical alternative","story":" Evening dressing shouldn’t be a one-night stand, says designer Amy Powney. It should be easily adaptable to myriad occasionsWith the numbers of women wanting to know that the brands they are buying are environmentally friendly on a sharp incline, it’s safe to say that ‘tis the season to be mindful when it comes to your party dressing. Cue Amy Powney’s 22-piece eveningwear capsule collection for Mother of Pearl.London-based Powney is a rising star on the fashion scene and is known for her frank approach when it comes to sustainability, admitting that “fundamentally we all need to stop shopping”. She is also, however, respected for her realism and is one of a growing fleet of designers who promote the philosophy to “buy less and buy better”.As the creative director at MOP, she has made it her mission to equip herself with the research and knowledge that allows the brand to deliver sustainable and ethical collections that still have star appeal (Gwyneth Paltrow, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Laura Jackson are fans). To create her new eveningwear collection, she started to develop her own fabrics to dispel the notion of “hempy, hippy” clothes and “offer a more elevated product to show what can be done under a sustainable umbrella”.Her design ethos has always revolved around a day-to-night identity, which delivers fashion that can easily adapt to myriad occasions. It is a mood she has extended to the capsule collection, which comprises high-neck, asymmetric and bateau-neck dresses in black, beige, red and floral prints, strap tops, tailored trousers, coats and blazers. Featuring the brand’s signature dropped-shoulder and pearl-embellished ruching, Powney says the idea is to feel comfortable as well as special, reflecting the sentiment that “women have got to a point where they dress for themselves rather than onlookers”. To hit her message home, however, another shift in perception needs to happen in tandem.It’s the second step in MOP’s No Frills campaign, which saw Powney and her team spend the past three years drilling down on the brand’s supply chain so that they could start to understand what can be a very opaque and complex process.“I decided that we were going to work it out for ourselves, so we went and met with farmers and spinners and weavers to try to piece the supply chain together so we could see how it works, what the environmental and ethical impacts are along the way, what can we do to improve it and what fabric companies are legit and sustainable and who are not,” she says. As such, all her pieces, including the new capsule (with prices ranging from £350 to £995), are made from Italian fabrics in Portugal, and Powney has eyes on everything. Off the back of her findings, she is in the process of visiting publications and fashion houses to give them bitesize lessons on how to judge if a brand really is sustainable or is missing the point entirely.“Lots of people don’t understand what sustainability really means … it’s not just the factory where something is made … the biggest environmental impact happens before that, when it’s being grown or synthetically produced.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf36a5a1906b8d9658e5e0c4b8975d39be88866b/417_0_3583_2151/master/3583.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02963dfd1441fd97c5012575a101bb96","title":"roma alfonso cuaron oscar frontrunner triumph","story":"The Oscar-winning director’s dazzling Netflix-backed drama tells the story of a live-in nanny and domestic worker with nuance and depthRoma, Alfonso Cuarón’s first film since 2013’s Oscar-guzzling outer space spectacular Gravity, is by most measures a pretty major work. It won the Golden Lion at Venice after its premiere prompted a collective critical swoon, and it’s widely expected to become the first Spanish-language production to land an Oscar nomination for best picture. (Cuarón is currently the bookies’ favourite to take his second best director statuette.) Beyond such accolades, meanwhile, it’s a significant industry milestone on the business side of things: the first film ever to persuade Netflix to drop their hitherto stubborn day-and-date strategy and release it exclusively in cinemas first.You might expect a film with that level of clout to be some manner of blockbuster, though those who approach Roma on hype alone may be surprised by how exquisitely small it is: hefty in formal scope, yes, but finally an intimate, fine-boned character study as memory piece, built from vignettes and images that suggest an uncovered family album in gleaming monochrome. Loosely autobiographical, it’s a reflection on Cuarón’s middle-class upbringing in the Colonia Roma district of Mexico City amid the political tumult of the early 1970s, though Cuarón’s pre-teen proxy is a marginal presence: the protagonist and focal point here is Cleo, a young but prematurely world-weary woman who acts as the family’s live-in nanny and domestic worker.Taciturn, delicate but resilient, she’s regarded with adoring awe throughout by Cuarón’s limber camera. From the opening shots, lingering patiently over the soapy water Cleo uses to clean the family’s driveway, it’s clear that Roma is intended as a belated valentine to an unseen woman, treated with needy affection by employers who also take her casually for granted, rarely pausing to notice either the back-aching drudgery she endures for their sake or the shipshape domestic order left in its wake. In gazing upon that drudgery, framing it in meticulous black and white, Roma is nothing if not an act of noticing, paying its respects and attention most directly to its fictionalised subject with a closing dedication: “For Libo,” it says, doffing its cap to the Cuarón family’s longtime maid Liboria Rodríguez, whom the film-maker says he consulted extensively in the writing process.This is a world apart from the vision of domestic routine in a film such as Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles, which stresses the banality of housework to underscore a homemaker’s psychological unravelling. If Cleo finds her job dreary – and Roma doesn’t skimp on how thankless his blindly privileged family often made it for her – Cuarón’s cinematic thank-you letter effectively takes pride in it for her. This is a risky stance to take, particularly with a heroine already written as a naif of few words: Roma gives a disenfranchised woman a spotlight more than it does a voice, and it’s left to the soulful, jaded expressivity of the non-professional actor Yalitzia Aparicio in the lead to wrest some storytelling control from the film’s imposingly perfect mise-en-scene.If it took place in a vacuum of purely personal reference points, Roma could easily seem at once reverent and slightly condescending: a nostalgic beautification of an ugly facet of family history. Cuarón is a smarter film-maker than that, of course. As in his last Mexican film, 2001’s Y tu Mama También, a tender coming-of-age narrative is suffused with broader, brittler class politics, as the vast economic disparity between the country’s lighter-skinned haves and darker-skinned have-nots is denoted throughout – not least in the large, fashionably appointed family townhouse around which so much of the film’s action airily revolves. Cleo’s shabby servant’s quarters at the back, meanwhile, are pointedly shot from one outward-facing angle: there, the camera has no room to roam. Woman of the house Sofía may occasionally make magnanimous part-of-the-family gestures to Cleo, but the manifold enforced isions and differences between them are illustrated in, well, black and white. (Not to mention aurally: a less careful film wouldn’t differentiate between the subtitles –complete with introductory on-screen key – indicating the Spanish spoken by the family and the Mixtec dialect spoken by Cleo and her class peers.)Regardless of language, no one in Roma talks about politics. The family has the luxury of being able to ignore such concerns the illiterate Cleo, meanwhile, appears to be kept ignorant, even as the Corpus Christi massacre (ironically, a brutal response to students demonstrating for education reform) rages around her on a day of intense personal crisis. In this, the film’s most stunningly executed set piece, national affairs are pushed literally into the background, echoing the character’s own curtailed perspective. Is it in sympathy with her, too, that Roma keeps its political critique tacit – littering the film with evidence of her oppression but refraining from speaking for her in protest?Viewed from different angles, Roma becomes either a seething confession of middle-class guilt, a complacent declaration of love or, most believably and movingly, a conflicted mixture of the two. If we never quite get to hear what Cleo makes of her lot, that’s indicative of an entrenched social system that gives men like Cuarón greater powers and outlets of expression. If Roma is his magnum opus, it’s the beneficiary of multiple tiers of privilege, from his wealthy upbringing to the Hollywood success that enabled him to make this muscularly uncommercial personal project at all, much less see it given the full red-carpet treatment. (It’s not as if many of Roma’s most vocal champions are regular proponents of Mexican neo-realist cinema, after all.)It’s to Cuarón’s credit that he’s taken advantage of advantage, to turn the lens on a life that nobody in the industry was clamouring for the director of Gravity and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban to portray. But there are parts of Cleo, of Libo, that even this great film-maker cannot see. Stirring as both a labour of love and, perhaps, a whispered mea culpa, Roma is a film of exacting observation and equally precise blind spots – leaving space, one hopes, for the stories of Cleo and women like her to be told from other vantage points."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1918078651a63c376ffba8a6eef46f9d5de2349f/119_281_6936_4162/master/6936.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5a67a613f74a68932ab1750ea97d626","title":"thomasina miers recipe for crisp turkish duck leg","story":"This aromatic, spice-rubbed duck goes beautifully with the bitter-sweet flavours of radicchio, pomegranate and quinceDuck meat has always felt luxurious but, as I discovered at a recent Suffolk food festival, it needn’t be a luxury: you can buy duck legs for very little.

Newcastle have now taken nine points from their past three games to leave Burnley looking over their shoulder at signs of improvement in the sides below them.

It was a debatable own goal because the initial attempt may have been on target, but the goalkeeper probably had the shot covered before the Burnley captain’s intervention.Chris Wood had the best couple of chances as Burnley attempted to draw level. He could not keep his shot down from the first one, failing to properly get hold of a raking ball from Matt Lowton that reached him at the far post, though he did much better from a lot further out with his next effort, producing a 30-yard shot that almost caught Martin Dubravka by surprise.Just as Burnley were enjoying more of the game, however, Newcastle delighted their vociferous support by scoring again. Goals have not been plentiful for Newcastle this season, and even the most rabid supporters would have been expecting a Rafa Benítez side to sit on an early lead, at least until half-time, but midway through the first half the visitors again took advantage of hesitant defending at a corner.Ritchie played a one-two with Ki Sung-yueng before sending over a cross from the right that Ciaran Clark reached ahead of Mee to glance a header into Hart’s bottom-right corner. Both captains were therefore on the scoresheet before the half-hour stage, unfortunately for Mee and Burnley both in the same net.Defensive solidarity used to be a plank of Burnley’s survival platform, they would not allow opponents many scoring opportunities and worked on being well-drilled at dead-ball situations. This season they have been conceding goals at a rate of slightly more than two per game, and without making Newcastle work particularly hard put themselves at the same disadvantage with barely a quarter of the match gone.It says something for Burnley’s spirit that they did not give up trying at the other end. Mee made some amends for his earlier errors with the diagonal ball from halfway that allowed Sam Vokes to pull a goal back, though most of the credit should go to the striker for a masterful header from the edge of the area. It takes power and accuracy to score an aerial goal from that far out, but spotting that Dubravka was standing a few yards off his line Vokes directed his effort upwards and over him.Newcastle’s dismal record in Monday night Premier League matches kicking off at 8pm has come to an end after 10 losses – all away from homeThe keeper was in action again, beating away a fierce shot from Wood in the closing seconds of the half. Burnley had made a terrible start, though by half-time they were the side looking most likely to score next.For all that, the home side were allowed a scarcely believable reprieve at the start of the second half, when Ritchie managed to miss an open goal from a distance best measured in inches. DeAndre Yedlin made such inroads into the area after catching Robbie Brady napping he almost scored himself, but Hart managed to get a boot in the way and the ball rolled across the face of goal. Arriving at speed from the left Ritchie seemed certain to score, yet although a tap-in was all that was required he shot into the side-netting.Newcastle spurned another opportunity to make the game safe 10 minutes from time, when Joselu ghosted behind the defence to reach Ayoze Pérez’s inspired pass, only to crash his shot against an upright.Vokes and Wood went close for Burnley before the end, but with a little more composure in front of goal Newcastle could have been looking at a handsome Monday night victory. “I didn’t see what happened with the Ritchie miss, I still need to see the replay, but we could laugh about it at the end,” Benítez said. “It was a pity we could not get a third goal but we took three points from a good side. We are a lot happier about our situation now we are winning again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/091b8629fd632a67b60eb96f6d6e8223c60d29c5/0_132_2300_1380/master/2300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=031ca29c5fe501eca041b2e6ed65f8ae","title":"luke shaw jose mourinho manchester united champions league young boys","story":"Luke Shaw has acknowledged that anyone playing for José Mourinho requires a “thick skin” but believes Manchester United’s squad now need to “fight for this manager and this club”.As if to prove his left-back’s point, Mourinho responded by declaring that any player feeling cowed by the pressure of performing in front of 75,000 fans at Old Trafford would be better off staying at home and watching Tuesday night’s Champions League group game against Young Boys on television.If a much altered dynamic between Shaw and his manager has seen their relationship move from the point of apparently irreparable breakdown to a state of seemingly mutual trust, it has proved a rare positive at Old Trafford this season.After all, United welcome Young Boys for what, in theory, should be a fairly routine victory having won only three of their nine home matches in all competitions this term.Such setbacks have not only left them a modest seventh in the Premier League but, in recent days, prompted Burnley’s Sean Dyche to suggest Mourinho’s players are not immune from relegation worries while David Moyes on Monday claimed he should have been given more time in charge at Old Trafford after succeeding Sir Alex Ferguson.Although victory against Young Boys will guarantee United’s passage to the knockout stage – providing Juventus avoid defeat by Valencia – Mourinho’s side failed to score in recent home European games against Valencia and Juve, and Shaw conceded they are feeling the heat.“You need a thick skin to play under this manager and for this club,” he said. “But we need to fight for this manager, the team and the club. Everyone in the changing room is a fighter and we want the best for the team and the club.”Just as a prime minister or president facing difficulties in the domestic sphere often tends to look for erting glory on the foreign-policy front, Mourinho is clearly hoping that Champions League success can help gloss over his team’s Premier League travails.On the road in Europe his team have generally done well, most notably winning away at Juventus but also prevailing 3-0 at bottom-placed Young Boys in Berne, yet the Portuguese demurred when asked if United are happier playing away.Mourinho has, however, felt stress en route to Old Trafford in recent weeks, with the Manchester traffic on more than one occasion causing his team to arrive late for games. That peril should be avoided on Tuesday by United having switched pre-match bases to a hotel much closer to the ground. “Things are going to be much better,” he said. “And if they aren’t, we’ll walk.”Midfield has proved a particularly weak link of late, with Saturday’s disappointing 0-0 draw at home to Crystal Palace a case in point, and Mourinho – who cannot currently seem to find a starting place for Fred, his £52m summer signing from Shakhtar Donetsk – is hoping Pogba and company start winning some second balls on Tuesday night. “Normally we are not very good at second balls,” said United’s manager pointedly and presumably laying down a gauntlet. “Our midfield is not normally that aggressive in the fight for second balls. You need that aggression and intensity in the midfield, which, to be honest, we don’t have.”Mourinho’s woes were further compounded when he confirmed that his much improved and increasingly influential Sweden defender Victor Lindelöf will be absent because of a muscle injury – almost certainly his thigh – and could also be sidelined over the impending festive period.“He will be out for quite a while,” said United’s manager. “Victor has a proper injury. If we can have Victor available for the Christmas period it will be good.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ebe8920876c9fed86e9f7f2c5ad9e7fac9e954e/63_0_1605_963/master/1605.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71177fcd0675ae2d1a0513b5fb6480aa","title":"pep guardiola phil foden lyon champions leage","story":"Pep Guardiola believes Manchester City’s critics will claim his side has fallen short of greatness if they fail to win the Champions League.Should City defeat Lyon at the OL Stadium on Tuesday they will qualify for the knockout phase as Group F winners but while this would also be a third away victory in the group phase – the first time Guardiola would have achieved that feat – he is conscious that unless City claim the ultimate prize his team will not be considered one of the greats by naysayers.“For the people who don’t love us too much, who use money as an argument, then we have failed if we don’t win the Champions League,” he said. “For the other people, especially our fans, the people who say, ‘OK, we enjoy watching our games, we are happy with what the guys are doing’, I am pretty sure they don’t have regrets about what these guys are doing for the last 12, 14, 15 months every three days.“Then – OK, try it again, why not? And if we go to the quarter-finals and maybe you are lucky to go forward. After that, the competition it speaks for itself. A lot of desires, a lot of wishes we can have at the end. The competition is so tough, so clinical, to say if you are better you are going to win, if you don’t, you are going home.”Guardiola was referring to the muscle injuries to Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gündogan, which means they join Kevin De Bruyne as frontline midfielders who are unavailable. While Gabriel Jesus also has a foot problem, the absence of Silva and Gündogan means Guardiola will have to decide whether to give Phil Foden a second Champions League start of his fledgling career.Guardiola has no doubt the 18-year-old is ready for the challenge. “I had the feeling in pre-season – I was incredibly impressed then,” he said. “He’s stronger, more conscious that he’s able to play with us.“Every time he has played he’s played good, pre-season, 90 minutes, always good. When you ask I always say he’s part of the squad and he’s definitely ready.”Lyon inflicted City’s sole defeat in all competitions this season, winning September’s reverse fixture 2-1. “They were better than us,” Guardiola said. “We lost the first game against a tough team and we have the chance to qualify. We come to do our jobs.A draw will ensure progression and it would also take Lyon through if Hoffenheim against Shakhtar Donestk also finishes level. “I want to qualify, that’s the first target,” Guardiola said. “If you make one or two mistakes you can be out. This competition is so dangerous. We have not qualified and in this competition it’s not done until it’s done.“The first thing is to qualify and then to finish first in the group and we travel here to do that. You lose the first game at home and the group stage becomes so tough. We did our job winning the next three.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ccb9e20ecdab57671159f625bf51894eac0b97/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c6e7363c927b96a6b0f5d53b005880c","title":"tell us who do you share your home with","story":"As part of a new series in the ’s Weekend magazine we are looking for interesting pairs who live togetherOur notion of the traditional household is changing.

The former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre criticised Rusbridger in his lecture on Sunday night.“His record on investigations in the public interest was exceptional, a model for how to hold the powerful to account,” Viner said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85a6cb9b3d4c7fc6af1d17db67cc329cac245ddf/0_688_2856_1714/master/2856.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f48feb5fa266273a6a6613e58c8e4718","title":"bbc puts period drama and one off specials on christmas menu","story":"Agatha Christie’s The ABC Murders and Victor Hugo’s Les Miserables among highlightsThe BBC has unveiled its Christmas TV schedule, with a focus on period drama and special editions of popular entertainment shows.High-profile series scheduled for the festive period include an adaptation of Agatha Christie’s The ABC Murders starring John Malkovich and Rupert Grint a six-part take on Victor Hugo’s Les Miserables with Dominic West as Jean Valjean, David Oyelowo and Lily Collins and a new version of Watership Down featuring the voices of John Boyega, Olivia Colman, Sir Ben Kingsley, Gemma Arterton, Peter Capaldi and Mackenzie Crook.Comedian Lee Mack will take part in a live episode of his long-running sitcom Not Going Out, and an adaptation of David Walliams’ children’s book The Midnight Gang, starring the comedian, as well as food specials featuring former Great British Bake Off stars Nadiya Hussain and Mary Berry are also scheduled.There will also be special end-of-year editions of Mrs Brown’s Boys, Call the Midwife, Strictly Come Dancing and the traditional Christmas episode of Eastenders.Two episodes of Morecambe and Wise will be shown on BBC Two after the original colour tapes were lost for 50 years due to the corporation’s 1960s policy of wiping tapes after broadcast.The two black and white episodes were found by specialist preservation expert Philip Morris in a derelict cinema in Sierra Leone, where they had been sent for potential overseas sales. Both 30-minute episodes have been returned to colour. They featured in the first series when the comedy duo returned to the BBC after a stint with a commercial broadcaster, and one includes an appearance by Michael Aspel.Mark Gatiss will “bring the Christmas ghost story tradition back to life” with The Dead Room on BBC Four, while other specials include a programme celebrating 20 years since Goodness Gracious Me was first aired, a one-off comedy film starring Stephen Merchant, and People Just Do Nothing star Asim Chaudhry in a one-off comedy Christmas film.In a sign of the times, many of the BBC’s big-budget programmes have already been sold overseas to help the broadcaster bear the substantial costs associated with producing a high-profile drama series in 2018. Les Miserables is a co-production with US network Masterpiece and Watership Down is a co-production with Netflix, while Amazon Prime has snapped up the rights to show The ABC Murders in the US.Other Christmas schedules are also coming together, with ITV promising a Love Island Christmas special and a biopic of Olympic ice skaters Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, in addition to the traditional Coronation Street special.The BBC has already unveiled its Christmas radio schedule, which includes Angelina Jolie guest editing the Today programme, but its research and development lab has added a new interactive drama for Amazon Alexa devices called The Unfortunates.

What impact is this having on our lives, and what can be done to prevent it? We want to hear your thoughtsIs the internet really destroying our high streets?Increasingly, the convenience and cheapness of online retailers like Amazon is cannibalising independent firms and high street retailers. Many buyers skip the trip into town, or go there to assess the product and then buy it cheaper from the comfort of their sofa. As global capitalism continues its seemingly unstoppable growth, many wonder if we have reached “peak stuff”, thanks to years of high consumption. The switch to online shopping, combined with a slowdown in spending and rising costs from business rates and wages, has battered the profit margins of many retailers. There is also a major shift underway in how consumers spend their leisure time, too – more often choosing to spend their spare cash on holidays and experiences rather than in shopping malls, and increasingly opting to entertain, dine and drink at home. Meanwhile, businesses such as beauty salons, barbers and health clubs are on the ascent, since their services cannot be replicated online, and for many countries there has been a massive surge in vaping shops, coffee houses, and ice cream parlours.The growth in e-commerce is often cited as the main reason well-known retailers are struggling. But is taxing online firms the whole solution? After it was raised in the UK’s budget, the British high street momentarily looked set for rehabilitation. But 2018 has seen more closures across the country. Pubs, fashion outlets and estate agents are prominent among 24,205 closures recorded in the first six months of this year in the UK alone, and the number of shops, pubs and restaurants lying empty has soared by more than 4,400. And that’s just in Britain.Every year, the crisis faced by huge numbers of shops and businesses costs tens of thousands of jobs across Europe and the US. Major chains have collapsed into administration this year while many others have been forced to seek legal agreements with their landlords to shut stores and slash their rent bills. Beyond retail, many towns are having to fight to save their local library, pub, nursery or community centre – the places that have always fulfilled a social function as well as a commercial one.Yet, amid all this, it is easy to forget that, globally, the vast majority of sales – at least four-fifths – are still made in stores, as e-commerce giants have noted. The two worlds are still in the process of converging, so what might this mean for our communities, and is there hope yet of a resurgence?We want to examine the effects of these retail shift on the lives of people across the world, and how it is impacting economies, democracies, and families. How are local businesses coping or adapting? And workers with specialist skills? How is the ‘warehouse culture’ affecting rates of job satisfaction and the welfare of iniduals? And importantly, what action can we take to help slow or even reverse the onward march of e-commerce giants, or at least make them only a part of the picture. We at the  have covered how York’s Bishy road has cultivated the creation of what urban planners call ‘a sticky street’, where ‘time spent’ and enjoyment factor are the key aims of retailers, and we’ve explored how the ‘experience economy’ of a high street without actual shops could work. Our reporters have gone to areas like Bristol and Liverpool where local currencies have been trialled as a means of keeping profits in the neighbourhood. And we continue to examine whether taxing online retailers is the most effective thing that can be done to ease the situation.The debate is ongoing, and we want to hear from you, wherever you are in the world, for this month’s podcast. Please do get in touch: we would like to hear your questions, views, experiences.

I was gutted to stop working alongside my amazing job-share, Heather Stewart, but excited to find myself back at our headquarters in King’s Cross.The new team was placed on a bank of desks on the second floor, close to the Observer newsroom, where colleagues I’d worked with for eight years before leaving for the parliamentary lobby in 2009 are still beavering away. On our other side are (usefully!) the lawyers and the sports desk, followed by global development writers, and a strengthened environment team.Then – just two minutes around the corner – is the newsdesk, where the volume rises as editors gather around desks to make quick, collective decisions on rolling stories.Given our aim is to showcase  and Observer journalism by telling its stories in a fresh and engaging way, sitting in the middle of two newsrooms feels like the perfect location. Meanwhile, we can turn to the reporting teams in the US and Australia, foreign correspondents in Europe, Africa and Asia and some of the best opinion writers in the world.As for the podcast itself, our central aim is to provide listeners with 20 minutes every day that never scrimps on storytelling but is anchored in the news agenda.To achieve that, the  has built a team that feels unique: because it brings together radio documentary makers with news junkies like me. That mix of skills and ideas has lent itself to an incredibly creative team in which everyone is learning a huge amount.And I’ve been really pleased with the pieces that combination of strengths has resulted in already – focusing on interesting news ideas, but telling them in a narrative, audio-rich way that we hope to develop over time. The first few episodes have been well received and have already given us good ideas on what works well.The most exciting thing has been quickly realising the scale of the talent we have to draw on here at the . Having covered politics for many years, I already knew there were excellent reporters in domestic policy areas such as the ’s Patrick Butler, an expert on universal credit, and – of course – Heather and her team in Westminster, with whom we have covered the fast-moving story of Brexit. However, I had not worked with foreign correspondents such as Tom Phillips and Bethan McKernan, whose takes on the election of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and the war in Yemen combined excellent analysis with powerful and emotional stories from the ground.The format has also allowed us to be experimental, whether that means interviews with external figures such as the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, or spending a day racing around Westminster to give a behind-the-scenes feel on a huge day for news.My co-presenter, India Rakusen, has done powerful episodes: one on poverty in Britain and another on the legacy of the Iraq war, for which Peter Beaumont was able to record for the podcast on the ground.The fact that not many others are producing similar content in the UK means that Today in Focus is inevitably a work in progress in every respect, from the subjects we choose and people we interview to the workflow we follow to get the product completed each day.The overall hope is to bring  stories, told by its reporters alongside their writing, to a wider, younger and more erse audience. And our position, at the centre of a values-based organisation whose global voice has been amplified in the face of political shocks such as the elections of Donald Trump and Brexit, make that something I believe we can achieve.Being based in the  means we can be more credible than many of the websites cheerleading for their favoured politicians, but far more spiky than the BBC. Where the Today programme tries to give you headlines, we want to give you heart.We hope to offer a mix of immediate news stories, looked at from fresh angles, alongside deep es into major, rolling stories. Then there is an opinion section, where we will hear from  and Observer regulars as well as other voices from outside the building.For me, it’s a bit of a dream job, isn’t it? I get to sit in a studio day after day, discussing really interesting topics with the best journalists in the world, and working alongside some of the best young producers in the country to find new ways to present them. So far, in pilots and for real episodes, I’ve been discussing everything you can imagine, from Trump to Theresa May, the refugee crisis to Brexit, plastics to cocaine.And I’ve already experienced how differently you get to engage with your audience through a podcast. Along with Heather, I’ve been presenting Politics Weekly for the past two years, and I’ve always loved hearing from listeners who say they feel closer to my reporting when presented in that way.Today in Focus is going to be a bit experimental as we try things out with format, style and tone. In time, we will find the voice that we believe works best for us and as a platform for the . So please: come, try and (I hope) enjoy what we have to offer, but do also pile in with feedback and ideas.If you give us just 20 minutes of your time, we promise you will learn something relevant, interesting and new every day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6a9948f617db6a18f9ac885925f7d5ee72512df/0_156_3129_1877/master/3129.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aaac1ae05deabc7759ca6381910bb89f","title":"wyevale dobbies sale gift card","story":"I was shocked when I couldn’t use spend £150 voucher locally and was told to travel miles awayI am a keen gardener and was fortunate to receive more than £150-worth of Wyevale garden centres gift cards for my recent summer birthday.

However, when I visited last weekend I was shocked to see that it is now a Dobbies garden centre.I was finally told that I could not use the cards there but that I could do so at other centres. However, the three “relatively” near me are a considerable drive away. This all seems unfair as it is hardly my fault that the company has changed hands.This was unfortunate timing as the sale of this centre to Dobbies – one of five Wyevales sold off recently by its private equity owners – was only completed two and a half weeks ago. You were not told that customers can actually redeem their gift cards online as well as in any Wyevale garden centre following any sales of local centres (which are ongoing).The company says: “There are still more than 100-plus Wyevale garden centres in operation.

The first song I wrote was called Ice Cream and Wafers. The next was Holding Back the Years.I didn’t realise what it was about until I’d finished it. It’s about that moment where you know you have to leave home and make your mark, but the outside world is scary. So you’re holding back the years.The line “Strangled by the wishes of pater” is my dad screaming at me: “When are you going to get a decent job? Tidy up after yourself!” The line “Hoping for the arms of mater” rhymes with pater, but I didn’t know what it was like to have a mother. My mum left when I was three and my dad never remarried.I first sang Holding Back the Years in my earliest band, Frantic Elevators. When the Elevators split and I started Simply Red, I returned to the song and wrote the “I’ll keep holding on” chorus.The song is credited to me and Neil Moss, the guitarist in the Frantic Elevators and my oldest friend. Neil didn’t write it, but we wrote so many songs together that I gave him a credit to remember the great times we had. We shared a flat, we toured with the Fall. We were skint, but it was magical.After Holding Back the Years became a hit, my mum tracked me down, but I thought: “My dad was there every day. Cooked my meals, wiped my arse and where were you? You think you can walk back into my life and it be OK?” My seeing her was making my dad unhappy. I realised that there was no future in it.People strive for success, but it’s very lonely at the top. Now I realise the ultimate prize is a family. I’m married with a kid, and the last 10 years have been the happiest of my life. My father was never that supportive of my pop career, but I understand now that he was trying to protect me. A working-class bloke who worked in a barber’s for 35 years couldn’t have imagined his son would sell millions of records. Even after the second album, when I was already very wealthy, he was a bit drunk after a show once and said to me: “You realise you’re still gonna have to get a decent job after all this, don’t you?” Oh, Dad.I was one of three budding brass players living in a flat in Hulme, Manchester. We wrote to Factory Records’ boss, Tony Wilson, asking him to give us a job. One day, there was a knock at the door and Tony said: “Right, come to the Haçienda and play for us, then.” We played some Charlie Parker riffs and this skinny little bloke said he liked it. He turned out to be Vini Reilly from the Durutti Column, who asked us to play on his studio album, Without Mercy. Anyone except Vin and Tony would have told us to fuck off.After Mick heard us, we all ended up in the early Simply Red, making the Picture Book album in Holland with the legendary American sax player Stuart Levine producing. I was this skinny, awestruck white kid just out of music college and I think he thought: “These cats ain’t gonna cut it.” We all got the heave ho, but then, when the band was back in the UK recording in the RAK studios in London (which looked like the cockpit of a 747), Mick asked me to rejoin.Someone suggested a trumpet solo on Holding Back the Years. I’d been listening to Miles Davis’s Kind of Blue, and he used a harmon mute – a bulky metal thing you stick in the end of the trumpet. I decided to put one in. Poor Levine must’ve thought: “What’s he doing now?” But I played something spontaneous and everyone liked it. A trumpet was pretty rare in pop and Levine was going: “I can’t fucking believe it, man. We’ve got a trumpet solo.” When I do the solo in the video, it’s out of sync: my fingers aren’t playing what is coming out. I don’t know if Mick’s even noticed, but it has always bugged me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/887a1179bc34190b98ff9dbe07b4408d2915a613/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=465\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9a17601bbcbdfd4fac0d4a2dbc510d0e 930w","title":"best photos of day mass disco muddy race new aiarbus","story":"’s picture editors bring you highlights from around the world, including a record-breaking disco in London and a gruelling race in Lebanon"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b918bcda48b3e7e5e5903173ef6cfc3de95b5703/90_36_2735_1641/master/2735.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da398ffc02ce0450fb75454db0ab23e9","title":"ministers consider backing norway plus as brexit plan b","story":"Soft Brexit option could be fallback if Commons rejects Theresa May’s dealAlmost half of Theresa May’s cabinet have held talks to weigh up the possibility of backing a soft Brexit option as a plan B if parliament rejects the prime minister’s EU withdrawal deal.Four cabinet ministers have held meetings to discuss the “Norway plus” plan amid concerns at the top of government that May will struggle to muster enough votes to get her proposals through the Commons.Five other, remain-backing ministers – David Lidington, Philip Hammond, Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark – are understood to have agreed to try to get the prime minister to support a softer departure from the EU.Their favoured option is believed to be staying in a permanent customs union, which is currently Labour policy, increasing the likelihood of the plan making it through the Commons. “We see that as the best way of guaranteeing frictionless trade if the deal falls,” one said.The group have been meeting weekly for some time, either at the Treasury or in their Commons offices, to discuss the government’s options if the deal is defeated. “They just don’t make as much of a fuss about it as their Brexit-supporting colleagues,” one source said.Nick Boles, a former minister and a leading advocate of a Norway-style departure from the EU, confirmed that he had spoken to four cabinet ministers, thought to include Michael Gove, a leading Brexiter, about his proposals.Supporters of the Norway plus campaign, which is pushing for the UK to join the European Free Trade Association (Efta) and have a customs arrangement with the EU, believe Tory MPs and ministers should start to apply pressure on May to swing behind it.The campaign for Norway plus has gathered momentum since the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, and the DUP’s Arlene Foster – who have both said their parties would not support May’s deal – indicated in recent days they would consider the option.“Everyone is looking for a plan B. There is gathering momentum for Norway plus. We are seeing the makings of a parliamentary majority,” Boles told the .“We have to take on the chin that the EU have said they won’t negotiate the withdrawal agreement. But they might be prepared to renegotiate the political declaration.”Boles has also held talks with Labour MPs, 75 of whom defied party instructions to abstain from voting for European Economic Area (EEA) membership in June.He hopes the majority could be persuaded to back his plan, although a number have now come out for a second referendum.He said: “Labour MPs want to be able to fulfil their obligations to their leadership and party members before being asked to support Norway plus. That’s why it needs to be a fallback plan that comes into play after all the votes have happened and all other avenues have been closed off.”However, even supporters of the Norway plus plan acknowledge it would present difficulties for the prime minister, whose key Brexit red line is to end freedom of movement. Efta members are obliged to admit workers from elsewhere in the EEA.Supporters argue, however, that the “emergency brake” that exists for members would allow the UK to cap migration in extreme circumstances, while the government has begun registering all EEA nationals already in the UK, meaning that if they fail to find work within a few months, it will be able to remove them.May’s official spokesman said: “The prime minister believes the deal that she has delivered is the right one for the country and one of the main reasons for that is that it allows us to take back control on our borders by ending freedom of movement.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fdd00fc1692a6b3ebcf8dec2881123199b7c346/0_338_6048_3629/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87676fb8c2b363b5795aaa04d0039fbb","title":"startups defy gravity explore space commercial frontiers microgravity experimentation","story":"Small firms spot an opportunity in emerging industry of microgravity experimentationIn a cramped office hidden within the poorly lit corridors of a shopping mall in Israel, sits the equivalent of Nasa’s mission control in Houston.Yet there are no rows of scientists and flight controllers wearing headsets, all of their faces fixed on a large screen charting spacecraft. And no astronauts telling them they have a problem.Instead, three large computer screens display a world map showing a satellite, roughly the size of a large shoebox, orbiting the globe. It is one of many private autonomous “space labs” conducting experiments for paying clients including pharmaceutical firms, universities and chemical companies.This is the new frontier of space exploration and research. Enormous, slow-moving government agencies such as Nasa no longer have a monopoly. The sector has commercialised, making room for large aerospace companies including SpaceX and Boeing, but also plucky startups exploiting increasingly cheaper access to the heavens.The one in Israel, SpacePharma, is attempting to tap into one emerging space industry: microgravity experimentation.At the core of what it provides is the ability to run tests in a situation that is currently impossible to replicate on the planet – a zero gravity, or very close to zero gravity, environment. And without gravity, an unavoidable constant that has forever restricted every experiment, a new field of science is promising breakthroughs.“In space, everything is different,” said Yair Glick, the research and development director at SpacePharma. Almost nothing – chemicals, plants and even human cells – behave the same in microgravity as they do on Earth.Even the most simple experiment produces new results: “If we mix water with oil, we know the water goes down and the oil. Not so in space,” said Glick.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theNational space agencies have been conducting microgravity research for decades, often on the effects of muscles and bones of astronauts, but also on how it affects other elements, for example, flames – they don’t flicker upwards but instead form a ball.The results have been astonishing. One experiment conducted by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency looked at the proteins associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which primarily affects young boys and leaves them immobile.Proteins, the building blocks of cells, crystallise differently in space as they are unburdened by the Earth’s pull and form in a more orderly way. Researchers were able to record their new structure and make medicine that drastically delays the effects of the disease. Its creators claim it could potentially double the life of patients and keep them walking until 25, instead of 12.Rich Godwin runs the US firm Space Technology Holding, which takes research done in space and applies it to the real-world market. Commercial microgravity testing is a potentially huge market, he believes, and expects more big successes as it privatises. “It’s not changing chemistry. It’s changing physics,” he said. “It’s like the invention of the microscope.”Yossi Yamin, the chief executive and founder of SpacePharma, estimates there are about 30 private companies selling microgravity experiments.There are three main ways to do it. The first can be done on Earth by renting a plane and noseing in parabolic flight, simulating weightlessness. But the process is extremely imprecise and only lasts a few seconds.Most companies instead rent space 250 miles up on the International Space Station, which acts as a sort of real estate agent for low Earth orbit. They make small automatic laboratories that are sent up on a rocket, often when astronauts are delivered, and are plugged into the wall. In these, liquids can be heated, cooled, and tiny automatic pumps allow customers to mix chemicals.SpacePharma also provides free-roaming satellites, which orbit the Earth independently. Its first was sent up on an Indian rocket in 2017.In the small office in Herzliya, a city that is the tech hub of Israel, the nanosatellites are handmade, in a lab with a plastic 3D printer and a soldering table. “If you have autonomous mobile units, you can command and control it from your mobile,” said Yamin, who worked for the Israeli army’s satellite fleet for 25 years.Each satellite costs about £2.4m but has enough space for 12 clients, whose experiments can run concurrently, dramatically lowering the cost. The commercial space research business is worth about half a billion, he estimates. But he is betting on a market boom.Pharmaceutical companies are looking at creating drugs in space that are more effective than those made on Earth. Once these more-perfect proteins are formed, they can be used as “seeds” to duplicate back on Earth. “These are masterpieces created in orbit,” Yamin said.The next stage in the field of microgravity, industry insiders believe, will be “space factories” where materials that can only be made in space are manufactured.Twyman Clements, the chief executive of Space Tango, a US firm that began launches last year and has conducted 88 experiments in space, including one commissioned by Budweiser on barley and another that looked at how cannabis reacts in space. But now it is moving into making products in space and bringing them back.“This is not just about research. It has scalable application,” said Clements, who grew up on a farm in Kentucky and made his own rockets. “We look at high-value products made in microgravity for Earth,” he said. They need to have a high price tag because it costs so much to send material up and down.There are already customers looking to make fibre optic cables, which are more efficient when manufactured in space. And another product that could be produced in orbit are retinal implants to restore vision, which are made from light-activated proteins but do not form well on Earth under their own weight. Space Tango is looking at how it could make them in space.“The next steps are toward production,” said Clements. “That has not happened quite yet. The retinal impacts could be the first.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

The result shocked onlookers in light of the champion’s advantages in position and time, and left the best-of-12-games match in a historic 6-6 deadlock.The latest bloodless result, the 12th draw between the world’s top two players in as many contests, ensured the €1m ($1.14m) showdown in London will go down as the first title match in which no decisive results were managed in the official 132-year history of world championship play.Carlsen, 27, has been ranked No 1 for eight straight years and was considered the world’s best player even before he defeated Viswanathan Anand for the title in 2013. Caruana, 26, is ranked No 2, having earned his place at the table by winning the candidates tournament in March. No American-born player has won or even competed for the world title since Bobby Fischer in 1972.\u0026nbspIt marks the first title match between the world\u0027s top two players since 1990, when Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov faced off for a fifth and final time.\u0026nbspThe match will consist of 12 classical games with each player awarded one point for a win and a half-point for a draw. Whoever reaches six and a half points first will be declared the champion.The time control for each game is 100 minutes for the first 40 moves, 50 minutes for the next 20 moves and then 15 minutes for the rest of the game plus an additional 30 seconds per move starting from move 1. Players cannot agree to a draw before Black\u0027s 30th move.\u0026nbspIf the match is tied after 12 games, tie-breaks will be played on the final day in the following order:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp• Best of four rapid games with 25 minutes for each player with an increment of 10 seconds after each move.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp• If still tied, they will play up to five mini-matches of two blitz games (five minutes for each player with a three-second increment).\u0026nbsp• If all five mini-matches are drawn, one sudden-death \u0027Armegeddon\u0027 match will be played where White receives five minutes and Black receives four minutes. Both players will receive a three-second increment after the 60th move.

The tiebreak will consist of a best-of-four rapid match with 25 minutes for each player with an increment of 10 seconds after each move. If that is not enough to break the deadlock, they will play up to five mini-matches of two blitz games (five minutes for each player with a three-second increment). If all five mini-matches are drawn, it will come down to one sudden-death ‘Armageddon’ match in which white receives five minutes, black receives four minutes and both will receive a three-second increment after the 60th move. If that game is drawn, black will be declared the winner.Carlsen, who in addition to his No 1 ranking is the world’s top-rated rapid player and top-rated blitz player (compared to Caruana’s respective ratings of No 8 and No 16), is widely regarded as a strong favorite in the format, not least due to a 13-year unbeaten record in tie-breakers. But Garry Kasparov said on Monday that Carlsen’s hasty draw offer betrayed a lapse of nerve in the reigning champion.“In light of this shocking draw offer from Magnus in a superior position with more time, I reconsider my evaluation of him being the favorite in rapids,” the longtime world No 1 wrote on Twitter. “Tiebreaks require tremendous nerves and he seems to be losing his.”Caruana, as white, played into the Sveshnikov variation in Monday’s classical finale, as he did in the eighth and 10th games. Carlsen was first to deviate from those lines with 8. ... Ne7 and Caruana quickly fell behind on time after the champion played a novelty with 12. ... h5.The 26-year-old American challenger was offered a chance for a draw by repetition shortly after (13. Qa4 Bd7 14. Qb4 Bf5) but bravely opted to play on with 15. Be3. Yet Caruana’s temporal problems compounded over the next few moves (15. ... a6 16. Nc3 Qc7 17. g3 Be7 18. f3 Nf8 19. Ne4 Nd7 20. Bd3) and he soon found himself nearly 50 minutes behind on the clock.After Carlsen castled following a 12-minute think (20. ... O-O), Caruana delivered a surprise move (21. Rh2!?) that cost him in the opinion of the evaluation engines, but earned praise from the Russian grandmaster Alexander Grischuk from the commentary booth: “The deepest move in the match so far,” he said.Even after the champion expended another 10 minutes before playing 21. ... Rac8, Carlsen was ahead in development with more than a half-hour advantage in time. He pressed the initiative with 22. ... Bg6 23. Rc2 f5 and Caruana’s dubious 25. f4 sent the computers haywire. The challenger’s position appeared increasingly difficult to hold after 26. ... e4 27. Be2 Be8 28. Kb1 Bf6 29. Re1 a4 30. Qb4 g6.Which made Carlsen’s decision to offer a draw after 31. Rd1 Ra8 nothing short of mystifying. A relieved Caruana gladly accepted after a game that had lasted two hours and 57 minutes, sending the match to Wednesday’s tie-breaker.He added: “I’m mainly relieved because I thought it was quite close today. I was very worried during the game. When you feel like you’re sort of on the brink of defeat, or at least you have a very dangerous position, then of course it’s quite good.”Both players bristled at the notion that a world title match consisting solely of draws could undercut the sport’s popularity, addressing the central talking point of their three-week psychodrama.“We work with the match that we have,” Caruana said. “If the powers that be want to change it, then we’ll work with something else.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46b7de7674ca31c4b9d67647ce7feae9d98dc2dc/0_0_2419_1451/master/2419.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c086fe65b75ef1b1dde0766d3e1feb35","title":"team of the 2018 autumn internationals rugby union","story":"Five Ireland players make the cut after their exceptional November while players from Fiji and Japan have also caught the eyeWill always keep opponents interested but no one on the planet has better footwork.

If this limits their staging, they have made a virtue of it. The production runs for 100 minutes straight through, so they must be well out of the way by the time David Threlfall needs to get into his dressing room.And there is little need for a set when the play begins with witches as majestic as these three: Aidan Cheng in white tulle skirt and black patent fetish shoes, Jeffrey Sangalang in white face paint and white cropped trousers with a white backpack bandaged to his body, and Simran Hunjun in a shoulder-padded red column that reaches to the floor. All three have dark, swollen, berry-coloured lips.Their twisted sexuality is only more disconcerting when they double as the murderers of Banquo and Macduff’s wife and child. Sangalang – now dressed entirely in red – breaks the neck of his quarry with a terrifying ruthlessness. Moments later he appears in Macbeth’s castle to bring the news, carrying a red balloon that reads: “Congratulations.”Moira Buffini’s ruthless edit gives the play an urgency and focus that it all too often lacks, concentrating on the relationship between Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, played by Olivia Dowd and Isabel Adomakoh Young in this gender-fluid version. Dowd is utterly convincing as a woman who will commit murder to slake her own and her wife’s ambition. Their intimacy, brutality and fear are shared: Young expresses real horror when she claims that she would have murdered Duncan (Marilyn Nnadebe) “had she not resembled my mother as she slept”.The depiction of guilt is one of the production’s less successful elements. Although the blacked-out mouths of the ghosts are the stuff of nightmares, they provoke nervous laughter from the audience rather than fear. But, under Natasha Nixon’s slick direction, the pace rarely drops, rushing us to Macbeth’s final battle against the raging Macduff (an excellent Oseloka Obi), as her confidence gradually yields to fear and terrible certainty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/411747fc874e04aaf7a06d8b0966f9a6678c2cb1/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98bead8cea036f38fd0251abda273640","title":"first impressions exes and smooth exits master the art of conversation","story":"There’s no avoiding it, the season filled with cheer is also filled with chat – conversations you don’t want to have and ones you want to shine in. From how to tell a joke to how to handle an ex, experts advise A funny thing happens at the beginning of December. Suddenly, as the year comes to a close, you find yourself unable to say no to mulled wine, even if a hot, sickly-sweet punch is antithetical to your idea of good drinking colleagues regarded as the most dogged homebodies now seem to be joining you at the pub then the whole thing is brought to a close by spending the day with a group of people, most often related to you, many of whom you haven’t seen for a year, and will most likely not see again for another year.What all of this means is that if there’s one thing you’d better be ready for come Christmastime, it’s to socialise – to chat your way through dinner parties, drinks receptions, office get-togethers and pubs. Which is why we’ve solicited the advice of relationship columnist Justin Myers, AKA the Guyliner, linguist and communication expert Malgorzata Chalupnik, and drinks writer Nina Caplan to cover a few of the conundrums you’re likely to come up against this silly season, starting with …How to make a good first impression“One of the biggest letdowns when meeting someone for the first time is their evident lack of interest,” says Myers. “When someone asks you something, what they really want to do is tell you what they think. All it takes is ‘and you?’ once you’ve given your answer, and you’re already way ahead of most people,” he says.Chalupnik adds the key isn’t just paying attention, but outwardly conveying the fact that you are paying attention – what she describes as “active listenership”.“We constantly reveal more about ourselves to others through how we say things, our body language, our facial expressions and gestures. Making a good impression is not just about what we say, it can also revolve around the idea of how we show that we pay attention to other people,” she says.“Active listenership itself is all about showing that we listen to other people. The way to best signal it is through eye contact, orientating our body towards the speaker and nodding to show that we’re engaged.”And how do we know if it’s worked?“The theory of communication accommodation argues that if we like someone, we’re more likely to speak or act like them,” Chalupnik says. “If you notice that the person you are talking to starts sounding a bit more like you, for example, you are on the right track.”How to make small talkYou may not like it, but the need to make small talk is one of life’s unavoidable realities – and for good reason, according to Chalupnik. “Small talk establishes and maintains harmonious social relations,” she says.But this fact doesn’t make it any less challenging. “Small talk is terrifying only because we’re scared of boring each other to death,” says Myers. “How small should the talk stay? Weather? No, please, no. Vague humble bragging about your job or loft conversion? It’s a tough one.” His advice is that winning at the small talk game is all about keeping things “light, topical and totally devoid of political posturing – it can never end well”.“Box sets, fitness regimes, favourite restaurants and books are a popular way of revealing aspects of your personality without outing yourself as too much of a nightmare,” he says. “Sport, too, if you can bear the armchair punditry.”If you still find the idea of small talk stomach-churning, it’s worth remembering that you don’t have to do all the work – listening and accommodating others is just as important, says Chalupnik. “As with making a good first impression, the key is to provide all speakers the chance to engage,” she says.How to tell an anecdote or joke We’ve all been there: that moment when your great punchline is met with stony silence. It’s not a pleasant feeling, and it’s something that, once burned, we wouldn’t look to repeat. The good news is that there are strategies to avoid this, says Myers.“Read the room first. There’s nothing worse than launching into your best gag only to see horror creep across the faces of your audience,” he says. “It’s best to wait for a gap in conversation, too. Nobody likes being yanked out of a deep conversation only to be told a joke of Christmas cracker calibre.”Chalupnik concurs: “Know your audience. Know your context,” she says. “Humour, despite being a very useful and multi-faceted device, can also backfire.” She advises sticking to self-denigrating, anecdotal humour and avoiding sarcasm, which can be easily misread.“Sarcasm can carry a potentially aggressive meaning, so its interpretation can vary depending on the person we speak to,” she says. “Before using sarcasm, make sure that you are certain that they don’t mind it.”In much the same way, Myers believes that telling an anecdote well requires a good dose of self-awareness and respect for the time of the person to whom you are talking. “Have faith in the anecdote,” he says. “Tell it confidently and as quickly as possible without losing your listeners or missing parts out. And never, ever preface an anecdote or joke with: ‘Listen to this, it’s brilliant’ – the only way from there is down.”How to talk about alcohol like a proFrom knowing how to comment on a wine you’ve been sharing, to knowing when to avoid telling a debauched drinking tale, there is absolutely a right and a wrong way to talk about alcohol, according to food journalist Caplan.“Gauge your audience,” she says. “There’s no point telling stories about drunkenness to a clutch of wine professionals, and there’s equally little to gain in wittering on about grape varieties and soil types to twentysomethings in the pub.”Myers offers a similar view on those stories detailing some prodigious feat of alcoholic intake, which is that they are to be avoided entirely. “Never, ever mention how many drinks it takes to make you fall over,” he says. “Drunk stories are not badges of honour any more.”But it is possible to talk about alcohol with both dignity and tact, says Caplan, particularly when it comes to wine and grape-distilled spirits. “There are a few basic flavour profiles you can learn,” she says. “So, new world rieslings are quite often tropical in flavour, syrahs are spicy and peppery. Cognacs tend to have nutty andor fruity notes.”If you’re after a quick way to sound like you know what you’re talking about, Caplan suggests you start by dropping these keywords: bouquet (“this basically translates to: ‘what the wine smells like’ – but a much prettier word”), blend (“if there is more than one kind of grape in the wine, it’s a blend”) and tannin (“if the wine has a chewy, slightly drying sensation in the mouth, tannins – compounds found in the grape – are responsible”).“Just remember that they are your tastebuds,” says Caplan. “So, even if what you smell or taste is entirely different from what the books or your companions tell you, nobody can tell you that you’re wrong.”Alternatively, stay away from precise descriptions altogether, and wow ‘em with some fun boozy titbits instead: “For instance,” Caplan says, “the oldest and finest cognacs are aged in a special cellar, accessible only to the cellar master. This cellar within a cellar is so-named because the portion of the liquid in the barrel that evaporates as it ages is known as the angels’ share.” Baptiste Loiseau, the cellar master for Rémy Martin, says that their angels’ share equates to as much as 8,000 bottles a day (he also says you should serve their Rémy Martin 1738 with frozen grapes instead of ice cubes, so it doesn’t get diluted – serve that as you drop the angels’ share bomb for serious pro points).Pick up a bottle hereHow to speak to someone you kissed under the mistletoe last ChristmasIn a month defined by a) large gatherings and b) large measures, its not unthinkable that you might bump into a ghost of Christmas’ past – whether a one-time, under the mistletoe thing or a full-on ex – so you need to learn how to handle it like an adult.“‘I didn’t recognise you with your clothes on’ is an opener best avoided,” says Myers. “Chatting to people we’ve kissed is only awkward because we insist on acting like teenagers around one another,” says Myers.“If you haven’t been in touch since,” he says, “you may have to wheel out an apology. ‘I’ve been so busy, I’m rubbish at keeping in touch’, is the excuse they expect, so don’t let them down.”Otherwise, he advises “not to mention the kiss”, but do your best to “be charming and, most of all to not expect a repeat performance”.And when it comes to an unexpected encounter with an ex? “As is the case with any conversation, being civil is a good idea,” says Chalupnik. “If there is any conflict there, your aim should be to gradually moderate your position and de-escalate the verbal conflict.” In other words, play nice.And finally, how to make a polite exitWhether you’re just pulling out of a conversation, or leaving a party outright, knowing how to make a polite exit is an underrated and poorly understood social skill, says Myers.“Once a conversation has run its course, it can still be tricky to bring it to an official end,” he says. “Even awkward silences and the dreaded ‘well …’ leave some undaunted. The best way to get out of a conversation is to start another one.”“It’s like a relay,” he says. “Either offer to go get them a drink and then bring someone else back with you to freshen things up, or say you’d like to introduce them to someone, and take them to join this new group. Then, once they’re chatting, make your departure. And if they do come to find you, have a spare drink at hand just in case, give it to them, exclaim ‘There you are!’ and await your Oscar nomination for best reaction.”Of course, making an exit – especially at this time of year – can be as much about knowing your limits as anything else. “Learning when to say ‘stop’ is part of becoming an adult,” says Caplan. “You have to ask yourself: ‘is this actually fun?’ And if the answer is ‘no’, you’ve probably surpassed your limits.”For more smart conversation starters, La Maison Rémy Martin members’ club offers cultural events, masterclasses and experiences from the leading names in food and drink, art and design, fashion, film and more from their residency at London’s Bibendum.

From Christmas cocktail parties to sit-down dinners, here’s how to host with impact and ease this seasonThe nights have drawn in, George and Mariah are in a state of perpetual soundclash, and with them comes the unsettling urge to host a seasonal get-together.If you’re an unsteady host, even an intimate dinner with a handful of friends can seem daunting, so when you chuck in the plus-ones, her next door and a cluster of colleagues, that “fun and festive” party can start to feel anything but.But things don’t need to get all out of control and Abigail’s Party. We live in a time when fine dining and Michelin-starred chefs appear in the most casual of settings, and that informality extends to the at-home-host, too. Claude Bosi - head chef of Bibendum restaurant and Rémy Martin cognac bar – is one such Michelin-starred chef who advocates this relaxed approach when entertaining.“The key to a great party,” he says, “is to ensure you are with your guests. There are so many dinner parties where you try to impress and find yourself spending more time in the kitchen than you spend with your guests. A great party is a balance between good food and good hospitality.”Here’s how it’s done:The dinner partyThis casual mantra starts at the top – the formalities of the past have been dispensed with. Invites can go out on WhatsApp or email. Similarly, boy-girl seating plans at dinner are a relic of another time. Remember, too, if there are only two single guests at a dinner party, they don’t necessarily want to be seated together, lest they feel like show ponies being watched over by the other guests for signs of good chemistry. And unless you have a particular gift for crafting, there’s no need for place names.That said, some small details done nicely can make a real difference. Take your dinner table, for example, as chef and caterer Stephanie Boote says: “I like a simple table, not too much fuss. A linen cloth can be lovely, napkins, if you have them. A couple of little vases or bottles with flowers or foliage. Candlelight is a must. You can have a pile of plates and cutlery on top of an undressed table, a water jug and a stack of glasses, and if you have candles lit it will all be just fine!”There are lots of ways to make life easier as you prep your dinner-party meal, especially as your guests arrive and the heat rises in the kitchen. For Bosi, a neat trick is to go for a cold starter. He suggests getting a terrine from a local deli and serving it with a salad, all handily ready to go on plates ahead of time.Food writer and author Killian Fox offers similar logic when feeding a crowd. “Simplify,” he says. “Instead of a starter, lay out a range of snacks – decent crisps and dips, olives, maybe some crostini – for people to eat when they come through the door. Use the time you’ve saved to make sure everyone has enough booze.”Drinks are, of course, key to a great dinner party. Leave time at the beginning for an aperitif, which will give you more breathing room to prepare your food, take account of inevitable late arrivals (“our Uber kept cancelling”) and let appetites build.Fox suggests a handy seasonal cocktail, too, named London Calling. “It was apparently devised at Milk \u0026amp Honey in Soho. It’s citrussy, it contains sherry, and it gives you a chance to look classy with a cocktail shaker. A fine Christmas drink.”Bosi suggests a drink can offer some surprises and lead to unexpected food pairings. He likes a Royal Sidecar, made with Rémy Martin 1738 Accord Royal cognac, Cointreau and lemon – and paired with oysters.“Until recently, cognac was something you would have after a great lunch,” he says. “It’s not something you’re expecting to drink at the start of the meal, but I find it goes very well with seafood. It’s a nice surprise, a bit of creativity. At that moment, you’ve made people really relaxed and given your meal a stamp of quality.”From then on, you can go with some classic dishes: a big joint of meat, a casserole that can be easily cooked in advance, a beautiful stew with game, or Bosi’s festive favourite: beef wellington.When it comes to serving, Bosi tends to stick to sharing plates. “I put pots in the middle of the table and we start sharing,” he says. “I think dinner parties with people closer to each other are a better atmosphere.”Boote adds a word of practical advice: “Preparation is key. Your guests are here to see you, not have you run about trying to do things. Keep it simple, with excellent ingredients that speak for themselves.”Dinner party music has long been something of a slur, a byword for a pleasant but bland background soundtrack. But you don’t want to be sitting in silence accompanied only by the sound of mastication and scraping forks, so head to Spotify to put together some playlists.For dinner, you want something that is eclectic but not too distracting – you don’t want to be continually flicking to the next song. However, you also don’t want to drift into nondescript tastefulness, either.The drinks partyInteresting people, nice snacks, some decent tunes and plenty of booze is all that’s needed for a drinks party. Keep things loose – this means submitting to the inevitable and assuming a crowd will congregate in your kitchen. Be ready to push some seats away in the living room if a late dance party emerges.When it comes to the drinks, try to be creative, says Boote: “This year, we have made a fig leaf syrup to go with lime juice, gin and soda. It’s delicious without the gin, too.” She follows that adding clementine flavours and fizz to spirits makes any drink feel “festive and delicious”.Of course, guests will be looking for something to nibble on, so lay out some decent crisps, popcorn or olives.You can also add some more expansive finger food into the mix. Boote goes for gougères, a French choux pastry filled with cheese, while Bosi will be serving up some intriguing offerings: Rémy Martin cognac, mixed with tonic (a Rémy Grand Tonic – the French spin on the British classic), served with his “pickled cockle popcorn”. The cockles are rolled in flour then deep-fried in hot oil, coming out as if popcorn. “It’s a fantastic pairing,” he says. To give it a seasonal twist, add some clove or orange to the cognac.Fox offers a snack serving with a backstory: “The Gilda – a pintxo created in honour of Rita Hayworth, who starred in the film Gilda. It’s pretty easy: skewer a couple of green olives on a toothpick with guindilla peppers and an anchovy fillet.”You want to keep the music equally eclectic but a little more upbeat. However, don’t feel the need to overload it with bangers and floor fillers. If the party goes late, you can bring out the hits. Remember to let a few people try out their music selections – it’s never fun to be overprotective of the music at a party, nor do you want one person hogging the speaker. Finally, if things take a particularly boozy turn, fire up some karaoke through YouTube.And finally …Really, there’s no set formula. Follow your instincts, embrace comfort and concentrate on having fun. And, if in doubt, remember some salient words from Bosi:“Just don’t try too hard. Don’t try to impress is the wrong thing to say – you want to impress – but stay in your comfort zone. Stay comfortable, enjoy yourself, keep it simple – and have a good time.”Make like Bosi and kick off that good time with a Royal Sidecar or Rémy Grand Tonic of your own – buy a bottle here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d16f1baa42848086581eec715d14587ea317697/0_0_2853_1712/master/2853.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47969a859d56d75d5d9857be65d4bda3","title":"the 12 saves of christmas an expert survival guide","story":"From emergency gift ideas to master mixology – via Jackson Boxer’s ballotine and Patrick Grant’s suit – experts share their must-haves and must-dos for surviving the festive season 1.

If in doubt, I now reach for Home Alone – guaranteed laughs for all ages – or White Christmas, which has that reassuring retro glow.”Smith has hosted private film events as part of the La Maison Rémy Martin members’ club2. Tim Halilaj, award-winning mixologist“People always run out of ice at Christmas parties, so the night before just fill your freezer with plastic containers of water and then hack these bergs into rugged lumps – they’re more on-trend than cubes. For totally clear ice, boil tap water, let it cool and then freeze it.”3. Shona Vertue, personal trainer (and David Beckham’s yoga teacher)“The gym seems like a distant memory over Christmas, but it doesn’t have to be that way. Type ‘HIIT’ into YouTube and do a 30-minute home workout, using nothing but your body weight to induce sweat and burn Christmas dinner calories. If nothing else, it gives you a break from the family for half an hour!”4. Garrett Moore, party planner and co-founder of Immersive Cult“Go for candlelight, scattered lamps and dim light. Some people feel self-conscious at parties and they don’t want to feel like they’re being watched, so low lighting is very conducive to good times. And create welcoming spaces where people can sit somewhere quiet and have a nice conversation if they want to. Maybe have a mistletoe area or create a little grotto-type nook. It’s nice for guests to feel like they have options and places to explore.”“I also have a bottle of Rémy Martin. I serve it with pickled cockle popcorn – it’s a fantastic pairing – with clove or orange added to the cognac to give it a seasonal twist.”Try Bosi’s cognac and pickled cockle pairing (and other seasonal cognac cocktails and food pairings) at Rémy Martin residency at Claude Bosi at Bibendum6. Polly Hadden-Paton, professional organiser to Suki Waterhouse and Lily Allen“I like to keep a few nice bottles, scented candles or tins of biscuits wrapped up in a drawer as fallback presents in case someone unexpectedly buys you something. And if they’re not claimed, that’s even better, as you can just enjoy them yourself.”7. Wrapologist Kirsten Westlake, from gift-wrapping service Wrapsody“Double-sided Sellotape is my secret weapon. It’s invisible and makes the finished product appear super slick. Most people come unstuck by using too much paper, which causes bulky, messy folds. The secret is to measure before you cut and use just enough paper to meet by about a centimetre.”8. Candice Brathwaite, parenting blogger“One tried-and-tested Christmas save if you’ve got a house full of children is advent stockings. I put them up on 1 December – containing 24 tiny, totally inexpensive gifts. The most important thing is that they aren’t allowed to open their advent presents until the end of the day, so it’s the perfect bribe to try and keep them in order until the evening.”9. Patrick Grant, fashion designer“If you’re having a suit tailored, have them cut you an evening suit with both a dress vest and a cummerbund. By this simple expedient, you can wear the same suit throughout the Christmas party season. Just switch between the two, change up your pocket hanky and, hey presto, with one suit you will look subtly different but always impeccable.”Grant has hosted private fashion events as part of the La Maison Rémy Martin members’ club10. Florist Anna Potter, from Swallows and Damsons“Bowls of one kind of fruit such as apples, figs, pomegranates or pears on a table make great centrepieces. Any fruit or vegetable that has an interesting shape, colour or texture looks amazing and harks back to Christmas being about feasting. And a sprig of rosemary looks beautiful on a place setting and also smells great. Or sneak some foliage from the garden and wrap it into a leafy circle to make a mini wreath for each guest.”11. Jackson Boxer, chef and restaurateur, St Leonards and Brunswick House“I make up a large ballotine of cured foie gras loaded with black truffles and brandy. It’s good to have on hand to quell appetites if anything goes wrong and causes any delays, or anyone shows up unexpectedly. And it’s outrageously delicious smeared on top of butter-fried cold Christmas pudding – a sentiment heartily endorsed by both chefs Fergus Henderson and Jeremy Lee, who know about such things.”12. Sam Lyle, co-founder of Pines and Needles“So many people order trees that are way too big for their room and have to hack bits off. The width of the tree is typically a third of the height, so be realistic about how much space you want it to take up. Trees are like flowers, they need water to stay fresh, so give your tree up to a litre of water every couple of days for the first few days, and then a litre once a week after that.”Whether you need to impress last-minute guests with some fun, festive cocktails or take Hadden-Paton’s advice and stock up on a few bottles of something smart to keep as emergency gifts, Rémy Martin could just be your ultimate seasonal save – the key ingredient to Bosi’s cocktail menu, the perfect accompaniment to pickled cockle popcorn (of course) and a rather elegant gift"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be4663fdf572eab95b3744ef217213ed35be18b2/0_131_4041_2424/master/4041.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2486236453514c1908b805bb563d42b","title":"the best of reeves mortimer our rundown of their best moments","story":"Ahead of Big Night Out’s return, we go over the comedy duo’s work, including The Weekenders, Monkey Trousers and CatterickShowing a steadfast refusal to let it lie, Vic and Bob are bringing Big Night Out back to BBC Four. With an oeuvre containing everything from bizarre arthouse comedy drama to mainstream light entertainment, here’s the definitive ranking of Vic and Bob’s team efforts.An ill-considered attempt to produce a sketch comedy series befitting a mid-week slot on ITV. Ultimately as forgettable as any ITV sketch comedy that isn’t Spitting Image.The former TV-am weather presenter and Shooting Stars team captain seemed an unlikely muse for the duo, and this R\u0026ampM-written pilot did little to dispel such suspicion.With Shooting Stars having been binned by the Beeb, Vic and Bob popped up on Channel 4 with a panel show that was essentially Shooting Stars minus most of the charm.Following the (then) web-only success of Alan Partridge’s Mid-Morning Matters, beer brand Fosters offered R\u0026ampM an online sketch vehicle. Expectations evaporated on seeing comedic fare as unsatisfying as last night’s leftover lager.Straight-to-video effort telling people how to behave behind the wheel, told through the misadventures of R\u0026ampM’s comic creations. Sadly, as fun as resitting a DVLA theory test.REEVES AND MORTIMER. Save energy when offered a gig acting out Viz Top Tips by pointing out they only work in the pages of Letterbocks.A pre-Big Night outing providing a buffer between New Cross function rooms and TV stardom, with a segment dubbed “the tallest game show in television history”.Music-themed pilot offering live performances interspersed with pop-themed R\u0026ampM riffola. A fun, if low-energy effort that offered up the comic stylings of Leeds rockers Cud.Underrated remake of the iconic ITC series, with Reeves as ghostly gumshoe Marty and Mortimer as bereaved colleague Jeff. Critically overlooked, but sharp scripting by showrunner Charlie Higson easily offsets the occasionally iffy acting ability of the leads.An off-kilter offering for Saturday teatime telly, this family themed gameshow tasked contestants with party pieces such as ‘fighting a garden shed’ or using a treadmill while carrying Leo Sayer. Only the one series, but an undoubted teatime treat for devotees.A slapstick-slathered sitcom offering a superficially traditional sit (Mortimer as fastidious homeowner, Reeves as his reckless lodger), with some chaotic content within those walls making for an unlikely fan favourite.A panel show unlike any other, not least in that the panellists’ presence was purely coincidental, acting as targets for Vic and Bob’s trademark tomfoolery. Not everything worked – Vic’s lascivious leg-rubbing at female guests now looks decidedly uncomfortable – but unmissable at its peak.While hardly adhering to the formula people had come to expect from the duo – frying pans in faces dominated the desk segments a tad too heavily – BBIR\u0026ampM provided ample evidence the guys could still provide quality product. If nothing else, The Club’s crackpot compere Kinky John Fowler is as good a comic creation as anything they’ve ever written.Comic drama-cum-musical following ex-serviceman Carl Palmer (Mortimer) as he attempts to reconnect with estranged son Paul, enlisting the help of oddball brother Chris (Reeves basically dressed as Peter Sutcliffe), their collaborative caper taking in theft, murder, romance and a pilfered penis. The combination of a great supporting cast and the inclusion of NYPD (that’s North Yorkshire Police Department) DI John Fowler, made for a rambunctious romp from first to last.The format that brought Reeves and Mortimer to the attention of a nation, or at least the chunk of it found watching Channel 4 on a Friday night. Ostensibly a showcase for ‘Britain’s Top Light Entertainer and Singer’, the whimsical whirlwind within – utterly at odds with the alternative comedy generally found in such a slot – bewildered many of the viewing public, yet within weeks an enduring cult was born.Part of sitcom pilot strand Bunch of Five, odd couple Jim (Vic) and Bob (Bob) set off for a weekend at a meat festival, taking in encounters with bejumpered bullies, police chases and an alien queen en route. It’s clear how much of this is a labour of love for the duo, not a single second is wasted with gags crammed into every last cranny. Sadly, there wasn’t a full series – Frank Skinner misfire Blue Heaven got that nod – but at least The Weekenders is now available at 4 On Demand.The pinnacle of Vic and Bob, the essence of the duo in its purest form. The first fruit from the duo’s move to Auntie Beeb and that increased budget is put to great use, with delightfully wordy opening introductions by voiceover icon Patrick Allen blending into full-length song and dance numbers, luxurious flights of fancy and a collection of characters that never failed to delight. Midlands miscreants Slade in Residence, sociopathic folk duo Mulligan \u0026amp O’Hare, cockney canines Greg Mitchell \u0026amp Corky have provided a timeless treat for the ages.Did you agree with our ranking?

Investigators are no longer bound by their side of the deal, which included a reduced sentence for crimes Manafort previously admitted, Mueller said.Manafort, 69, denied Mueller’s new allegations. “He believes he has provided truthful information and does not agree with the government’s characterization or that he has breached the agreement,” Monday’s court filing said.Both sides agreed that in light of the cooperation agreement’s collapse, judge Amy Berman Jackson of the federal court in Washington DC should proceed with sentencing Manafort, who could now face more than a decade in prison.Mueller said his team would file a comprehensive account of Manafort’s “crimes and lies” to the court for consideration in the sentencing. Manafort has been imprisoned since June, when his bail was revoked and he was charged with witness tampering.The latest remarkable turn in the Trump-Russia inquiry came only hours after a new attack against Mueller was posted on Twitter by the president, who has the power to pardon Manafort for any federal crimes – including those already admitted by Manafort and those alleged by Mueller on Monday.Mueller is investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election, which US intelligence agencies concluded was aimed at boosting Trump’s bid for the White House, and any collusion between Russian operatives and Trump campaign team.Trump, who has repeatedly accused the special counsel of targeting him in a “witch-hunt”, claimed on Monday: “There was NO Collusion \u0026amp Mueller knows it!”It was not immediately clear whether Mueller had suffered a setback on Monday. While the special counsel lost the cooperation of one of Trump’s most senior campaign aides, his court filing indicated that he had information that Manafort did not know he had – and that it was damaging enough for Manafort to lie about.The “detailed sentencing submission” promised by Mueller on Monday could also allow him to disclose any evidence of collusion he has uncovered without needing to go through a formal process of reporting to the attorney general. Earlier this month Trump appointed Matthew Whitaker, a sharp critic of Mueller, as acting attorney general, after firing Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from the Russia inquiry.Manafort agreed in September that he would assist government prosecutors with “any and all” matters, briefing them about “his participation in and knowledge of all criminal activities”. He also agreed to turn over documents and testify in other cases.As part of the deal, Manafort pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the US and conspiring to obstruct justice, in relation to his unregistered lobbying work for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. Other charges against him were dropped.By then, Manafort had in August been convicted of eight counts in a separate fraud case brought against him by Mueller in Virginia. Manafort is scheduled to be sentenced in the Virginia case in February.Trump’s legal team claimed to have remained in contact with Manafort during the former campaign chairman’s cooperation with Mueller, which if accurate would be a highly unusual arrangement.The collapse of Manafort’s cooperation agreement also followed the submission by the president of written answers to questions from Mueller."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/656de1eb159b613e647a3ffede2a200fe1f41cad/0_627_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68744e6a4014f1e48c20f574e101e543","title":"ireland closes peat bogs climate change","story":"Shift to renewables is too late say campaigners as peatlands will still emit greenhouse gasesWhen the semi-state company that harvests Ireland’s peatlands recently announced the closure of 17 bogs, the news was greeted as the end of an era. Turning the soggy landscape that covers much of Ireland’s midlands into a fuel source had been a great national project, an ambitious undertaking launched by the republic’s founding fathers in the 1930s. Draining and cutting hundreds of thousands of hectares of turf on an industrial scale generated desperately needed jobs and reduced dependence on oil imports for almost a century.So there was some nostalgia last month when Bord na Móna, the peat-harvesting company, announced it was closing 17 of its “active bogs” and would close the remaining 45 within seven years. Nostalgia but also acceptance, given the growing awareness that harvesting peat emits greenhouse gases that worsen climate change, requiring a shift to renewable energy. “Decarbonisation is the biggest challenge facing this planet,” said Tom Donnellan, the company’s chief executive.The announcement followed promises by the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, to make Ireland a global leader in protecting the planet, backed by a €22bn (£19.5bn) government plan for climate action. A progressive force on social issues, Ireland would also become a beacon for the environment.The problem, according to environmentalists and academics, is that it is all hot air. Renouncing bog harvesting, they say, is too little, too late – a false solace because the ravaged peatlands will continue to emit greenhouse gases. And the government’s climate leadership pledge, they say, does not cancel out a dismal environmental record that has left Ireland potentially facing up to €600m in fines for missing emissions targets.John Sweeney, a climate expert and geography professor at Maynooth University, said: “Climate change requires long-term thinking but the political cycle is much shorter and that of economically vested interest groups is shorter still.”Peatlands, formed by the accumulation of decayed vegetation, help regulate the climate by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing carbon within the peat. As fuel, it is more damaging than coal, generating less energy when burned while producing higher carbon emissions. Depending on how it is calculated, the peat industry contributes between 3m and 6m of the 62m tonnes of greenhouse gases that Ireland emits each year.Pat Sammon, a spokesman at the company’s headquarters in Newbridge, County Kildare, on the edge of the 370 sq miles of the Bog of Allen, said: “We’re heading to a new era because the main business of the company had been extracting peat and that’s falling away now.”But environmental experts are unimpressed. “It’s a bit of a smokescreen. It’s all revenue-driven,” said Florence Renou-Wilson, a research scientist and peatland expert at University College Dublin. Bord na Móna was closing bogs that were exhausted and no longer profitable, she said. “They’re all done and dusted.” The company was seeking new markets for peat in horticulture, she said, and, worse, it seldom “re-wet” used bogs, so the ravaged land continued to emit greenhouse gases. “They’ve just been leaving them abandoned.”Harvested peatlands – Bord na Móna’s as well as those developed by private operators – produce about 2.6m tonnes of “fugitive” emissions a year. Rehabilitation could make many of the bogs carbon neutral or even carbon sinks. Catherine O’Connell, the head of the Irish Peatland Conservation Council, said Bord na Móna’s decarbonisation talk was spin. “It’s genius what they’ve done. They’ve come out of this looking green. But they’re miners – they remove the living surface of the bog and dig down. Death by a thousand cuts.”As an environmental policy goal, ending the cutting and burning of peat should have been “low-hanging fruit”, said Tony Lowes, the director of the group Friends of the Irish Environment. “But we have struggled to truly bring it under control because of its emotional attachment and cultural heritage.”Environmentalists say this fits a pattern of state authorities ducking climate commitments. Ireland emits 13 tonnes of greenhouse gases per person a year, the third-highest level in the EU. The UK emits eight tonnes per person.Last month, David Boyd, a UN special rapporteur on human rights, said Dublin’s failure to tackle climate change breached human rights. He made the comments in a legal submission to support a court case brought by Friends of the Irish Environment, accusing the government of “knowingly contributing to dangerous levels of climate change”.Earlier this year, Varadkar raised expectations of a rise in carbon tax, widely seen as a basic, vital step to curbing emissions. But last month’s budget left it unchanged at €20 a tonne.Critics said the government flunked climate commitments for fear of a voter backlash, a pattern set when it backed a dramatic surge in dairy and beef farming, pleasing rural voters and business interests but derailing emission goals.Richard Bruton, the minister for climate action and environment, acknowledged last week that Ireland was “far off course” and announced a plan to make every department responsive to climate change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b10193a77a0310ce7239753cdc769dab37d6fd9f/0_60_4712_2829/master/4712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4518d272db6898c6863c30993e71876","title":"tuesday briefing manafort lies mean plea deal is off says mueller","story":"Trump-Russia figure could face heavier sentence … president’s take on Brexit deal doesn’t help May … and how to handle your money, by our expertsHello – Warren Murray making sure you are switched on to the news this morning.Paul Manafort has committed further “crimes and lies” that invalidate his plea deal, the Trump-Russia investigator Robert Mueller has declared. The former Trump campaign chairman breached the agreement by “lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the special counsel’s office on a variety of subject matters”, Mueller said in a court filing, adding that his team would file a comprehensive account of the breaches for consideration in Manafort’s sentencing.Manafort pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the US and conspiring to obstruct justice, in relation to his unregistered lobbying work for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. Other charges against him were dropped. Manafort had agreed to help prosecutors with “any and all” matters, briefing them about “his participation in and knowledge of all criminal activities” as well as turning over documents and testifying in other cases.Investigators were no longer bound by their side of the deal, which included a reduced sentence for crimes Manafort previously admitted, Mueller said. Manafort has denied breaching the plea deal, saying through lawyers that he “believes he provided truthful information”. Mueller is investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election and any collusion between Russian operatives and the Trump campaign.

The Cabinet will on Tuesday consider a report from independent auditor Peter Smyth into the tender process for the State’s rural broadband scheme. It will be published after the Cabinet meeting, with Minister for Communications Richard Bruton expected to make a statement.Following Mr Naughten’s resignation last month,Taoiseach Leo Varadkar ordered the report from Mr Smyth to assess whether the national broadband plan had been compromised.The Roscommon TD resigned amid controversy over meetings he held with David McCourt, the American businessman heading up the Granahan McCourt consortium which is the sole remaining bidder for the plan. Sources said the report has found that Mr Naughten did not influence or seek to influence the conduct of the tender process in favour of Granahan McCourt Capital, or otherwise. It is also understood to make a similar finding with regard to Granahan McCourt chairman David McCourt and his meetings with Mr Naughten. The report is understood to be about 50 pages long and deals with meetings held not just between Mr Naughten, his staff and officials and Mr McCourt but with all previous bidders for the plan.At the time of his resignation, Mr Naughten was strongly critical of Mr Varadkar, who had asked his former Fine Gael colleague to consider his position. Mr Naughten is expected to make a statement later on Tuesday.Pat Breen, the Fine Gael Minister of State who also came under pressure because of his dealings with Mr McCourt, is in Nairobi attending the Sustainable Blue Economy conference this week.The publication of the report is anticipated to clear the way for the national broadband plan to proceed, despite some misgivings in government about its cost, which is understood to be nearing €3 billion. However, it is seen as extremely difficult politically not to proceed with the long-promised plan. It is not yet clear if Mr Bruton will on Tuesday declare that the scheme as envisaged should proceed. The talks are set to resume on Tuesday, with three sessions expected to take place this week. The parties will pick up where they left off last week, with a focus on the Department of Transport, and sources said the broadband plan could also be discussed this week.Fianna Fáil has consistently said health, housing and broadband are its three areas of interest in the talks."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3706749.1542882733!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"national broadband plan everything you need to know","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDenis Naughten: An independent audit found the National Broadband Plan has not been fatally undermined by private meetings the former minister for communications  had with the sole remaining bidder. Photograph: Cyril ByrneWhat is happening with the National Broadband Plan (NBP)?  It hasn’t been abandoned, that’s what. An independent audit of the process has found that it has not been fatally undermined by private meetings the former minister for communications Denis Naughten had with David McCourt, the Irish-American businessman who is leading the sole remaining bidder for the contract. That report has not been published yet, but reports say it has given the process the go-ahead. It’s expected the full report will be published later this week or early next week.So what happens now? The tender for the project, submitted by the group led by McCourt, is being assessed by officials in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. It is reportedly 20,000 pages long and the assessment process involves examination by legal and technical experts. The Government expects to be in a position to make a decision on the awarding of the contract within a few weeks.Who are the other bidders? There aren’t any.Really? Other bidders, including telecoms company Eir and a consortium involving the ESB, all dropped out, leaving McCourt’s bid as the only one.If there’s only one bidder, isn’t that likely to push up the price? This is one of the fears – though there are others – in Government. The original estimates for the cost to the exchequer of the programme were in the region of €500 million. However, Government sources have told The  that the estimated costs for the project have ballooned – with some fearing the final cost could be as high as €3 billion. This has caused alarm in the Department of Finance, whose job it is to be alarmed about these things. These estimates have been disputed by industry figures, but they are the sort of sums that have featured in discussions on the broadband plan in Government.Is that for the entire country? No. Most of the country is covered – or will be covered – by commercial operators. The National Broadband Plan is just for remote and rural areas that the commercial telcos won’t touch because they can’t make them pay. So the State has promised to step in and provide high-speed fibre-optic broadband for the remainder of the homes and premises in the country. There are about 540,000 homes and premises covered by the NBP.What are the other concerns? There are two principal ones. The first is that the take-up of broadband services when the network is built is highly uncertain. Many of the 540,000 houses desperately want broadband. But some of the houses are holiday homes. Some of them are unoccupied. Some of them are home to people who aren’t that interested in having broadband. Government sources point to the example of Eir, which has offered, it says, broadband to 200,000 rural homes so far. The take-up is about 14 per cent. Broadband campaigners say that the Eir service isn’t actually available for everyone, but even still, the take-up is pretty low. Some people in Government are worried that they are going to build this network at great expense and only a minority of people will use it. The second issue is the ownership of the network once it is built. Although the State will have paid for it, the actual network – the pipes and wires, etc – will be owned by the company that builds it.Will the Government swallow its reservations? It will have to decide in the coming weeks, once the legal and technical evaluation of the bid is completed by the Department of Communications. It is not obliged to accept the bid, but refusing it would mean the entire project goes back to square one. That would be a huge embarrassment to the Government, and a political hit in rural areas. The choice is between making a decision that many in Government to be financially unwise, and one that is politically unwise."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

Commentators described the landing as “perfect” and “flawless”.Debris is seen on the lens in the first image from NASA\u0026#39s InSight lander after it touched down on the surface of MarsAnd in a final crucial phase, Nasa said InSight signalled to Earth that its solar panels - twin solar arrays ning seven feet (2.2 meters) in width - had opened and were collecting sunlight on the surface of Mars.The InSight team can rest a little easier tonight now that we know the spacecraft solar arrays are deployed and recharging the batteries, said Tom Hoffman, InSight\u0027s project manager.Over the next three months, Insight will deploy instruments designed to probe beneath the Martian surface before it begins to collect information about the planet\u0027s deep structure.Three of those instruments were designed and built by engineers at Imperial College and Oxford University and will listen out for Marsquakes which could hint at the likelihood of previous life on the planet.A view from NASA\u0026#39s InSight lander after it touched down on the surface of MarsOver the course of two years, scientists expect to detect between a dozen and 100 of the tremors, which could range up to six on the Richter scale.If successful, the three-legged probe, which launched from California on May 5, will help scientists learn about how rocky worlds like the Earth and Moon formed more than 4.5 billion years ago.The remains of a liquid core could suggest that Mars once had a magnetic field, which would have protected it from harmful solar winds billions of years ago at a time when the planet was warmer and wetter and might have been capable of harbouring early life.The UK Space Agency has invested £4 million in the probe\u0027s short period seismometer (SEIS-SP).An illustration of Nasa\u0026#39s Insight lander about to land on the surface of Mars.The British team, led by Professor Tom Pike at Imperial, said: We should be listening for Marsquakes for at least two years, and we hope considerably longer.It is critical that we set down the instrument in the best place to ensure we\u0027re stable, and then follow up with adding a cover to shield our sensors from the wind.Colleague Dr Neil Bowles, from Oxford University\u0027s Department of Physics, said: The InSight SEIS-SP seismometer is one of the most sensitive and challenging instruments we have worked on for spaceflight in Oxford.Only around four in 10 missions ever sent to the Red Planet have been successful - and they have all been US spacecraft.The European spacecraft Schiaparelli smashed into the planet in 2016 after switching off its retro-rockets too early, scientists believe.It was testing the landing system for a British-built rover to be launched on the second phase of the ExoMars mission in 2020.Back on earth, we will now have to be patient for results from InSight\u0027s mission.While the first pictures of the landing site arrived shortly after touchdown, it will be at least 10 weeks before the science instruments are deployed to begin experiments.It will then be another several weeks for Martian thermometer to dig into Mars. In total, the mission is intended to last two years - or one full Martian year.Read all the details of the full mission here The UK Space Agency invested £4 million in the short period Seismometer (SEIS-SP) on board InSight to measure seismic waves from Marsquakes.Scientists expect to detect anywhere between a dozen and a hundred of these tremors up to 6.0 on the Richter scale over the course of two years.Sue Horne, Head of Space Exploration at the UK Space Agency, said: It is wonderful news that the InSight spacecraft has landed safely on Mars.The UK scientists and engineers involved in this mission have committed several years of their lives to building the seismometer on board, and the descent is always a worrying time.We can now look forward to the deployment of the instrument and the data that will start to arrive in the new year, to improve our understanding of how the planet formed.The lander has sent its first image of its surrounding, confirming to scientists on earth that it has landed safely and is unimpeded by rocks on the surface of Mars. The first image sent from InSight on MarsWe have one more step that we have to do. We have to let the dust settle quite literally, we\u0027re going to kick up a lot of dust when we land, we need to let that dust settle before we want to unfurl our solar ray, he said.We\u0027ll definitely have a celebration ... but we\u0027re going to have to temper that just a little bit while we wait about five-and-a-half hours to know absolutely for sure we\u0027re in good shape.Touchdown has been confirmed for the InSight lander on the surface of Mars. Nasa\u0027s control room has erupted with celebration.InSight has now entered Mars\u0027s atmosphere, starting its tense landing phase.The lander has cleared the peak of its deceleration from 12,300mph to 5 mph before it lands. Parachutes have now been deployed and the craft is monitoring the ground below it. Nasa\u0027s InSight lander has now separated from the cruise stage that protected it on its journey through space.Next, it enters Mars’ atmosphere.InSight is short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport. As its lengthy name suggests, its objective is to dig into the planet\u0027s interior.One experiment is intended to take Mars\u0027 temperature by drilling down 16 feet (5 meters) into the planet, using a self-hammering nail. Another will calculate Mars\u0027 wobble, providing information about the core of the planet as the sun and its moons pull on Mars.When InSight drills down into the Martian soil, we\u0027ll learn more about how Mars and Earth formed.We\u0027ll know more about where we all came from, and why these two rocky worlds are so similar yet so different, Bill Nye, CEO of the nonprofit Planetary Society, said in a statement. This illustration shows the InSight lander drilling into the surface of MarsDue to the distance between Earth and the red planet, InSight must be able to think for itself during landing and future explortaion experiments.Instructions sent from scientists to the craft would take eight minutes to be received. However today\u0027s landing is expected to take just eight minutes in total meaning the lander must be able to independently react to its surroundings. It\u0027s got its own brain, said lead scientist Bruce Banerdt of Nasa\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It\u0027s got an arm that can manipulate things around. It can listen with its seismometer. It can feel things with the pressure sensors and the temperature sensors. It pulls its own power out of the sun.Scientists at Nasa\u0027a Jet Propulsion Labratory (JPL) which heads up  robotic exploration so plays a huge part in today\u0027s landing are preparing to \u0027pass the peanuts\u0027.A tradition, not superstition - this has become a staple in the day of major missions in which the Nasa team pass peanuts around the room for good luck. It stems all the way back to JPL\u0027s 1964 Ranger 7 mission. Prior to this, the team had suffered six failures, so the pressure was on. An engineer on the day of landing decided to hand out peanuts to his team, and after the mission proved successful, it caught on as a lucky charm. I thought passing out peanuts might take some of the edge off the anxiety in the mission operations room, said Dick Wilson, mission trajectory engineer on the Ranger team. The rest is history.A specially created jar of InSight misson peanuts inside the Mission Control Area (MSA) Life on Mars has long been a topic of fascination in Hollywood, most recently with Ridley Scott\u0027s The Martian starring Matt Damon. But in reality how will InSight\u0027s mission compare to the film?Professor Tom Pike from Imperial College London is part of the Mars InSight team which designed sensors to detect marsquakes. He hopes to pick up tremors on InSight\u0027s mission that will build a picture of Mars\u0027 interior and tell us more about how the planet formed. He spoke to us about InSight\u0027s mission and The Martian, and helped us distinguish fact from fiction. The countdown to the landing beginsThe InSight lander is under two hours away from landing on Mars.The Nasa spacecraft is aiming for an 8pm touchdown on what scientists and engineers hope will be a flat plain.Everyone involved in the $1 billion international mission is understandably nervous. They say they\u0027ve had trouble sleeping, and their stomachs are churning.It\u0027s risky business to descend through the Martian atmosphere and land, even for the US, the only country to pull it off. It would be NASA\u0027s eighth landing on Mars.We\u0027ll be bringing you all the latest updates here this evening as the space agency watch on with baited breath. Please review our commenting policyDonald Trump slams Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit deal as \u0026#39great for the EU\u0026#39 and warns it will harm UK-US tradeAcademic Matthew Hedges thanks wife in first comments since his pardon for \u0026#39spying\u0026#39 in UAEWho would poison a pride of lions?

Of course, that is emblematic of the progress women are making, but, in truth, this is not the place where business is being re-imagined.\u0026#34 Department for EducationJobs and employmentWomen who choose not to go to university are facing a bigger salary gap than men without degrees, new figures show, as Penny Mordaunt says the issue must be tackled.By the age of 29, men who complete higher education earn eight per cent more than men who don’t, according to the Department for Education and the Institute for Fiscal Studies.However, women who complete a degree take home 28 per cent more pay than females who haven’t been to university.Women and Equalities minister, Ms Mordaunt says that while there is a lot of focus on advancing women at the top levels of business, a closer look must be taken at how to help females at the lower end of the pay scale reach their full potential.One of the limitations is the disproportionate number of females in low-wage sectors. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that while 419,018 men aged between 16 and 29 work full time in the construction industry, only 44,444 women have jobs in that sector. In health and social work, which generally has lower pay, 665,287 women aged between 16 and 29 are employed, compared to 159,101 men. Another factor is that there are far more women working part time than men. ONS figures show that 1,202,375 UK females aged between 16 and 29 work part time, compared to 785,473 men.The ’s Women Mean Business campaign has shone a light onto the funding gap that female entrepreneurs face when trying to start a business. Currently, only nine per cent of the venture capital money that pours into UK startups goes to women.In a speech made to Bright Blue’s Women in Business conference, Ms Mordaunt said: “There’s a lot of focus on women in boardrooms. Of course, that is emblematic of the progress women are making, but, in truth, this is not the place where business is being re-imagined. Penny Mordaunt gave a keynote opening speech at the \u0026#39s Women Mean Business live event last month“If we want every woman to thrive, to be as financially secure and resilient as they can be, and to reach their full potential we need to broaden out our work beyond, the FTSE 350, beyond London, beyond executives, women on boards and big business.“We need a focus on small businesses, part time work, women from all parts of the UK, low paid women, women with multiple barriers to reaching their full potential, older women, financially fragile women, women who aren’t easy to reach, or measure, or sometimes even to see.“The invisible women who keep our families our public services and our nation going.”Universities Minister Sam Gyimah said: “I want to see our universities competing on the quality of what they offer, value for money and strong positive outcomes for their students so that every degree is worth the investment.“This landmark research proves that the graduate earnings premium remains robust, even as we have made higher education available to more young people than ever before. Higher education is delivering for students, the taxpayer and the economy, and will continue to do so as long as we focus relentlessly on quality.Women Mean Business | Read about our campaignDepartment for EducationJobs and employmentPlease review our commenting policyNasa Mars landing: InSight lander touches down on the Red PlanetDonald Trump slams Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit deal as \u0026#39great for the EU\u0026#39 and warns it will harm UK-US tradeAcademic Matthew Hedges thanks wife in first comments since his pardon for \u0026#39spying\u0026#39 in UAEWho would poison a pride of lions?

Simon \u0026amp Schuster paid a mid-six-figure sum for the rights to a three-volume series,\u0026nbspPublishers Weekly\u0026nbspreported in 2014.The original fan fiction version has garnered more than 1.5 billion reads on the online platform Wattpad, where Todd published them.The trailer for the movie adaptation shows American college student Tessa Young (Josephine Langford) falling for Hardin (Hero Fiennes Tiffin), a young, tattooed British man who is described as complicated by one of his friends.Several viewers criticised the clip, expressing concerns at the relationship patterns modelled by Tessa and Hardin\u0027s story.In Todd\u0027s fan fiction, the male love interest is described as grabbing Tessa\u0027s arm during an argument, and saying things such as I want you and I should be able to have you whenever I want to.At one point, Tessa, describing her lover\u0027s hand, says it is large enough to hold both of her wrists and adds: For a second I think he may slap me.After watching the\u0026nbspAfter\u0026nbsptrailer, one viewer called the film complete trash on Twitter.I truly hope y’all don’t go see that movie that glorifies unhealthy relationships, she added.Another person deemed the trailer lame and wrote: We love and support a toxic relationship and we love to romanticize abusers!One viewer wondered: Why did they make a movie about an abusive and toxic relationship?Some of Styles\u0027s fans made a point of highlighting the fact that the story is a work of fiction.This #AfterMovie is FICTIONAL.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearThe plummeting price of bitcoin in recent days has led to some cryptocurrency analysts joking that bitcoin has gone on sale, just in time for Black Friday.Bitcoin has fallen in price by around $2,000 over the last week, marking the latest losses in a turbulent year for the world’s leading cryptocurrency.Bitcoin price just hit new 2018 low as analysts predict reversalNigel Green, founder and CEO of financial services firm deVere Goup, recently said the recent price crash has created a buyers’ market.“Savvy investors understand that digital currencies are the future of money and, as such, they will be capitalising on the lower prices in order to build their portfolios and shore-up their positions,” Mr Green said.“Prices might fall further over the next few days, but we can expect a long-term upward trajectory for the crypto sector.”Some bitcoin exchanges are even offering bitcoin giveaways in an effort to entice people to their platforms.“Our mission is to make buying bitcoin quick and easy for everyone,” CoinCorner co-founder Danny Scott wrote in an email to\u0026nbspThe Independent. “We are delighted to provide new cryptocurrency users with a fantastic offer that will give them a great first experience into the world of bitcoin.”Bitcoin payment processor BitPay, has seen huge payment spikes on its network on Black Friday in previous years.\u0026nbspAnother company called Crypto Finally\u0026nbsphas even gone so far as to release a song for this year’s event.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSet to the tune of Rebecca Black’s ‘Friday’, lyrics include: “They don’t take cryptocurrency, they should take cryptocurrency, excuse me sir, what currency will you take?”The chorus concludes: “Everyone’s adopting bitcoin, don’t be a weirdo...

Almost a decade ago now he scandalised bankers and traders (although not the general public) when he declared the work of financiers to be\u0026nbsp“socially useless”.A few years ago he made himself almost equally unpopular in central banking\u0026nbspcircles by suggesting they should consider monetising debt to rebalance their economies.Between Debt and the Devil by Adair Turner, book reviewAnd now Baron Turner of Ecchinswell’s latest thesis is that politicians, everyone from the Chancellor Philip Hammond down, are talking rubbish about productivity.“What every politician always agrees is that the crucial thing we need to do is speed up the rate of productivity growth – every politician’s wrong!” the silver-haired 63-year-old declaims\u0026nbspin an interview with The Independent.Turner, whose technocratic career has taken him from the CBI, to the Climate Change Commission, to a major government review of pensions, to the chair of the Financial Services Authority, is now chair of George Soros’ Institute for\u0026nbspNew Economic Thinking. And the economic thinking he’s doing is certainly “new”. Downright heretical, many would say.So what’s led him to this radical conclusion that we should stop obsessing about productivity growth? The answer is twofold.First, he suspects automation is happening quicker than is being picked up by our official GDP statistics. Second, he thinks lots of the new service jobs being created as the mechanisable parts of the economy become\u0026nbspmore efficient are inherently “zero sum”, meaning they are competing for existing wealth rather than creating it.He gives an example of street sweepers and lawyers: “If we manage to create a totally effective automated street sweeping machine, nobody would have a job as a street sweeper. But if we apply IT to the limit to law, there’ll still be lawyers. It’s just that each of these two highly paid lawyers will now have software that review not simply many cases, but every single case that there’s ever been.“What do lawyers do? They fight against each other. If you make lawyer A and lawyer B both much more skilled than they were before, you can’t say there’ll be a better product, there’ll just be a more intense fight.”He thinks that focusing on productivity growth in this context will not help to deliver a higher quality of living for most people. Indeed, he fears it could actually end up harming living standards, citing the example of those who provide social care for the frail elderly.“What do we do with those jobs at the moment? We reduce their status and their cost. We put them up for competitive bidding. And we bid down the price. And then we do these gig economy games where people being paid to do social care of the elderly aren’t even employed for movement between client one and client two we say you’re only working when you’re at the client. Then we tailorise their life. We say ‘you’ve got 14 minutes to clean someone’s bottom’…”The solution, Turner says, banging the desk of his Mayfair office for emphasis, is simply to stop focusing on the bottom line.“We’ve just got to pay more for social care – we’ve just got to make something which is valued. We’ve got to pay higher taxes to afford it. They’re never going to be high-paid jobs, but we should not be using the techniques of the market to skinny them down.”He concedes the macroeconomics of his argument, laid out in an extensive lecture in the US earlier this year,\u0026nbspis unproven. There are certainly many theoretical and empirical challenges that could be mounted. He also accepts that his thesis – saying\u0026nbspwe should focus more on distributing the GDP pie than making it bigger\u0026nbsp– will not be easily swallowed by\u0026nbsppolicymaking classes.Turner advises a start-up online bank – OakNorth – which he says has influenced his views on the rapid underlying speed of job-shedding automation.As chair of a group called Energy Transitions Commission (ETC), made up of public and private sector experts and executives, he’s also advising governments in China and India on decarbonisation.Despite Donald Trump’s withdrawal of the US from the Paris accord, Turner insists he’s relatively hopefully about the prospects of cracking the problem of a rapidly overheating planet.“We’re optimistic that there are bits of Indian policy that are heading in the right direction,” he says.\u0026nbsp“I’m optimistic that China gets it, that they are determined eventually to bring down their emissions, that they’ll develop renewables on a massive scale, that they’ll electrify their bus fleets, etc.“The thing that frustrates me about climate change is that we could get to 2060 and we could have a pretty close to zero carbon economy. Run the numbers and it’s completely doable by technologies that we know how to do. It is soluble if we just get on with it.”But what’s lacking from Turner’s employment portfolio is a major, high-profile, public sector job in the UK. Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour seems an obvious fit. They could use someone with Turner’s economic and establishment credentials.And it turns out there has been some contact. On 19 May (the same day as Harry and Meghan’s wedding) Turner was to be found addressing Labour’s macroeconomic conference.Chair, Institute for New Economic Thinking since 2015But could he work with a party of politicians who\u0026nbspmany in the business world regard as\u0026nbspunreconstructed Marxists, a bigger threat to the economy even than Brexit?“The answer is I’d have to spend a bit more time,” he says, judiciously. “There are some things about some of the people around them of which I am suspicious. There seem\u0026nbspto be some people around them\u0026nbspwho genuinely do believe that Venezuela is a well-run country. You cannot believe that and be sensible. Venezuela is a disaster and it has been destroyed by a left-wing Marxist government that had oodles of oil revenues. You’ve got to say the way that the world is.”But he’s certainly not shutting the door.“There are things that make me wary of that tradition on the left which can see no problems with left-wing governments. On the other hand, there are other aspects of what they are saying that do not seem all that extreme or worrying.”The supreme British establishment technocrat taking a job with a radical left Labour team? That could be a Turner provocation to put\u0026nbspall his others in the shade.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

While Baroness Thatcher did work on emulsifiers in ice cream, among other projects, the\u0026nbspfrozen dessert\u0026nbspwas actually invented in America, more than a decade before J Lyons and Co partnered with the US firm Mister Softee to introduce it to Britain.The committee which will actually decide the person to feature on the £50 note has yet to consider the shortlist.A series of better-known scientists, including physicist Stephen Hawking, telephone pioneer Alexander Graham Bell and the discoverer of penicillin Alexander Fleming, are also on the list.Bookmakers have Mr Hawking as the favourite to end up on the banknote. Early computer scientists Ada Lovelace and Alan Turing, and the electromagnetism trailblazer Michael Faraday are also among those thought to be leading the race.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Artist Joseph Hillier and his sculpture - Messenger, depicting a young powerful woman, which will be unveiled next year for Theatre Royal Plymouth.

I\u0027m determined that a future government, a Labour government, will do things very differently including ending bogus self employment.”Creasy announce support for Stand With NG27 campaignMs Creasy added: “The decisions of the National Gallery and the ramifications of this case go far beyond what happens to the 27 iniduals who are taking on this class action.“It\u0027s really the test about whether our public services are behaving in an ethical fashion.Not just in the way that they pay people, but how they treat people when they want to make changes - and what this means in the world today when more and more people are being classed as \u0027self-employed\u0027.The group of 27 educators claim that in total they provided more than 500 years of service to the National Gallery. They welcomed school tours and members of the public to the institution and gave the daily programme of talks, courses and workshops about the works of art on display, as well as delivering learning sessions in schools and hospitals.While the National Gallery classed them as self-employed, the educators said that they worked regularly, were paid through the company payroll, taxed at source and were required to attend training sessions and appraisals. \u0026nbspWhen the gallery moved staff from temporary to permanent contracts, the educators claim they were dismissed with just eight permanent\u0026nbspcontracts offered to the group on reduced salary and terms.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Artist Joseph Hillier and his sculpture - Messenger, depicting a young powerful woman, which will be unveiled next year for Theatre Royal Plymouth.

And our case has the potential to be transformative as it is the first time this issue has been located within the public sector.“Marie van der Zyl, partner at Gordon Dadds LLP, the groups\u0027s\u0026nbsplegal representative, said: “Iniduals working in the arts are in need of certainty surrounding their employment rights and it’s essential to ensure they are categorised correctly.”The claimants have set up a page on the crowdfunding website Crowd Justice to raise funds for their legal claim, gathering £70,000 so far.Marie-Therese Ross, a claimant who worked for the National Gallery for 24 years, said: “This isn’t just about us. Our case highlights the exploitation of precarious workers across the arts and beyond.“We are standing up for fair employment rights and calling for our public arts organisations to value the expertise and experience at the heart of their education programmes.”​A spokesperson from the National Gallery said: “The National Gallery has been issued with a number of different claims from a group of freelance workers who have been providing a range of different services for the Gallery (and other museums and galleries across London) on an ad hoc basis for a number of years.The Gallery has not dismissed anyone as part of this process. The majority of the people involved are still providing these services to us on the same basis as previously, whilst others involved in these claims have already accepted either employment or new contracts with us.It is our understanding that the claims have arisen out of the National Gallery\u0027s choice as an ethical employer to change from offering ad hoc work to offering more secure employment, with additional pension and worker benefits.\u0026nbsp“This change also reflects our strategy to develop gallery programmes to reach new audiences and to enhance our engagement with visitors.”The entire group was consulted for their views about the change - both together and inidually - for a period of three months between October 2017 and January 2018.“Jobs were offered to all of our existing freelance service providers last year. We still have vacancies available, although unfortunately not all members of the group have expressed an interest in these.The National Gallery said that the case “should not be likened to the gig economy debate” and that the situation at the gallery was “the opposite”.“We have taken a deliberate choice to move towards a model that offers people secure employment, with additional pension and worker benefits,” the spokesperson added.\u0026nbspThe Central London employment tribunal is expected to rule on the case on 7 December.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The US president\u0027s backing is seen as key for the Middle Eastern kingdom as it seeks to avoid sanctions over the murder of journalist Jamal Khassoggi.Jack Allardyce, oil and gas research analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe said there was no obvious catalyst for the recent slump.“It seems to have been driven by a wider impending sense of doom amidst weak equities, geopolitics, subsequent softening demand and increasing supply,” he said.\u0026nbsp“A lot depends on both the result of US-Sino talks at the G20 this week, and Opec and it’s allies’ meeting on the 6th – it looks as though the market has already decided that the mooted 1.4 million barrels of oil per day cut to output isn’t enough to offset the decline in demand growth projections, so if that is the number then the current level could remain into the new year (or we might see some more weakness).\u0026nbsp“If they opt to make deeper cuts – which seems unlikely given how much the US is leaning on the Saudi’s and Russia’s apparent lack of enthusiasm – then some sort of recovery is likely. As ever, benchmarks seem to move more dramatically than they really should given underlying fundamentals.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Following an investigation, the Competition and Markets Authority\u0026nbsp(CMA)\u0026nbspsaid\u0026nbspit had found that PayPal “could face insufficient competition in the UK after acquiring its market-leading rival”. The CMA also said its findings “raise\u0026nbspconcerns that the merger could result in customers, which include small and medium-sized businesses, paying higher prices or receiving a lower-quality service”.Google’s various payment services streamlined into one platformTommy Robinson banned from PayPalDid Paypal founder buy his New Zealand home as ‘apocalypse insurance’?PayPal completed its acquisition of the Swedish company in September, and the CMA began its probe of the deal in October.If PayPal and iZettle cannot address the regulator’s concerns, the merger will be referred for an indepth investigation. Andrea Gomes da Silva, CMA\u0026nbspexecutive director, said: “Payment services markets are evolving, so it’s particularly important to look to the future when we assess competition and the effects of mergers on customers.“While iZettle is a relatively recent entrant to payment services, it has already established a market-leading position in mobile point-of-sale devices and was well placed to compete against PayPal in other emerging markets. “That’s why we are concerned that PayPal’s takeover could lead to higher prices or reduce the quality of the services available to customers.”A PayPal spokesperson said, “PayPal continues to work cooperatively with the CMA as it conducts its review of the acquisition of iZettle. We are now working to address the CMA’s concerns and demonstrate to the CMA that the market will remain competitive, so we can move forward with integrating iZettle into our global platform.”Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: “The fees that small firms incur when processing card payments can cause a real drag on profits and lead to higher prices for customers – \u0026nbspparticularly as businesses are no longer allowed to charge for card use. This is especially the case for firms that handle a lot of low value transactions: coffee shops, barbers, convenience stores.“The CMA is absolutely right to scrutinise this potential acquisition on behalf of smaller businesses. It’s vital that – if completed – the merger doesn’t lead to even higher prices for card processing services or stifle much-needed innovation.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The scale of impact that we have estimated will make it harder to achieve key public policy objectives.“Difficult choices, particularly about taxation and spending, will have to be made.

It is designed to inspire open and honest conversations about mental health by depicting each subjects inner battles on their facesOverall, 85 per cent of all students attend an institution that by age 29 is providing a significant boost to income –\u0026nbspbut this is only the case for around two-thirds of male students, the IFS found.One university in the Russell Group, which represents the most selective universities in the UK,\u0026nbspmakes\u0026nbspno positive returns for male attendees, the data shows.Attending university only increases average earnings at age 29 for men by 6 per cent overall.\u0026nbspFor women, however, it increases their average earnings by 26 per cent, the\u0026nbspstudy concluded.Chris Belfield, a research economist at the IFS and co-author of the report, said: “Overall, women have lower earnings growth than men. So the (economic) returns for a woman in going to university are relatively bigger than they are for men.”Men without a Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)\u0026nbspA-level, with lower prior attainment, receive even lower returns from attending university –\u0026nbsponly a 4 per cent increase in their earnings compared to peers who did not attend university.This group is more likely to take lower-returning subjects on average, end up earning less money\u0026nbspwhen they study the same subject, and study at lower-status universities.In 2016-17, just over 128,000 male students enrolled in creative arts, English, philosophy, agriculture, communications and languages – among the seven lowest-returning subjects. The number of male psychology students was not available from the Higher Education Statistics Agency.The earnings calculations were made by looking at the earnings of graduates from the middle 50 per cent of institutions – those in the 25th to the 75th\u0026nbsppercentile.The report also highlights great variation between courses\u0026nbspat universities. For example, men who study economics at the highest-returning institution see their earnings almost doubled – but at the lowest-returning university, the earnings for male graduates are reduced by 23 per cent.Mr Gyimah has called on the OfS to do more to expose the university courses that do not deliver value. He said: “We have got to put that out there so prospective students know –\u0026nbspand to force the university to actually delist that course, or actually improve the course.”“I believe that transparency is the best disinfectant here,” he added.The minister said\u0026nbspuniversities need to deliver courses that are employer-focused and\u0026nbsprecognised by the industry. “We have got to improve the quality of the university offering so that it delivers for students who are investing a significant amount of money into their education,” he said.A spokesperson for the National Union of Students (NUS) said: “There is a danger that, amidst calls for greater transparency in how fee income is spent, the ‘value’\u0026nbspof a degree is reduced to solely inidual financial outcomes. It risks neglecting the other substantial benefits that a university education can give to both the student and society.”They added: “Some of our greatest institutions –\u0026nbspsuch as Guildhall School of Music and Drama – attract the lowest financial return. This is because an arts career attracts a lower salary, not because of the quality of the university’s teaching. I find it hard to believe that anybody could argue that an institution that gave the world actors such as Daniel Craig and Jodie Whittaker is failing it’s students.“The government has already moved the burden of fee income entirely onto the inidual student, and now is threatening to limit the opportunities for young people to add to Britain’s rich cultural and artistic heritage by falsely conflating what a student earns with the value of their education to both themselves and society as a whole.”Created with Sketch.Best Universities for Life Sciences and Medicine Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyKarolinska Institutet, Main entrance from Solnavägen with the \u0027Aula Medica\u0027 in the backgroundUniversity of California, Los Angeles campusUniversity of California, Hastings College of LawYale University\u0027s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript LibraryUniversity of MelbourneUniversity of TorontoThe Geisel Library on the San Diego campus of the University of CaliforniaUniversity of SydneyUniversity of SingaporeMassachusetts Institute of TechnologyKarolinska Institutet, Main entrance from Solnavägen with the \u0027Aula Medica\u0027 in the backgroundUniversity of California, Los Angeles campusUniversity of California, Hastings College of LawYale University\u0027s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript LibraryUniversity of MelbourneUniversity of TorontoThe Geisel Library on the San Diego campus of the University of CaliforniaUniversity of SydneyUniversity of SingaporeAlistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said: “This study shows that for many people – and women in particular – going to university enhances both their employability and earnings potential.“However, the focus on what’s in someone’s pay packet at age 29 ignores the wider benefits of being a graduate: building networks, growing in confidence, developing life skills, the joy of learning as well as enhancing career opportunities and earnings over a lifetime, including a higher chance of being employed.”He added: “It is incorrect to assume all iniduals have higher salaries in the early part of their careers as their primary motivation. Many graduates work in vital roles in the public and charitable sectors or creative industries that make hugely valuable contributions to society and enrich our lives.“What this data highlights is the real need for those entering higher education to have the best possible information to help them choose what and where to study – but earnings are not the sole measure of learning outcomes.\u0026nbsp“Universities UK has called for the government to work in partnership with universities, colleges and schools to provide clear and tailored information to prospective students on the costs and benefits of higher education.”Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the OfS, said the new report showed there are still “clear financial benefits” in getting a university degree.“It is crucial that prospective students have access to high quality information about where, what and how they might study,” said Ms Dandridge. “This research provides a wealth of data to let students understand how the course and institution they choose may affect their earnings potential.”She added: “Of course, better financial prospects are only one reason why people go to university. Higher education also delivers important social and educational benefits to inidual students and society as a whole. There are also many rewarding careers that may not attract high salaries, especially early in someone’s career.“But universities should scrutinise this data carefully, and some will need to ask themselves tough questions about how well they are preparing students for life after graduation.”Office for StudentsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Mr Musk\u0027s rocket business is preparing for manned trips to Mars in the coming years, with the hope of making them relatively easily available.Do we really have a right to colonise Mars?You\u0027re 47, Mr Musk was asked as part of an interview for Axios\u0027s\u0026nbspnew show on HBO. What is the likelihood you personally will go to Mars?70 per cent, he replied\u0026nbspimmediately. We\u0027ve recently made a number of breakthroughs that I\u0027m just really fired up about.He went on to explain that he was talking about moving there, and that the price for the trip might eventually be only a couple of hundred thousand dollars.Pressed on whether he was working towards building an escape hatch for rich people, he said that the journey was going to be far more difficult than staying on our own planet would be.Your\u0026nbspprobability of dying on Mars if much higher than dying on Earth, he said, comparing it with Shackleton\u0027s trip to the Antarctic.It\u0027s going to be hard, there\u0027s a good chance of\u0026nbspdeath, going in a little can through deep space, he said.\u0026nbspYou might land successfully, once you land successfully you\u0027ll be working non-stop to build the base. So not much time for leisure.And once you get there, even after doing all this, it\u0027s a very harsh environment so there\u0027s a good chance you\u0027ll die there. We\u0026nbspthink you can come back but we\u0027re not sure. Now does that sound like an escape hatch for rich people?Despite all that he said he would unhesitatingly go and live on the planet, once SpaceX\u0026nbspmakes it possible.There\u0027s lots of people that climb mountains., he said.

This is an unprecedented move but it’s an unprecedented situation. We’ve failed to get answers from Facebook and we believe the documents contain information of very high public interest,”\u0026nbspMr Collins told the paper.Facebook had some “very serious questions” to answer, he said, and he accused it of misleading the committee over Russian involvement in the platform.“It has not answered our questions about who knew what, with regards to the Cambridge Analytica scandal,” Mr Collins said.“We have followed this court case in America and we believed these documents contained answers to some of the questions we have been seeking about the use of data, especially by external developers.”Facebook said: “The materials obtained by the DCMS committee are subject to a protective order of the San Mateo Superior Court restricting their disclosure.“We have asked the DCMS committee to refrain from reviewing them and to return them to counsel or to Facebook.“We have no further comment.”\u0026nbspThe move comes after Mark Zuckerberg said he was “unable” to testify to an international “grand committee” investigating Facebook’s role in spreading fake news.The social media company will instead send Richard Allan, its vice president of policy solutions, to answer questions at a hearing in the Houses of Parliament on Tuesday.Additional reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Try to peer back further, though, and everything changes. The visual, intellectual, spiritual, and day-to-day world of the age that came before seems maddeningly hard to grasp.Back in the 1930s, the authors of 1066 And All That captured something of the frustration: “Egg-Kings were found on the thrones of all these kingdoms, such as Eggberd, Eggbreth, Eggfroth, etc. None of them, however, succeeded in becoming memorable – except in so far as it is difficult to forget such names as Eggborth, Eggbred, Eggbeard, Eggfish, etc. Nor is it even remembered by what kind of Eggdeath they perished.”However, the low middle ages are not truly lost. Pre-conquest England is there – it is just well hidden. Occasional church towers or windows and museum cabinets of jewellery hint at a vibrant period, but it is in books and manuscripts that the Anglo-Saxons come vividly alive, delineated in everything from pale rusty ink to lush gold and lapis. In these texts we meet a vigorous and confident cast of warriors and saints, queens and kings, thegns and villagers, dragons and gods.Anglo-Saxon books are now spread all over Britain and Europe. In a moment of inspiration in 2013, the British Library decided to gather an unprecedented number of them together under one roof.Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms: Art, Word, War is now open, and its 180 exhibits froth and bubble with the whirlpool of fresh ideas and vibrant images that animated England for 700 years. With modern Britain unable to formulate a coherent 21st century identity for itself, the timing of this voyage into the past could not be more relevant.A quick reminder. Anglo-Saxon England thrived from the early AD400s to 1066. As Roman administrators and military commanders hitched their skirts, clambered onto boats, and waved “Valete!” to Britannia, boatloads of Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and Frisians eagerly arrived to fill the vacuum.\u0026nbspThe precise details of these migrations remain unclear. Some of the settlers may have been invited as mercenaries to fend off the raiding Scots (from Ireland) and Picts (from Scotland), while others almost certainly arrived to pillage and conquer. Many indigenous Britons were not thrilled. Warlords like Arthur (who may merely be an avatar for others) fought back hard. Yet despite the fierce resistance – the Historia Brittonum tells us Arthur alone slew 960 at the battle of Mount Badon – the settlers prevailed, put down roots, and built communities. Before long the newcomers from modern-day Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands had taken over, and Angle-land (England) emerged.The British Library’s timing is impeccable because the energetic imagination and international adventurousness of the Anglo-Saxons points to a profoundly dynamic period in which England buzzed at the intellectual, spiritual, artistic, and mercantile heart of Europe.9th century\u0026nbsp(British Library)Although there is little room for the Anglo-Saxons in crammed television schedules and bookshops already groaning with Plantagenets and Tudors, the Anglo-Saxons were every bit as important to the development of England. In fact, more so, as they founded it.“The Anglo-Saxon period was a formative one, both for the English and their British and European neighbours,” says Dr Levi Roach, a leading expert from the University of Exeter. “Be it in our towns and villages, our shires and counties, even our names for ourselves (‘English’, ‘Welsh’, ‘Scottish’), they have left an indelible mark.”If you look hard enough, life in modern Britain still has countless legacies of the Anglo-Saxons. Undoubtedly their most important bequest was their language: Ænglisc. (In Old English “sc” is pronounced “sh”, as in biscop or scip.) While the language has always been important in Britain and was exported to the New World and empire, its significance has grown even more in the last generation, with globalisation establishing English as the planet’s emerging lingua franca.This is very likely the first time in their long history that the codices have been together in the same place it’s easy to imagine them as in dialogue with one anotherEnglish may now be ubiquitous, but we rarely credit the Anglo-Saxons for its deep beauty and profound flexibility. For many – like the prime minister – “Anglo-Saxon language” is merely a periphrasis for swearing. This is a pitiful characterisation. Anglo-Saxon (these days rebranded as Old English) is the bedrock of modern English. And actually, there is no evidence any Anglo-Saxon ever uttered the F-word, the notorious monosyllable, or a wide range of other four-letter words.When we want to laud the beauties of historic English, instead of celebrating Anglo-Saxon, we usually skip straight to Shakespeare and the King James Bible. But while both have given us shimmering words and phrases, they were doing no more than wrapping ropes of fairy lights around an already solid, beautiful, old\u0026nbspand leafy tree. The fact is that long before the Globe Theatre rocked with applause, and even before Chaucer’s pilgrims met at the nearby Tabard two centuries earlier, the Anglo-Saxons were speaking and writing the earliest, luscious English.\u0026nbsp“English is a Germanic language,” explains Dr Alison Hudson, co-curator of the British Library’s exhibition. “Anglo-Saxon is the basis of some of its vocabulary and structure.” But the Anglo-Saxons were also devoted linguistic magpies, adept at incorporating new words and ideas. “One of the language’s unique marvels is its flexibility to absorb other elements, like Latin, Old Norse, and Norman French. In this period, we see loan words like ‘pepper’ and ‘cinnamon’ coming into English for the first time. It’s a wonderful reflection of the fact that the British Isles have always been a multicultural place. They even had the word ‘ylp’ for elephant. It’s one of my favourite Old English words. They had no idea what one actually looked like – they imagined it had white polka dots on pink skin – but it was an important enough part of their intellectual world to create a word for it.”Language weaves its way through the exhibition in a similar way to the bright swirls of decoration burnishing many of the old pages. At the dawn of the Anglo-Saxon era we see jagged runes cut into objects from a time when daily life revolved around the old gods and goddesses. As, in a small way, ours still do. Tiw, ruler of sky and war, is still honoured by a day of the week, as is Woden, head of the gods, Thunor, the thunder god, and Frige, goddess of the home and love. Some of these inscriptions are charmingly timeless, like the discreet marketing on the reverse of a piece of delicate gold, ivory, and garnet jewellery: “Luda repaired the brooch”.Æthelberht of Kent’s law code, composed around 600 (Dominic Selwood)The Anglo-Saxons did not cling to the old Germanic gods for long. In 597 St Augustine arrived to re-Christianise England, and one glass case holds an astonishing 6th century book of the four gospels, in Latin, believed to have been in his luggage.Augustine and his companions persuaded the Anglo-Saxons to adopt the religion of Rome, and the new converts became some of its most devout followers. Christianity was a book\u0026nbspand writing-based religion, and the old runes fell into disuse as Anglo-Saxon scholars adopted the Roman alphabet for Latin and Old English. For a while, though, runes clung on in places. The exhibition has a replica of the 5.5-metre high Ruthwell Cross with its spectacular carvings from the life of Christ, along with several verses incised in runes evoking lines from “The Dream of the Rood”.The oldest proper text in Old English is King Æthelberht of Kent’s law code, composed around 600. It is the earliest known utterance of English law, and is the standout exhibit in the exhibition’s first room. It is an extraordinary reminder of just how old our quirky legal system is, with so much of it – including trial by jury – reaching back to principles of Anglo-Saxon justice.As you would expect, the exhibition features stellar examples of Anglo-Saxon art. The mesmerisingly vibrant decoration of the Lindisfarne Gospels (circa\u0026nbsp700) needs no introduction, but equally fascinating are the small words glossed in red ink under the main Latin text. They are in Old English, and represent the earliest known version of the gospels in the vernacular. Strange as this sounds, translating the gospels into English was not that uncommon. The Wessex Gospels – also in the exhibition – were widely copied English versions of the four gospels: something later Tudor scholars in the Protestant Reformation pretended to be undertaking for the first time.What’s amazing about the four great codices is that, for all their riches, they represent just an accidentally surviving tip of an iceberg of poetry long since lost to usThe cases of books in the darkened series of rooms are interspersed with artefacts conjuring up the Anglo-Saxons’ physical world. The Alfred Jewel has pride of place, as do objects like the 5th century pottery Spong Man, which is the earliest Anglo-Saxon sculpture of a person. There are also crowd pleasers from Sutton Hoo and the Staffordshire and Binham Hoards.When Anglo-Saxon England died as a political entity at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, embroiderers depicted the run-up and battle in 58 captioned scenes on 70 metres of linen. Many of its panels show daily life either side of the Channel, preserving one of the richest records of late Anglo-Saxon society. Although the political and military narrative in the Bayeux\u0026nbspTapestry is Norman propaganda – telling their story of why William had God on his side – it is notably sympathetic to King Harold of England, and one of the reasons may be that the embroidery was perhaps made by Anglo-Saxons in Kent. Anglo-Saxon needlecraft – opus anglicanum (English work) – was world famous. The Bayeux Tapestry is not, however, in the exhibition, although President Macron has promised to send it for a visit in the near future, which will be the first time it has crossed the Channel in 900 years.The Anglo-Saxons were energetic travellers and traders, in constant contact with Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. In one glass case there is an astonishing late 4th century book that made it to Anglo-Saxon England all the way from North Africa – possibly in the baggage of Hadrian, a “vir natione Afir” (man of African birth) who travelled to England in 669 and ended up as abbot of Canterbury. In another is a gold coin minted by Offa, who ruled Mercia from 757-96. Although it predictably reads “Offa Rex” on the front, it is modelled on an Islamic dinar, with Arabic writing on the back including “there is no God but Allah alone”. With travel came a thirst for knowledge, and the Anglo-Saxons were also scientists. Books in the exhibition contain diagrams of the planetary orbits and affirmations that the Earth is round.For the real soul of the Anglo-Saxons – the rhythms of their lives, loves, and deeds – there is one standout case. In it are just four books whose names will have any manuscript nerd’s pulse racing. The first is the British Library’s own Cotton Vitellius A XV. It is fire ravaged, but magically preserves the sole surviving copy of Beowulf. Alongside it lies the Vercelli Book – in Britain for the first time in 900 years – containing the only manuscript version of the mystical and haunting “Dream of the Rood”. Next to it is the Junius\u0026nbspManuscript from the Bodleian. Its poems have largely religious themes, and the page is open on “Genesis A”, which offers a good sense of their preoccupations with its nine mentions of heofan and helle. The final volume is the Exeter Book, on loan from Exeter Cathedral. It shimmers with dozens of well-known, ravishing poems, including “The Seafarer” and “The Wanderer”, and lies open on a riddle asking which creature eats words but gains no wisdom. (Spoiler: a bookmoth.) Apart from the transcendent beauty of the words and imagery in these four books, an equally extraordinary feature of them is that they contain around 75 per cent of all surviving Old English poetry.Spong Man, which is the earliest Anglo-Saxon sculpture of a person, from the 5th century (Dominic Selwood)“What’s amazing about the four great codices is that, for all their riches, they represent just an accidentally surviving tip of an iceberg of poetry long since lost to us,” explains Professor Carolyne Larrington, an expert in Old English and medieval European literature at Oxford. “This is very likely the first time in their long history that the codices have been together in the same place it’s easy to imagine them as in dialogue with one another.”The single manuscript copies of Beowulf and “The Dream of the Rood” witness the remarkably poor survival rate of Old English texts. This has nothing to do with either the amount the Anglo-Saxons wrote or the quality of their materials. They wrote prolifically, and their vellum and bindings were perfectly robust, as many books in the exhibition demonstrate, with thumping leather-tooled and richly gem-studded covers showing no signs of fragility.\u0026nbspThe loss of so much Anglo-Saxon writing has far more to do with the purposeful and systematic 16th century destruction of monastic and university libraries by the Tudors, whose religious policies saw bonfires and rubbish heaps made of books that referred to England’s medieval faith. Religious sculpture, too, was also decimated. The original Ruthwell Cross, with its extraordinary runic poetry inscriptions, was smashed into fragments by Protestant extremists in the 1640s, but was meticulously reassembled in the 1820s, and now stands inside Ruthwell Church in Dumfriesshire.\u0026nbspLater, a handful of notable figures tried to repair the damage and locate the books and manuscripts that had been scattered. “Despair over the fate of the contents of monastic libraries crossed confessional boundaries,” explains Professor Helen Parish, an expert in late medieval and Reformation history at the University of Reading. “The former Carmelite turned ardent evangelical, John Bale, had little sympathy with the trappings of monasticism, but still complained bitterly that the dispersal of the libraries was to the shame of the country. Matthew Parker, first archbishop of Canterbury in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, worked hard in the 1560s to recover lost books and records. His library at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, provided the building blocks for a new history of the English church, and a burgeoning sense of national faith and identity in which the Anglo-Saxon church was the cornerstone.”\u0026nbspOne especially notable feature of the surviving corpus of Old English poetry is the prominence of women characters. Hudson explains:\u0026nbsp“There are a surprising number of Anglo-Saxon epics of strong women. Biblical characters like Judith, saints like Juliana – a Middle Eastern martyr who battled and conquered demons – and royalty like the Empress Helena. In the Genesis poem in the Junius manuscript, even Eve emerges as a notably prominent character.”Strong women are not only part of the Anglo-Saxons’ poetic world. They were part of everyday life, too. Æthelflæd, daughter of King Alfred and wife of Æthelred of Mercia, was named “Lady of the Mercians” and did more to bring England together as a country than possibly anyone else. Her deeds are recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which sits in the same room as the four poetry books. Less regal Anglo-Saxon women’s lives are also fascinating. The exhibition has the late 10th\u0026nbspor early 11th century will of the noble widow Wynflæd, and it contains two arresting provisions. On her death she freed some of her slaves, but not Eadgifu the weaver or Æthelgifu the seamstress. And she could read, as she carefully passed on her prized collection of books.\u0026nbspIf asked to name an Old English poem, many people would nominate Beowulf. It is rightly one of the most famous stories in Anglo-Scandinavian literature, and the original manuscript does not disappoint. The poem’s 3,182 lines throb with a ripping tale of the warrior Beowulf’s mortal combat with the monster Grendel and his mother and, years later, with a dragon. The epic’s ability to transfix and delight wins new admirers every generation: most recently with Nobel prize winner Seamus Heaney’s free translation in 1999 and Hollywood warhorse Robert Zemeckis’s epic A-list motion capture blockbuster in 2007.\u0026nbspAfter Beowulf, the most famous Old English poem is “The Dream of the Rood”, in which the cross of the crucifixion tells its version of the passion story. It opens with the writer having a vision of the cross that will soon speak to him:Listen! I wish to tell of the best of dreams,\u0026nbsp(You only need to know two things to read it aloud: “æ” is pronounced “a” as in “cat” and “ð” and “þ” are both pronounced “th”.)\u0026nbspIf you read, it, two things pop out immediately. The first is that the sound and cadences are deeply rhythmical, and almost certainly mean it was recited to music. The second is that the phrases are built up with a hypnotic alliteration that is perhaps the most defining characteristic of Old English poetry.\u0026nbspIt is, obviously, more challenging than Shakespeare or Chaucer as it has many unfamiliar words and comes complete with case endings. We have managed to get rid of most of them in modern English, although a few like “them” and “whom” stubbornly remain. To add to the challenge, many Old English words have also changed their meaning over time. For instance, “spell” simply meant “story” to the Anglo-Saxons.Old English also had dialects which evolved. The main ones were based in Northumbria, Mercia, Kent, and Wessex, with Wessex eventually coming to dominate, as it was the language of King Alfred – who was a fervent promoter of literacy – and later of Ælfric, abbot of Eynsham, who wrote and standardised the language prolifically.Selwood)Despite the strange look and feel of some Old English words, there is no reason to be put off. It is not as alien as it may sometimes seem. Neither does it only live in universities, libraries, and museums. JRR Tolkien was an Oxford professor of Anglo-Saxon for years, and if you enjoy any of the vocabulary of Middle Earth, you are revelling in his profound skill at playing with ancient Germanic-style languages.\u0026nbspOther standout treasures in the exhibition include the pocket-sized St Cuthbert Gospel, which belonged to St Cuthbert of Lindisfarne (died 687). It is the oldest European book with an original intact binding, in this instance an exquisitely decorated red goatskin cover, all miraculously preserved by having been placed into the saint’s tomb alongside him.Another is the bible known as the Codex Amiatinus. It was produced alongside the St Cuthbert Gospel at Wearmouth-Jarrow but, by contrast, is vast. With a spine over a foot thick, it takes two people to lift it and is the largest book in the exhibition. It was once one of three identical copies, but Amiatinus is the only one to survive, as soon after it was finished Abbot Ceolfrith (died 716) took it to Italy as a gift to the pope, and its homecoming to England for the exhibition is the first time it has been back in over 1,000 years.\u0026nbspIn the final room of the exhibition, beautifully lit and residing in a central case, is the most famous book ever produced in England. At Christmas 1085, William the Conqueror ordered a survey of his country, its land, and how it was occupied. Foremost in his mind was – as so often with rulers in any age – the question of property ownership and how much tax he could raise from it. Thanks to the Anglo-Saxons’ meticulous organisation of England into counties and hundreds, the research only took his commissioners until\u0026nbsp1\u0026nbspAugust the following year. When it was all written up, the result was nicknamed the Domesday Book, from the Old English “domesdei” – meaning the Day of Judgment – because the book’s record, like that of the Last Judgment, was unappealable.\u0026nbspHistory books will be harsh on us for ignoring YemenA brief history of pop-culture feudsWhy your Halloween witch’s outfit is rooted in a gendered stereotypeOn one level, the legacy of the Anglo-Saxons is something that is better appreciated outside England. We call the world’s English-speaking countries the “Anglosphere”, whereas the French choose the more nuanced “le monde Anglo-Saxon”, hinting at a distinct historic, linguistic, cultural, and philosophical heritage.\u0026nbspThe French also have no real concept of “the Dark Ages”, and the equivalent period in France has no label implying that it was unenlightened. Of course, as the exhibition demonstrates unequivocally, there never was a dark age. It is a myth dreamed up by Whig historians wanting to believe that Europe collapsed from glory into barbarity with the fall of Rome, but from the Normans onwards the British Isles marched unstoppably towards ever more profound progress and civilisation. The other reason the French have no dark ages is, of course, that they did not experience a regime as violent with history and cultural property as the Tudors.It is shameful that we so often start our islands’ history and lists of kings and queens with William the Conqueror, as if before his arrival there was a void with darkness over the deep. Britain had spectacular cultures before 1066, of which the Anglo-Saxons were one. Theirs was an intense, vibrant, literate, artistic, creative, spiritual, intellectual, practical, adventurous, outward-looking, European world. It was also a prize well worth conquering, which is why Cnut the Dane seized the throne in 1016 and William of Normandy followed him 50 years later.

At six I wake in the box room bedroom at my grandparents that I’ve claimed as my own since coming to Cheshunt as a baby. Suddenly I’m 51: this is the last time I’ll ever sleep in this three-bed former council house on an estate on London’s northern edge. My paternal granddad Leslie died in 2014 and for over a year my nan Eileen has languished in a care home with worsening dementia, which means never again will she return to the house that for all those decades was the family home.After my grandfather returned from war, he, Nan and my infant father moved into a two-bed semi on a large estate being built for heroes called Bury Green: one of Nan’s ways to make ends meet was to clean the newly completed houses after the workmen had finished, walking the plank across muddy foundations, my father in her arms. When a larger, three-bed place came up further in they moved, the neighbours mucking in with hand carts.Empty houses are depressing, and this house has lain empty for more than a year it smells dank, there are cobwebs, and half the family photographs have been removed from the wall leaving a patchwork of anachronistic memories. Soon, when Nan dies, or her savings run out, this house, the sole childhood home of my dad, uncle and auntie – which my grandparents agonised over buying due to their socialist principles – will be sold. After half a century, I look round for a final time, and close the door.How a family hiking trip left me thinking about mortalityRecently I realised that dozens of places important to my family stretching back 100 years took place along the A10New River layline between Cheshunt and Soho. The birthplace of my father, two of my grandparents and my two children the places where I, my parents, and grandparents, met our partners and where we married several of my former homes, plus the ones in which my mum, dad and grandparents grew up schools and universities where me, my kids, my parents and grandparents studied and worked, are all strung along a 20-mile route which I have decided to walk in one day: a long trek into my past, back to the warm heart of my city.The November sun is rising over “New” River (dating from 1613) at the end of the street, the same street on which Cliff Richard was raised and whose forged autographs my father sold round school as a kid. Cutting through the alley where I learnt to ride my bike and where louts often linger with flickering lighters, I leave the estate, passing the graveyard where my great-grandmother Flo is buried, and cross the metal footbridge that crosses the A10, watching trucks and cars thunder to and from London.Being political animals, my granddad ran the tenant’s association, Nan the Labour women’s section. One day in the Fifties she invited an earnest young prospective candidate (who had no chance despite estates like Bury Green, Cheshunt was Tory) to speak to the Labour ladies about his policies. Nan was mortified by the way the other women sat, listened and carried on knitting, needles flashing and clicking like praying mantes. The pleasant young man was Dennis Potter: years later, Nan would watch his TV play Vote, vote, vote for Nigel Barton\u0026nbspand shudder with recognition.Piggott and his mum Flo in 1915\u0026nbspAs you walk east on College Road a huge tree – possibly a cedar of Lebanon – that has barely changed since I was a kid marks the start of Blindman’s Lane. Here, at 55, my paternal grandfather Leslie Piggott grew up in a bungalow without hot water, one of five siblings to Florence and Edwin Piggott, who were doubly blessed. First, because Ed was stone deaf, thus escaping the trenches second, because he was a nursery foreman which meant there was always food on the table – unlike many homes in what in the Twenties was one of the poorest rural districts in England. (Their luck would change: their only daughter died of cancer and their son Vincent was killed in action in the Second World War).Even when I was a kid – spending many of my school holidays in Cheshunt – the town had become a distant suburb of London, joined by the threads of rail, river and road, but back in the Seventies the town was overwhelmingly white Tesco ran the town like the Cosa Nostra. Today’s inhabitants are more erse and Turkish grocers surround the Old Pond in my granddad’s youth, the only Turk most Cheshunt people would have met would have been at Gallipoli.Piggott at St George’s Church in 1940\u0026nbspAt Old Pond roundabout – where Vincent Piggott’s name is inscribed on the war memorial – I turn right down Turners Hill, past the library where my grandfather worked as a teen before discovering the money in the factory was better, past the site of long-demolished Merston House where he was born in 1915. Turners Hill merges into Crossbrook Street, which runs down to Waltham Cross (still as ugly as the day I was born) and has another family connection. In 1944, when my father Michael was just two weeks old, my grandfather wrote him a letter from his RAF base:“On a certain April evening in 1939, my pal ‘Ginger’ Liddard and I were off for a stroll and a drink along Crossbrook Street to Waltham Cross. In those days, I’m afraid, I was rather a heavy drinker, but anyhow I’ll leave the explanation of my sins until later, so back to my story. We had just passed Cheshunt Building Society when all of a sudden we heard a ‘Hullo’ from the opposite side of the road, and when ‘Ging’ and I looked over we saw, what appeared to us in the dim light, a pair of very young girls. We stuck our noses in the air, said ‘schoolgirls trying to be funny!’ and passed on our way to the nearest pub. On our way back to Cheshunt we ran into the two ‘schoolgirls’ again, this time on our side of the road, and lo! And behold! They were not schoolgirls but very pleasurable young ladies of some 17 years of age…”Places change: so, too our perceptions. I used to associate Archway with pubs, kebabs and scary underpasses now sealed over but that was in another lifeOne of the girls was one Eileen Ball from Enfield. The pair began courting Nan was much impressed by Granddad’s good manners, smart appearance and relative affluence as a skilled toolmaker he earned double most of his contemporaries. In 1940, Granddad was given leave from the RAF where he now worked as a Spitfire mechanic beneath Guy Gibson to marry Nan at St George’s Church, Hertford Road. The photographs of their wedding day will be instantly familiar to anyone with English ancestry: grandfather in uniform, grandmother in white. Go into any English home and you’ll find variations on the theme: an ancestor in uniform, smiling uncertainly into the lens (not wanting to be at the centre of this or indeed of anything), a determined, set look keep calm, and if you come home carry on propagating the genes.St George’s has hardly changed, to my unpractised eye: red brick, imposing, small memorial garden out front where a mourning woman lays flowers. A couple of streets further down I pass Unity Road, where my father was born in 1944. Bombing raids were a part of life: years later my nan, an air raid warden in the factory where she worked, recalled:“When Michael was about six weeks old, early one evening, I was breastfeeding him when we heard the sound of what we thought was a hit plane coming down. I shot under the table in my mum’s dining room crouching over Michael, who, luckily, was blissfully unaware of the danger and went on suckling!”Unity Road is suburban, low-rise, and seems more affluent than the surrounding blocks. I have a photograph from May 1945 of a Unity Estate VE tea party, Nan holding my father in her arms (unmissable, due to her habit of tippexing outlines round family members in any group photos). Now, on the corner, perhaps on the very site of that street party, stands a vast Lidl.From Unity Road it’s a slog through scrofulous suburbs and a characterless stretch of the A10 (the factories in which Granddad worked – Murex, Thorns, Manifold – are now retail parks) to Bertram Road, Bush Hill Park. My nan was born at 104, and grew up at 122, poor, half her father’s weekly wage of £2 from Ediswans lightbulb factory going on the rent.Nan’s dad, Arthur Ball – a name I imagine caused some merriment in the factory – also worked in the factories up the A10. Enfield was heavily industrialised and would be a prime target during the war. One of Arthur’s workmates was Jimmy Dimmock: he worked in the factory all week, then turned out for Spurs of a Saturday. When unemployed, which was often, Arthur – teetotal, musician, talented painter – set up a group for dole-drawers in a hut. He sat Eileen on his knee when she was five and explained how everyone had a right to clean linen nan took it to heart. She left school at fourteen to help out and got a job at the same factory as her dad, where she was known like all the typists as an “office tart”,\u0026nbspand at dinner time Arthur would come through the rubber doors that separated classes (factory and office pool) with his trolley and give her jam sandwiches a taste of an older England long since gone to Pot Noodle.Despite her poverty, Nan’s memories of childhood are generous and rich, recalling games in the street, kids in and out of one another’s houses, evenings round the piano, doting grandparents nine doors down.The current occupier of Nan’s childhood home, Peter, generously lets me come in and see the place Nan was raised. Peter, a rough, friendly decorator of 53, and his wife have lived here for years but are shortly moving to Winchmore Hill.I’m surprised at the size of the house, with its big back garden and kitchen extension, and have to remind myself that when Nan lived here the extension wouldn’t have existed, and lacked even electricity, let alone flatscreen TV.From Bertram Road it’s a drab, dreary walk to Arnos Grove, passing through the middle-class ghetto of Winchmore Hill (where my mother grew up in the station house), the site of Minchenden Grammar (which Mum attended with Lynne Franks and Martin Rushent), Mum’s first place of work – the Metal Box Company on the North Circular – to the former council flat where her father, my maternal granddad, resides. All these suburban streets look the same, and I keep getting lost: at one low point I have to double back and walk a mile out of my way uphill. I’m less than halfway through my odd odyssey and exhausted, and for the first time begin to worry I won’t make it, chide myself for failing to do any preparation whatsoever – unless you count walking to the offie.Despite Granddad’s claims, the Piggotts weren’t drinkers and the Balls of Methodist stock so when it comes to alcohol, I must take after my mum’s parents. My mum’s mum, Kit Walsh, had to leave Ireland when she got pregnant there are rumours Mum has an older sibling somewhere who was given away. When I was born my nan was still only 36 she’d give me whiskey to help me sleep. Nan was what you might call a character, and great fun. On one occasion when I stayed as a kid, she came in saying she’d just met Jesus on the tube. We thought she’d finally lost it then it transpired she’d met Robert Powell and given him whiskey from the bottle she kept in her fake fur coat and taught him to sing The Men Behind The Wire.Now 95, Jack Brown has lived in a smart three-bed flat in one of the four-storey blocks for 50 years, raising with Kit six children. Many of my holidays as a child were ided between here and Cheshunt, between my two sets of grandparents. Today all the blocks are covered in scaffolding, making them seem grimmer than ever: there’s no entry phone and when I bang on Granddad’s door he shouts fearfully from within: “Who’s that?”“Me, Granddad. Mark.” (Adding, as always:\u0026nbsp“Sandy’s son.”)Granddad opens the door, looking every day of 95: he is short, as are all my forebears, five two, stocky, face still fierce, still with a purple boozer’s nose though he can no longer drink anything but J2O. He shuffles back to the lounge on his walking stick and we sit at his desk. Kit died at Chase Farm in 2008 a few years later my mum’s youngest brother, my uncle, five years younger than me, assaulted his dad and went to prison. An exclusion order remains in place, and now Granddad’s only visitors are a daughter and her partner. I ask Granddad how he is.“Not so good,” he growls, still with a faint Ipswich burr in his accent after all the decades. “I got robbed.” A week earlier, two young men posing as workmen on the renovation used fake ID cards to gain access one distracted my grandfather while the other took £400 he’d been saving to buy his communist chums a pint for his birthday. A few days later, just down the road, a 98-year-old was beaten almost to death for his TV.Granddad looks shaken, vulnerable: this family is no stranger to bleak times (Nan mugged on her way home from Bingo, Uncle Liam, stabbed, Uncle Liam, brain-damaged, Uncle Liam, diagnosed with MS, Uncle Liam – who gave me my middle name – who died this year), but I sense this might be the last straw. What a sad end for a man who stood as a Communist Party MP, who ed into burning seas to save Navy comrades after his ship was torpedoed, who worked for 40 years for British Rail, where he showed John Betjeman how to change signals and who once travelled to Moscow with Kit by train. Nan Brown often told me how they were invited to a grand ball in Moscow and as they ascended the sweeping staircase she hissed at my grandfather: “Jack! Your flies are undone!” “That’s nothing,” said Granddad. “You’ve got your dress tucked in your knickers.”Created with Sketch.The London that could have been Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Planned in the 1960s when bus use was declining and personal car use was increasing.

Now I recall Nan Piggott telling me of the reception at my mum and dad’s wedding, where my Irish nan’s contribution to the buffet was a string of uncooked sausages and where during a slow dance Jack slid his hand down over Eileen’s bottom as his wife suggested wife-swapping to shocked Granddad Piggott: two very different families, brought together only briefly in a ceremony at Haringey Civic Centre, my mum’s black dress bulging visibly, guests including Fairport Convention.Neither my mum or dad recalls the date they married (the marriage itself only lasted two years), but both recall where I was conceived: at a Socialist Labour League conference in Morecambe, shortly after friend-of-the-Redgraves Gerry Healy told Mum: “I will sleep with you on the eve of the revolution.”For a time, Mum and Dad lived in Rosebery Road, Muswell Hill, in a house with a shared bathroom Mum recalls bopping around the living room to Dizzy Gillespie as her belly expanded. Dad was quite the lad about town in the mid-Sixties: hanging out in jazz clubs and\u0026nbspshebeens, a groovy dude in velvet pantaloons. Once, he tells me, Rod Stewart nicked his dope another time he was on the door of a party in Chelsea when four scruffy looking louts tried to enter. Dad barred their way, to be informed he’d bounced the Rolling Stones. Dad got into an unspecified spot of bother and the young couple went north to Manchester, where I was born: a northerner in spirit but not a drop of northern blood.From Wood Green it’s another slog, through Hornsey and Crouch End and up the hill to Hornsey Rise, then right along Hornsey Lane, thoroughly exhausted now, wolfing eclairs and Coke, the unseasonal November sun blinding. Just before Suicide Bridge – immortalised, if that’s the word, in my first novel Fire Horses – a passing white van smashes the wing mirror of a parked van and the debris of glass and torn metal hits me: the van doesn’t stop. Nor do I. Standing on the bridge I look down over the bowl of my city, London proper.Empty houses are depressing, and this house has lain empty for more than a year it smells dank, there are cobwebs, and half the family photographs have been removed from the wall leaving a patchwork of anachronistic memoriesArchway Tower – where I used to sign on – has been transformed into an apartment block, reflecting the transformation of an area which in the 1980s – when I lived in a condemned row for three mostly unhappy years – was dubbed “where angels fear to tread”. We stuck the article on the wall, a badge of pride. Much of those years are now just a blur: dropping acid during the Great Hurricane, drinking with Pete Postlethwaite a blazing row with Kathy Acker.In my first published story, “Hatful of Holloway”, I imagined a terror attack in which Archway Tower is blown up and falls onto what used to be the Archway Tavern, a rough Irish pub where they cashed your giros at a counter and men waited each morning at six for the van to the site. The same year that story was published, I was at Archway Station with my wife and baby daughter when we heard about the 77 terror attacks: I remember looking down Junction Road, trying to work out the safest way home with our precious pram cargo, and suddenly it looked like a corridor of glass.Places change: so, too our perceptions. I used to associate Archway with pubs, kebabs and scary underpasses now sealed over but that was in another life. Crossing Highgate Hill, where Dick Whittington turned again, I walk down Dartmouth Park Hill, past the Whittington Hospital where two years apart our two children were born in the same delivery room, a continuation of a process of self-gentrification that mirrors the new N19, where plastered Irish builders have become Damian Lewis and Benedict Cumberbatch. My Irish nan drank in the Boston in the 1950s, telling me how anyone who refused to put money in the IRA collection plate was thrown out the window the Boston remains satisfyingly down-market, with racing on the TV and smokers congregating at the door even as goths queue for the Dome next door.Limping past Cathcart Hill, where I lived from 1999 to 2013 with my wife and then our two children after nine brief months in the country we were pulled back, to Finsbury Park (where, in 1987, I presented Network Seven and hung out with junkies on Six Acre and Andover) and then back to the manor, to Warrender Road, where we live today.Utterly exhausted I enter the house: my wife makes me tea and sandwiches, Daughter, 14, teases me about my bedraggled appearance Son, 12 shows me the game he’s been creating on his laptop. It would be so easy to sit here and sleep: but I have made a promise, to myself at least, so after dumping my bag I say goodbye and walk, past Mercers Road, the first house in London I lived in aged 18, where a regular visitor – much to my excitement – was Roland “Fine Young Cannibals” Gift, then at the peak of his fame. In the distance I see London Met on Holloway Road, where I took a degree 10 years later, and where, 10 years after that, my first novel was launched (and sank without trace).Past Lloyds Bank at Highbury Corner, part of which used to be a curry house above which I shared a room with my oldest friend which had no windows, and maggots on the carpet, and where we had to place a disconnected door in the door-shaped hole to allow the other to defecate in peace. Where, the day in 1991 I received the letter confirming I’d been allocated my own little flat, I picked up a bottle of cider from the floor, took a swig in celebration, then realised it contained urine.Highbury Corner, where the Islington Twins used to hang out, and those older, odder twins used to walk up and down in matching checked suits, and where I once slept in bushes at the centre of the roundabout, and The Cock, where Arthur Mullard made me get off his stool. Down Upper Street, past 127, the site of Brown and Blair’s infamous Granita Pact, which I mentioned in a novel past the red-brick Municipal Office where I both worked and signed on past the town hall where in 2003 my wife and I were the first to be married in the chambers: we appear on council literature. My mum and dad met just around the corner, at an SLL meeting: they saw eye to eye, not only politically, but physically, dad being 5ft 2in, mum 4ft 11in.Between them they were over 10ft tall.To the Angel and past Nags Head, for so many years our pub of choice: sometimes when I had no money I’d walk up and down Upper Street for hours, watching all the drinkers behind warm glass. Taking a right up White Lion Street I pass a Hilton, bemused: in the 1980s King’s Cross was still rough. Up York Way, we attended “acid rock” warehouse parties in 1986 today I turn south onto Amwell Street, passing the flats where I lived with J and her mum back in 1989-90 before it all fell apart (all me – my bad).Filthy McNasty’s – where I set a key scene of my first book, and once drank with Shane MacGowan – is now the George and Monkey. One night on mushrooms I had a bad trip there, and Amwell Street extended to eternity. At Roseberry Avenue I pass Finsbury Town Hall, where I was once best man, stinking drunk because I’d just been on the telly.Exmouth Market had pie’n’mash and jellied eels when I lived in the Peabody Flats (1991-98) I pass the pub where the blind man used to give his guide dog Guinness in an ashtray. Down the steps I staggered down a thousand times: in Australia, 1994, homesick, I was watching A Fish Called Wanda when I saw those same steps, my own flat. I look up at the tiny bedsit where I lived and died a thousand deaths, crushed by loneliness and rage some rainy winter Sundays I would walk from my flat to the Thames without seeing a soul, go days without uttering a word. I became so introverted, so lacking in confidence and self-esteem that I began to imagine a huge coat which as I walked through the snow would erase all my footsteps, leave no trace. But then Clerkenwell Green around the corner is where I explained to J that one day, I would be quite the catch, and she laughed and at Clerkenwell Green I learnt my first novel was to be published.I’d only been living in Farringdon Lane a few months when a new neighbour moved into the flat directly upstairs. By a bizarre coincidence it was J’s best friend D, with whom we’d once trekked across Europe D now worked as a childminder for Mike Leigh and told him about this strange event. A year or two later, when Naked was released, I was somewhat perturbed by the similarities between the Thewlis character and myself. Pure coincidence, of course though later, when D told me about Secrets and Lies and I asked if it was about her, D laughed and said – “No, Mark – it’s about you. Again.”When I first got involved with the magazine, I was also still vaguely involved with Class War, agitating at Wapping, appearing on page 2 of The Sun holding a misspelt banner when Princess Anne came to tour the youth project I was locked in a room because they were scared that I’d burst out with placards.Memorial for Sikh soldiers vandalised in first week after unveilingBrain implants will soon allow hackers to ‘manipulate memories’How memory can help build confidence in the kitchenIt has grown dark, and as I begin the final stretch to Soho in my long back coat, I feel invisible. Am I really here, or just another ghost in a city full of ghosts from Roman armies to Amy Winehouse? My steps and breath shorten the pain in my thighs, calves, feet, hips intensify: but now I know I will make it.I pass the Phoenix, site of my second book launch in 2010, when it seemed authordom was mine and easy. Eighteen months later I was back on the dole. As I limp up Shaftesbury Avenue each step is a torment, but now I see my destination just across the road, in Soho proper: The Coach and Horses.Why end here? Well, I had to end somewhere, so why not a pub – one I frequented when Jeffrey Bernard propped up the bar, and I had to restrain a mate from flattening Norman Balon who’d called him a cunt, and where, years later, for two short hours, I was part of the media aristocracy?Entering, I order a Guinness. The barmaid smiles and serves. I check my pedometer: 48,664 steps, 20.7 miles. No, there’s another reason I picked this pub.1999: My lowest ebb. Having graduated from college and secured an agent I borrowed £10,000 from a bank in anticipation of the advance that was surely coming, and never did. With fellow loons I drifted across the capital, drinking and taking whatever else I could find all night and day, sometimes sleeping rough at one point in Oxford Street I lay on the bonnet of a car and was carried for several hundred yards. Then, later, as police came to arrest me for causing a disturbance in my flats, I smashed my fist through a window and almost severed the hand entirely I was rushed to hospital but after being bandaged left again, still buzzing. Next morning a doctor removed the temporary bandage and I saw my severed wrist, tendons and veins dangling, like a robot I was rushed back to hospital for emergency surgery.A few days later I wandered into the Coach and Horses, Soho, where a pretty trainee nurse from Liverpool smiled and seeing my ragged, loose sling said in a kind voice:“Are you OK?”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

For decades protesters have demanded they be repurposed as social housing.\u0026nbspOliver Bennett unravels the highs and lows of a phenomenon with global foundationsClick to followThe IndependentSquatters occupy Centre Point, advocating its use as a residential block instead of an office in the SeventiesCentre Point must be one of the most isive landmarks in London. Erected in 1966, it instantly dominated the West End and while some celebrated it –\u0026nbsparchitect Erno\u0026nbspGoldfinger called it “London’s first pop art skyscraper”\u0026nbspand amazingly, likened it in spirit to The Beatles and Mary Quant – the brainchild of reclusive developer Harry Hyams has had a mixed reception over its 52 years.But perhaps Centre Point’s most curious fate has been to remain more or less empty. It never fully worked as offices. In 1972 Camden Council tried to requisition it. Harold Wilson wanted to nationalise it. It was occupied for a weekend by housing activists in 1974 – one was Labour politician Jack Dromey, Harriet Harman’s husband. A major homelessness charity was named after it. Then a Grade-II listing and a recherché desire for Brutalist\u0026nbspicons (it came from the feted drawing board of Richard Seifert’s master architect, George Marsh) bought its zig-zag façade back into favourable view and it become luxury flats, synced to the new Crossrail development. What could go wrong?Labour mulls plan to force landowners to sell cheap to stateWell, the Centre Point curse has struck again. In October its developer Almacantar decided that offers on its remaining luxury flats were “derisory” and “detached from reality”, and decided to take them off the market. So Centre Point has now cemented and updated its footnote in London folklore as one of the capital’s benighted\u0026nbsp“ghost towers”.From Centre Point to the Shard, from Battersea Power Station to the sky-reaching baubles of Nine Elms\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspeven in The Independent’s old neighbourhood in City Road – the past six years or so has seen London become filled with tall glass and steel icons\u0026nbspthat are conspicuously under-occupied: built in a time of optimism for an overseas market and now languishing unsold or OLE: owned and left empty.The problem is that housing is an extraordinary failure of the market. It’s an oligopoly that controls the supplyThe immediate prognosis is not good. It has been said that half the 1,900 luxury apartments built in London last year failed to sell, and it’s estimated that there are around 2,500 to 3,000 unsold but complete luxury new builds, with many still entering the market. Property analyst Molior London noted that sales of new homes in London fell by a fifth last year, and that the number\u0026nbspof unsold apartments continues to grow. And the more expensive they are, the more likely they are to be unoccupied: 39 per cent\u0026nbspfor homes worth £1m to £5m, 64 per cent\u0026nbspfor those places over £5m. There are reports of people trying hard to sell and to complicate matters, there’s the impending known-unknown that is Brexit.It seems an odd characteristic of the past 10\u0026nbspyears that things have been so difficult for buyers in one direction and so easy in the other. These luxury apartments are commonly between £1,000-£1,500 per sq ft, against the average UK price of £211 per sq ft. But, their posh locations aside, one of their key drivers has been the post credit-crunch migration of capital.“We’ve seen an\u0026nbspera of low interest and cash into assets,” says Henry Pryor, a property-buying agent. “When money is unsafe, or doesn’t inflate, the rich put it into other things: cars, art, houses.”The high-water mark was about six or seven years ago when then mayor Boris Johnson went on a spending spree and encouraged others to do likewise. London became what Pryor calls a “speculation paradise” – and that spike is now heading in the opposite direction.So, if housing is a free market that can go up as well as down, why does Almacantar not take the hit with its Centre Point flats and sell them for less? “It doesn’t work like that,” says Michael Ball of the Waterloo Community Development Group and a seasoned housing activist. “The problem is that housing is an extraordinary failure of the market. It’s an oligopoly that controls the supply.”Battersea\u0026nbspPower Station sat empty for\u0026nbspyears but is now being developed as a retail\u0026nbspand residential space (AFPGetty)The seeds of the current zombie-tower wobbles came with George Osborne’s stamp duty reforms in 2014, which took the froth off the market, leading to developer grumbles – wasn’t he one of us, they wailed? Then the long lead-time of developments began to show as a significant constraint, for as well as “skyscraper syndrome”\u0026nbsp(where a glut of tall building supposedly presages a downturn) there’s also the problem that many developments are financed by upfront sales.“Many were designed to be sold off-plan to release capital for building,” says Roarie Scarisbrick of Property Vision. “Now people are waiting until properties are actually built, which squeezes developers badly.” Increased scrutiny on money laundering may also play a part which, as Pryor says, “is still too easy”.Plus, some high-end properties were simply never meant to be\u0026nbsplived in but just to be “gold bars in the sky” as Ball puts it. It’s hard to find out how many of London’s luxury flats are truly unoccupied. “You can look at census, but it’s tough to find out numbers,” says Ball. “I don’t think we know the extent of it. The records are really poor.” And as ever with property, the winners crow and the losers remain silent.There are a few other factors to observe, including the move of real estate into a high-end branded fashion buy, as the Candy Brothers did with their developments. “That aspect took me by surprise,” says Pryor. “It turned out that people wanted to be able to specify that they had a Candy apartment as they sat in Monaco, as if boasting about owning a Bulgari watch or a Montblanc pen.”There’s also an argument that some parts of London, such as Eaton Square in Belgravia, have long acted as pieds-à-terre for the rich and were probably ghost-like in the 18th and 19th centuries. “Remember, in Downton Abbey they occasionally come down to ‘Grantham House’ in London,” says Adam Challis, head of residential research at real estate company JLL.“That old ‘country seat and the London house’ combination is now a global rather than national phenomenon, and a London apartment became part of a wider property portfolio.” He points out that while these spectral apartments may appear unoccupied, it could well be that their ultra-rich owners may only use them for six to eight weeks a year.I sometimes wonder what would happen if all the owners turned up at once to these places.\u0026nbspIt would be a disasterNine Elms is a typical new London “owned and left empty”\u0026nbspzone. A swathe of land between Battersea and Vauxhall, it was a low-value industrial hinterland dominated by the Cold Store –\u0026nbspa piece of charismatic dereliction used in an episode of The Sweeney – and the only respite being London’s flower market. Now it’s a parade of gleaming hi-tech towers.“When private developers get hold of the land it leaps in value tenfold,” says Michael Ball. So in a way, however many apartments have been sold here, it may have already fulfilled its profit promise. Sometimes, adds Scarisbrick, such places are not even designed for full occupancy. “I sometimes wonder what would happen if all the owners turned up at once to these places,” he says. “It would be a disaster.”US politicians question Trump\u0027s ties to scandal-struck Panama projectHow drones are revolutionising construction and real estateThere are precedents to all this. In earlier eras luxury housing went up as well as down, and lost out to new tastes. Michael Ball says that St Georges Buildings\u0026nbspin the Elephant and Castle area was built as a luxury development in the 1880s. “By the post-war era it had become squatted, then became social housing. Now it’s luxury housing again.”The ghost tower phenomenon isn’t confined to London or the UK. There are similar qualms in South Africa, Canada, New York and Mumbai, where a string of luxury skyscrapers in the Worli and Prabhadevi districts have recently struggled to find buyers. Emptiness is a fact of life in the construction industry and just last month it was reported that a fifth of China’s new housing is empty: an extraordinary total of 50 million ghost homes. But another aspect of construction, says Challis, is that it attracts “huge economic growth. So empty homes are an endemic feature of the world’s most important cities.”The extent of London’s ghost towers may even have been overestimated. “Evidence from the LSE for Sadiq Khan showed that unlived-in apartments were actually under 1 per cent\u0026nbspof new build properties,” says Peter Murray of NLA, who adds that London properties are still selling well in Singapore and Hong Kong. Meanwhile, London has 510 tall buildings in the pipeline: up from 455 in 2016. Even with its current depredations, property in London is still considered a safer bet than many financial vehicles.But there’s no doubt that ghost towers fail the political and social smell test: as visible reminders of disposable wealth in a city where most can’t get a foothold.So, given that ghost towers and unsold luxury flats currently exist, whither their luxurious wenge-floored acres, gyms, pools and media rooms? Will developers have fire sales just to get rid of them? (Molior London has said that 10-15 per cent\u0026nbspreductions are typical and 20-30 per cent\u0026nbspreductions achievable, and that it would take more than\u0026nbspthree years to sell the glut of ultra-luxury flats at the current rate).Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The US president\u0027s backing is seen as key for the Middle Eastern kingdom as it seeks to avoid sanctions over the murder of journalist Jamal Khassoggi.Jack Allardyce, oil and gas research analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe said there was no obvious catalyst for the recent slump.“It seems to have been driven by a wider impending sense of doom amidst weak equities, geopolitics, subsequent softening demand and increasing supply,” he said.\u0026nbsp“A lot depends on both the result of US-Sino talks at the G20 this week, and Opec and it’s allies’ meeting on the 6th – it looks as though the market has already decided that the mooted 1.4 million barrels of oil per day cut to output isn’t enough to offset the decline in demand growth projections, so if that is the number then the current level could remain into the new year (or we might see some more weakness).\u0026nbsp“If they opt to make deeper cuts – which seems unlikely given how much the US is leaning on the Saudi’s and Russia’s apparent lack of enthusiasm – then some sort of recovery is likely. As ever, benchmarks seem to move more dramatically than they really should given underlying fundamentals.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Following an investigation, the Competition and Markets Authority\u0026nbsp(CMA)\u0026nbspsaid\u0026nbspit had found that PayPal “could face insufficient competition in the UK after acquiring its market-leading rival”. The CMA also said its findings “raise\u0026nbspconcerns that the merger could result in customers, which include small and medium-sized businesses, paying higher prices or receiving a lower-quality service”.Google’s various payment services streamlined into one platformTommy Robinson banned from PayPalDid Paypal founder buy his New Zealand home as ‘apocalypse insurance’?PayPal completed its acquisition of the Swedish company in September, and the CMA began its probe of the deal in October.If PayPal and iZettle cannot address the regulator’s concerns, the merger will be referred for an indepth investigation. Andrea Gomes da Silva, CMA\u0026nbspexecutive director, said: “Payment services markets are evolving, so it’s particularly important to look to the future when we assess competition and the effects of mergers on customers.“While iZettle is a relatively recent entrant to payment services, it has already established a market-leading position in mobile point-of-sale devices and was well placed to compete against PayPal in other emerging markets. “That’s why we are concerned that PayPal’s takeover could lead to higher prices or reduce the quality of the services available to customers.”A PayPal spokesperson said, “PayPal continues to work cooperatively with the CMA as it conducts its review of the acquisition of iZettle. We are now working to address the CMA’s concerns and demonstrate to the CMA that the market will remain competitive, so we can move forward with integrating iZettle into our global platform.”Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: “The fees that small firms incur when processing card payments can cause a real drag on profits and lead to higher prices for customers – \u0026nbspparticularly as businesses are no longer allowed to charge for card use. This is especially the case for firms that handle a lot of low value transactions: coffee shops, barbers, convenience stores.“The CMA is absolutely right to scrutinise this potential acquisition on behalf of smaller businesses. It’s vital that – if completed – the merger doesn’t lead to even higher prices for card processing services or stifle much-needed innovation.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It will offer an unprecedented insight into the activity beneath that dusty surface.Latest as Nasa arrives on MarsEven as the craft makes its way to the ground, engineers will be using their intense practising to ensure that InSight\u0026nbsplands so that its sensors can be used. It will be directed so that even if it lands on a rock, or on its side, it will still be able to stick its sensors into the planet and examine it.Engineers will then decide where they are going to aim those sensors. They will then spend several weeks calibrating them and getting them into place, before they start taking scientific readings.Once they\u0027re in, they will start taking what Nasa refers to the as the planet\u0027s pulse. It will do so using a\u0026nbspseismometer that picks up waves as they move through the interior of the planet, helping understand how active Mars is and what makes it that way.As well as taking the pulse, it will collect other vital signs: it will measure the planet\u0027s temperature. Using a heat flow probe, it will look at how hot Mars\u0027s insides are, allowing us to understand how similar it is to Earth and help explore how both planets came to be.And it will also watch the way the planet moves, tracking its slight wobble on its axis. Using very precise radio antennas, they will watch that movement, helping understand how it is affected by the sun.So far, we have studied Mars from afar and on the ground, with telescopes, satellites and landers. By sticking sensors underneath and inside of Mars, Nasa hopes to get an insight into a planet that could one day soon become home to people.“We’ve studied Mars from orbit and from the surface since 1965, learning about its weather, atmosphere, geology and surface chemistry,” said Lori Glaze, acting director of the Planetary Science Division in NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. “Now we finally will explore inside Mars and deepen our understanding of our terrestrial neighbour as NASA prepares to send human explorers deeper into the solar system.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It went from more than 12,000mph\u0026nbspto a gentle landing in just under seven minutes.It landed in what appeared to be perfect form in the middle of a vast, barren area called the Elusium Planitia, near to other Nasa rovers. Initial data and photographs sent back from the surface suggested that it had landed flat and unimpeded by rocks or other problems.Nasa engineers at mission control in California’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory broke out into cheers and applause as two satellites that had been following InSight\u0026nbspreported that the lander had touched down without incident.“This is what we really hoped and imagined in our mind’s eye,” said Mr Manning. “Sometimes things work out in your\u0026nbspfavour.”It is the first time that Nasa has landed on Mars since the Curiosity rover arrived in 2012.The tricky journey onto Mars was watched over by two tiny satellites that travelled up on the same rocket and detached as they came closer to Mars. Those briefcase-sized spacecraft took messages from the InSight lander and sent them back to Earth, meaning that engineers could see everything happen almost\u0026nbspin real time.As soon as it had arrived,\u0026nbspInSight\u0026nbspsent back a photograph taken with a camera mounted on the front of the lander. Once it has recovered from its difficult journey, InSight will get to delving deep into the Martian surface for the first time ever.\u0026nbspNasa’s InSight lander after it touched down on the surface of Mars (HO  NASA TV  AFP)The lander will drill down under the ground and attempt to take Mars’s vital signs. It will look for heat signals, to understand the temperature deep in the interior of the red planet it will watch for vibrations, helping to understand how that core might be composed and it will watch for how it is tilting, and to understand how that happens.It will do so using a range of different equipment,\u0026nbspincluding a seismometer and drill that will dig beneath the surface in a way never attempted before. The kit has been made by a team comprising engineers from across the globe, with Germany in charge of the “mole” that will dig down into Mars’s interior, for instance, and France looking after the sensor itself.With all of the new scientific data, scientists hope they can learn more about how the Martian atmosphere formed, and what it might be made up of on the inside. In turn, that should help shed light on the other rocky planets in our solar system – including our own\u0026nbspEarth.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Using a variety of instruments, it will delve into the inside of the Mars surface, burying underneath.Elon Musk renames ‘BFR’ rocket to ‘Starship’As it does, it will send back information about what the planet looks like underneath that famous, dusty red surface. Scientists hope to learn about not only Mars itself but also about other rocky planets in our own solar system – including Earth.The rover will land on the surface this evening, UK time. Nasa will livestream the proceedings, and they will be covered as they happen here on\u0026nbspThe Independent.That descent is not guaranteed, and comes amid concern and upset about the future of the Opportunity rover. There have been numerous failed missions to Mars: from the European Space Agency’s\u0026nbspSchiaparelli\u0026nbsplander, which smashed into the surface in 2016 at such speed it could not have survived, all the way back to the original Soviet missions in the 1970s which repeatedly failed.This time around, we’ll get to know if it’s successful straight away. That’s thanks to two little flying robots known as CubeSats – named WALL-E and EVE after the main characters in the 2008 animated film – which went to Mars on the same rocket that is carrying the new lander and will fly past the Red Planet, relaying messages about its progress to\u0026nbspground controllers nearly 100 million miles away.Once the lander arrives on Mars, it will sit stationary and begin its work, looking deep underneath the surface for clues about what is going on there. Using seismometers to measure the movement of the ground, and a heat probe to take its temperature, scientists will get their first look at what is happening deep in Mars – and hopefully provide some clues about how it formed and more.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Slowed by friction, deployment of a giant parachute and retro rockets, InSight will descend 77 miles through pink Martian skies to the surface in 6 12 minutes, traveling a mere 5 mph (8 kph) by the time it lands.The stationary probe, launched in May from California, will then pause for 16 minutes for the dust to settle, literally, around its landing site, before disc-shaped solar panels are unfurled like wings to provide power to the spacecraft.Latest as Nasa arrives on MarsThe mission control team at NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) near Los Angeles hopes to receive real-time confirmation of the craft\u0027s arrival from data relayed by a pair of miniature satellites that were launched along with InSight and will be flying past Mars.The JPL controllers also expect to receive a photograph of the probe\u0027s new surroundings on the flat, smooth Martian plain close to the planet\u0027s equator called the Elysium Planitia.The site is roughly 373 miles (600 km) from the 2012 landing spot of the car-sized Mars rover Curiosity, the last spacecraft sent to the Red Planet by NASA.The smaller, 880-pound (360 kg) InSight - its name is short for Interior Exploration Using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport - marks the 21st U.S.-launched Mars missions, dating back to the Mariner fly-bys of the 1960s. Nearly two dozen other Mars missions have been sent from other nations.InSight will spend 24 months - about one Martian year - using seismic monitoring and underground temperature readings to unlock mysteries about how Mars formed and, by extension, the origins of the Earth and other rocky planets of the inner solar system.While Earth\u0027s tectonics and other forces have erased most evidence of its early history, much of Mars - about one-third the size of Earth - is believed to have remained largely static, creating a geologic time machine for scientists.InSight\u0027s primary instrument is a French-built seismometer, designed to record the slightest vibrations from marsquakes and meteor impacts around the planet. The device, to be placed on the surface by the lander\u0027s robot arm, is so sensitive it can measure a seismic wave just one half the radius of a hydrogen atom.Scientists expect to see a dozen to 100 marsquakes during the mission, producing data to help them deduce the depth, density and composition of the planet\u0027s core, the rocky mantle surrounding it, and the outermost layer, the crust.The NASA Viking probes of the mid-1970s were equipped with seismometers, too, but they were bolted to the top of the landers, a design that proved largely ineffective.Apollo missions to the moon brought seismometers to the lunar surface as well. But InSight is expected to yield the first meaningful data on planetary seismic tremors beyond Earth.InSight also is fitted with a German-made drill to burrow as much as 16 feet (5 meters) underground, pulling behind it a rope-like thermal probe to measure heat flowing from inside the planet.Meanwhile, a radio transmitter will send back signals tracking Mars\u0027 subtle rotational wobble to reveal the size of the planet\u0027s core and possibly whether it remains molten.NASA officials say it will take two to three months for the main instruments to be deployed and put into operation.Additional reporting by ReutersShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That was insensitive and ignorant. A deeply felt apology to all.”In the original post, the Aladdin writer was comparing using the word to using the phrase “anti-vax”.He wrote the message in reply to Julie Benson, a writer on TV series The 100, who was calling for her users to contribute to vaccination efforts.Johnny Depp ‘dropped’ from Pirates of the CaribbeanHe replied: “My heart goes out to all the parents of vaccine damaged children, who have to not only endure the sadness of their loss, but also the vitriol of ill-informed and insensitive people (such as those here). Anti-Vax is equivalent to calling someone a n****r and makes as little sense.” \u0026nbspAfter Benson replied asking Rossio to “...please never come on my feed with the N-word again,” Rossio replied: “Do you realise that you are using the equivalent of the ‘N-word’ in promoting memes that tag people as ‘anti-vax?’ Do you realize that the same collectivist stereotyping lies behind belittling any group with a label? Do you have no feelings for vaccine damaged kids and parents?“Twitter users immediately criticised Rossio for using the word, and said the comparison he made was shameful.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Ukrainian activists burn flares during their rally in front of the Russian Consulate in Kharkiv, Ukraine.

The scale of impact that we have estimated will make it harder to achieve key public policy objectives.“Difficult choices, particularly about taxation and spending, will have to be made. And there is little if any sign that the starkness of these choices has yet been appreciated, not least by the two main political parties, both of whose manifestos for the 2017 seemed to imply that a post-Brexit world would be one of business as usual.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Artist Joseph Hillier and his sculpture - Messenger, depicting a young powerful woman, which will be unveiled next year for Theatre Royal Plymouth.

The Brexiteers may lose their Brexit.”Ms Rudd also cast doubt on Ms May’s plans to seal the Brexit deal at a summit with EU leaders on Sunday, acknowledging there are still obstacles in the way.“Hopefully it will get through this week,” she said, adding: “There is still a negotiation going on in terms of actually getting this agreement through.”The comments make Ms Rudd the first cabinet minister to rule out a no-deal Brexit – and the first to suggest an agreement at European level could yet be derailed.They came as the prime minister prepared to head to Brussels for talks with Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, under huge pressure for further “wins” in the final text.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

The only deal possible.”\u0026nbspHe added: “Those who think that by rejecting the deal that they would have a better deal will be disappointed in the first seconds after the rejection of this deal.”Outside the summit, pro-Remain activists took a blowtorch to a mock copy of the withdrawal agreement, before they were asked to stop by Belgian police.EU president Juncker says he would vote in favour of May’s Brexit dealEU leaders agree to back Theresa May’s Brexit dealTop ministers ‘plotting different Brexit’ if deal fails in CommonsTheresa May writes ‘letter to nation’ insisting Brexit agreement worksHigh Court to rule if Brexit vote ‘void’ amid Banks investigationSpeaking on the doorstep of the meeting, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said he did not expect MPs to reject the deal.“I don’t expect a ‘no’ vote. I expect a ‘yes’ vote and this is the deal on the table. I don’t think there’s anything more,” he said.Discussion about what to do in the event the deal was rejected was notable by its absence from the meeting, with one senior EU official saying there was “no appetite” for it after the gruelling slog to an agreement.“I don’t think there were any ‘what if’ questions asked to Theresa May today, quite a few were wishing her good luck,” they said.We don’t want to create the false impression for the UK that a better alternative deal is possibleIrish prime minister Leo Varadkar said: “We made the conscious decision as 27 not to speculate\u0026nbspon alternative scenarios.“We don’t want to create the false impression for the UK that a better alternative deal is possible.”Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz added: “It is important that everyone in the UK is aware of the fact that this agreement is the final result. It will definitely not be renegotiated and there will be no further leeway.”The European Council conclusions released after the meeting specifically thanked chief negotiator Michel Barnier “for his tireless efforts as the Union’s chief negotiator and for his contribution to maintaining the unity among EU27 member states throughout the negotiations”.\u0026nbspEU leaders met among\u0026nbspthemselves without Theresa May, and were then joined by the British prime minister to discuss the deal once they had signed it off.

Spain wants any future relationship governing the British overseas territory to be negotiated bilaterally between itself and the UK.Behind the scenes, officials in Brussels were delighted with the result, particularly the maintenance of EU unity in the face of British attempts to ide the bloc.“Many member states have had very particular concerns which are all legitimate, and there has been a willingness to accommodate,” one EU source said.“More fundamentally that says something about the nature of the union. The union stands up for its member states – like Spain, Ireland. This is the essence of the union. I would tend to borrow a slogan and say ‘Stronger In’.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Without sufficient safeguards we could see British farmers significantly undermined while turning a blind eye to environmental degradation and poor animal welfare standards abroad,” said Mr Parish.“Our suggested amendment calls for agricultural goods to be imported into the UK only if the standards to which those goods were produced are as high as, or higher than, current UK standards.”He also noted that given the lack of clarity in the existing bill, future environment secretaries would be able to avoid scrutiny and make crucial decisions unchallenged.\u0026nbsp“We would like to see sufficient opportunities for parliamentary scrutiny before any new systems or policies are rolled out,” said Mr Parish.Environmental groups have long warned about environmental standards being compromised when the UK no longer abides by EU regulations, despite Mr Gove’s promise of a “green Brexit”.“Pressure to get a deal at any cost could mean our environmental standards are traded away for access to markets,” said Kierra Box, Brexit lead for Friends of the Earth.“This could result in the obvious lowering of standards.”Responding to the report, a spokesperson from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “Ministers have always been absolutely clear that we will not water down our high standards in pursuit of trade deals.\u0026nbsp“Our food security is built on a strong domestic production base and access to safe, high-quality imports from a erse range of countries.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

is it Norway, plus the single market, the customs union, which some of us have been arguing for for over two years?Mrs May responds: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom tempted to say to her that throughout the last 18 months of these negotiations at virtually every stage people have said to me it wasn\u0027t possible for me to negotiate a deal with the EU.\u0026ldquoNo sooner do I then people are saying \u0027well what\u0027s the next thing you\u0027re going to negotiate\u0027.4.10pm update: Corbyn claims continuing with deal is an act of national self harmThe Labour leader warns under the current deal, the UK would have to agree to demands on waters and quota shares to get a future trade deal or extend the transition period.\u0026nbspHe also claims the deal opened the door for Spain to have a role over Gibraltar.\u0026nbspThe Labour leader says:\u0026nbspIt\u0027s not in the national interest for the Prime Minister to plough on when it\u0027s clear this deal does not have the support of either side of this House or the country as a whole.Ploughing on is not stoic, it\u0027s an act of national self harm, instead of threatening this House with a no deal scenario of a no Brexit scenario the Prime Minister now needs to prepare a plan B.Theresa May responds saying the British people wanted control of our borders, they want an end to free movement and this deal delivers it.\u0026nbspReferencing Mr Corbyn\u0027s warnings over fishing and Gibraltar, she says: It\u0027s important to recall that if we were in the backstop we would be outside the Common Fisheries Policy and we would be deciding who has access to fish in our waters.He mentioned Gibraltar, I quoted the chief minister of Gibraltar who made very clear, as I did, that this Government stood by Gibraltar and we resisted changes to the Withdrawal Agreement which the Spanish government wished to make.4pm update: Corbyn goes on the attack against May\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn is quick to again attack Theresa May\u0027s agreed draft Breixt deal and the negotiations that led to it.\u0026nbspHe claims it fails to deliver on the Prime Minister\u0027s vow that it takes back control of the UK\u0027s borders, money and laws.\u0026nbspThe Labour leader says: The Prime Minister might want to sell yesterdays summit as a great success, but nothing has changed.The Prime Minister says if we reject this deal it takes us back to square one but the truth is under this government we have never got beyond square one.This botched deal is a bad deal for this country.Yesterday marked the end of miserable negotiations from the government.Even the Prime Minister\u0027s own government can\u0026rsquot bring themselves to sell this deal.Her Cabinet knows these negotiations have failed and will leave Britain worse off.The Prime Minister claims this deal takes back control of money and laws is a fallacy -

And does so in a way that also protects jobs, that also gives security to EU citizens.1.37pm update: Hard border on the island of Ireland cannot be avoided through goodwill and wishful thinking - Ireland\u0027s premierLeo Varadkar said the current draft Brexit deal on the table is the only way of preventing a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.The Taosieach said the heads of the 27 EU member states agreed not to speculate on a no-deal scenario, but he added that Ireland and the EU is making preparations for it.Speaking at a Project Ireland event in Dublin after returning from Brussels where the EU and the UK Government backed the draft withdrawal text, Mr Vardakar said it makes sense for everyone to agree to the current deal.He said: We need to be realistic here, there is no country in the EU that can be fully prepared for a cliff-edge, no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspTheir (British Parliament) decision on whether or not to accept the deal that had been negotiated by their government is a matter for their Parliament, so we don\u0027t want to be counter-productive by being seen to interfere with the of decisions of the British Parliament.You could imagine the reaction that might happen in Ireland if you had politicians from Spain or Britain or Denmark coming to Ireland and telling us how we should vote in a parliamentary vote.1.01pm update: Boris Johnson proposes NEW Brexit dealThe former foreign secretary and leading personality of the Leave campaign branded Mrs May\u0026rsquos deal a \u0026ldquodisaster for this country.Arguing it will keep Britain linked to the European Union for years to come, Mr Johnson said the best possible alternative to this agreement is to \u0026ldquobank what is sensible in it and chuck the rest.He wrote in the Daily : \u0026ldquoThe way out of this mess is clear.

With their first child due in early spring and most likely more to follow, Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have been looking for a bigger nest to start a family and it appears that the Queen has come up with the perfect solution.They will move from Kensington Palace in London to Frogmore Cottage near Windsor.Windsor is a very special place for Their Royal Highnesses and they are grateful that their official residence will be on the estate, confirmed a spokesman for the couple, adding, however, that the Duke and Duchess\u0027s main office will continue to be based 20 miles away at Kensington Palace.This will mark a considerable step up on the property ladder for the couple \u0026ndash from the two bedroom Nottingham Cottage (where Harry is reported to have proposed to his then-actress girlfriend in the kitchen over a roast chicken dinner) to a Grade II-listed house on the Windsor Estate, where the couple married in May.                Royal SPLIT: Why are Meghan and Harry parting ways with Will and Kate?On the face of it the move seems sensible, given that Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland has moved to Britain and intends to be a hands-on granny \u0026ndash never mind the maternity nurse, nanny, live-in housekeeper, security and other assorted flunkies who may require on-site housing.Frogmore Cottage \u0026ndash something of a misnomer really \u0026ndash is thought to have up to 10 potential bedrooms, although at present the house is sub-ided to accommodate staff working for the Crown Estate.Like many couples, the race will be on to have the place shipshape by the time the baby arrives \u0026ndash or is it twins, as the bookies seem to think? But unlike most other couples much of the hefty cost of revamping the white-painted property will be borne by we the taxpayers, though Harry and Meghan will be responsible for any interior decorating bills.News of the move does, however, follow reports that William and Harry are keen to put more space between them and will soon be setting up separate courts.Although the brothers remain close, living within a stone\u0027s throw of each other cannot always be easy. And Kensington Palace has become something of a royal ghetto, with the Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, the Duke of Kent and Duke and Duchess of Gloucester all in the \u0027hood.A more incendiary reason for the move stems from rumours that Meghan and Kate have an increasingly strained and tricky relationship.\u0026lsquoDemanding and difficult\u0026rsquo Meghan Markle and Harry to move away from Kate and WilliamFrogmore where Harry and Meghan Markle will make their home (Image: nc)Meghan Markle does not always see eye to eye with Kate Middleton (Image: Getty)Now we must put ision aside for a better future - EXPRESS COMMENTWorld War 2 veteran\u0027s campaign to stop Brexit thrown out by EU courtAs one royal expert put it: Whereas in the old days Diana and Fergie got on famously, there is little common ground between Meghan and Kate. Both are fiercely protective of their husbands and their relationship is polite rather than close.Kate went to boarding schools in the UK and met her husband at university \u0026ndash therefore sharing mutual friends. But Meghan comes from an entirely different milieu with a background that is still shrouded in a certain amount of mystery.No one is suggesting that Meghan and Kate have fallen out but, equally, there are no signs that they spend much time in each other\u0027s company beyond official family gatherings. Indeed, the atmosphere between the Queen and Meghan seems warmer than the one between the Duchess of Cambridge and Duchess of Sussex. What\u0027s without doubt is that Kate has raised her game since the glamorous arrival on the royal scene of Meghan, the Hollywood star and UN ambassador with a track record of championing women\u0027s rights. She has gone out of her way to appear more regal, more composed and less gushing than her Californian sister-in-law.This is also reflected in her wardrobe. Not so long ago, Kate was happy to be seen in \u0026pound39.99 dresses from Zara now it\u0027s Alexander McQueen, Emilia Wickstead, Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana and Catherine Walker all the way.And it should not be forgotten that Kate has always been ambitious, a trait she inherited from her thrusting mother.

However, there seem to be numerous pieces of evidence which suggest it is very possible. Many researchers agree that in the distant past, electricity was widely utilised in the land of the Pharaohs, with the Baghdad Battery being one of the most discussed examples of such advanced technology.

High tech vehicle symbols discovered                Egypt pyramid SHOCK: Extraordinary clue revealed by wisdom keeperIn 2009 Netflix documentary \u0026ldquoThe Pyramid Code, scientists discuss whether the battery is evidence of the ancient Egyptians having electricity.The battery is a set of three artefacts found together: a ceramic pot, a tube of copper and a rod of iron.Although it was discovered in Khujut Rabu, Iraq, many believe it was originally designed in Egypt.It was hypothesised by some researchers that the object functioned as a galvanic cell, possibly used for electroplating, or some kind of electrotherapy.  (Image: Getty)The narrator then explains that people were aware of the chemical source of current (CSC) in ancient times before claiming that electricity was generated and widely used.A careful examination of Egyptian history immediately reveals the sophistication in perfect illumination.No soot has been found in the corridors of the pyramids or the tombs of the kings because these areas were lit using electricity, the documentary adds.Relief carvings could also show that the Egyptians used hand-held torches powered by cable-free sources.The arc lamp used in the Lighthouse of Alexandria is further evidence that electricity might have been used in ancient Egypt.Diagram illustrating the Baghdad battery  (Image: Google)The energy required to power the Lighthouse of Alexandria for 24 hours a day could only have been supplied by a regular electrical source.Moreover, experiments with models of the Baghdad Battery have produced between 3 and 5 volts.

but the EU has warned that would render the mechanism pointless.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.At the same time the UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.On November , thereported that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab demanded the right to pull Britain out of the EU’s Irish backstop after just three months.The paper claimed the hardline pitch to the Irish government “stunned” officials.Its claimed Mr Raab’s proposal was put to the Irelands deputy prime minister Simon Coveney in a private meeting in London.However, the Irish Prime Minister told Theresa May that he will not accept a Brexit deal which gives the UK the unilateral power to halt backstop arrangements for the border with Northern Ireland.The EU has suggested a backstop that would see Northern Ireland staying in the customs union, the EU VAT system and parts of the single market.This will essentially draw a customs border down the middle of the Irish Sea, potentially damaging the union of the UK.Mrs May has suggested a backstop that will see all of the UK aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after .Brussels has two issues with Mays plan.The first is that May wants the backstop to come to an end after a certain time period the EU thinks this would be self-defeating as its possible no solution for the Irish border would be found.The EU also thinks this risks leaving Britain benefiting from the customs union and single market for years after Brexit - reaping all the benefits without having any of the obligations that full membership would entail.In June  European leaders said Britain was running out of time to do a deal because of the unsolved border problem.In July Theresa May quoted Shakespeare as she insisted the UK would not be broken up with a border down the Irish Sea.Theresa May has told EU leaders she is looking at ways of keeping Britain under their rules for at least another year as part of efforts to break the Brexit deadlock.Addressing the  national bosses at a tense summit in Brussels on the night of October , the PM said she is “ready to consider” extending the  month transition period after the UK leaves the EU next March.The potentially incendiary move has been drawn up by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier to try to end a bitter impasse over the Irish border.It would mean abiding by all Brussels rules until December  at the earliest.The news comes after talks on Sunday, October , hit a brick wall once again, as the issue of the Irish border continues to cause a headache for Theresa May.Theresa May has insisted any backstop arrangement must apply to the UK as a whole so not to create a border in the Irish Sea.However, talks broke down after the EU had insisted on a second backstop arrangement - just involving Northern Ireland -the UKs version wasnt ready in time, according to Downing Street sources.Brussels admitted in a draft trade agreement that technology COULD be used to solve the thorny issue of the border, using Max Fac solutions at the frontier as part of a future deal between the UK and EU.But the backstop - which keeps Britain in the customs unionno alternative is agreed to keep the Irish border open - will stay in the withdrawal agreement as an insurance policy.Ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith said: The withdrawal agreement will make it very clear that should we struggle with a negotiation for a free trade arrangement and not complete that process, we will fall into the Northern Ireland backstop.I would hope that she would now consider that none of this is at all workable unless we get the withdrawal agreement now amended so that any arrangements we make strip out that backstop.Former minister Owen Paterson added: As long as the backstop is in existence in a legally binding document, there is a danger that should talks fail the backstop becomes accepted.We would have the horror of falling into a customs union, the horror of having Northern Ireland separated from the rest of the United Kingdom.Mrs May dubbed the continuing row with Brussels over how to avoid a hard border in Ireland as “the one real sticking point left, but a considerable one”.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.On November , , the PM faced crunch Cabinet showdowns with her ministers where she will set out the details of the agreement she struck with Brussels the previous day.A number of pro-Brexit ministers are feared to be on the brink of walking out over the deal.They believe it would leave Britain tied to the EU customs union for years to come, because of the controversial Irish backstop arrangement.If the Cabinet does block Mrs Mays deal, she could find her position is untenable - leading to a Tory leadership crisis."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000451264672.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tories must concentrate dismantling jeremy corbyn","story":"Homes are unaffordable, rents too, trains unreliable, police are depleted and in disarray with crime soaring, huge corporations dodge tax yet pay some undeserving executives obscene sums.Our schools, NHS and social care are struggling.

Securing a general election is the only thing that matters to them.Jeremy Corbyn is showing scant regard for statesmanship and putting our country’s best interests a poor second to sheer tribal and selfish ambition.I will tell you one thing about Theresa May: No one can say she is putting herself through this for personal political ambition.Hers has been a tormented week of continued public duty and personal, selfless service.Stoic and steadfast, the Prime Minister has shown a resilience seen rarely in politics, probably last admired when another woman ran the country.The stance of Arlene Foster’s DUP is carelessly irresponsible in the extreme.A lot of the “backstop” stuff and the — unacceptable in my view — possibility of the EU being able to block our exit, has been caused by a bona fide effort from May to accommodate the DUP’s wishes.For me, it has been an interesting week in another way as well.I have presided over the board meetings of several of the six private companies I have the honour to chair.Dferent sizes, dferent sectors, dferent parts of the country, yet they are all saying the same things. That business is doing fine. Not what the doomsayers want to hear, but true. It is hard work but certainly not Armageddon.Companies up and down the land are demanding a diet of “boring, stable predictability”. It means they can invest more cash and employ more people. It is uncertainty that kills us.I am hearing from boardrooms that the Brexit proposal is fine, with one big caveat.On the plus side, a Single Market for manufactured goods will work.Anyone selling into the EU — yes, even China and Trump’s USA — has to abide by EU regulation.“Taking it” from Berlin, er, Brussels in this area is not a problem whatever ideologues may say. It secures hundreds of thousands of jobs and tax revenues.The proposed deal means business will be free to recruit essential immigrant labour on the basis of their skill and not where they come from.Choosing from a global, not just an EU, pool of talent is so, so helpful and will assist our international competitiveness hugely.But the one message ringing through my ears is, “Get on with it.”Regardless of whether a business is in Birmingham or Barcelona, Sunderland or Stuttgart, the wealth-creators of Europe, the payers of the tax that builds schools and hospitals, the job-providers just want their politicians to stop this rowing now.Stop the bullying, Berlin stop the rowing, Tories stop the naked, tribal, selfish manoeuvring, Labour — and just do it.One big caveat: You cannot expect anyone in our country — businesswoman or a guy on the line alike — to accept a deal that gives Jean-Claude Juncker’s lot the final say on when, indeed,we leave. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his team have bullied us enough.While there are a million dferent beliefs on what the majority of Brits voted for in the referendum, one thing is certain: They DID vote to leave.Giving the EU the final yes no on that is unacceptable and surely no deal is better than that.No deal means no £billion to the unelected, unaccountable Eurocrats. No deal means fewer jobs in troubled Germany and faltering France.Yes, it would be harder for UK business for sure. But not fatal. There would be a price to pay, but whoever said freedom does not come at a price There was one other thing businesses were clear on at my meetings last week.The quicker this country understands there is a greater threat to prosperity, jobs, tax revenues and a successful economy than Brexit, the better.A Corbyn government would turn this country into Venezuela in short order talent and capital would leave so quickly that John McDonnell would have nothing left punitively to tax.The message from small business is as clear as it is strong.The Conservatives, Liberals, big business and the establishment must stop obsessing about Brexit and focus on the greatest threat this country has faced for decades.And that is a bunch of extreme hard-Left business-haters who would ruin this great country and probably blame their abject failure on Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No-one wants to see ato the hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.Instead, the EU’s real game is to try to prise Northern Ireland away from Great Britain, aligning its laws with the EU – a direct threat to the integrity of the UK.Scenting weakness, the EU is now threatening to exclude Gibraltar from a future trade deal.We are being blackmailed and bullied into a flawed deal. The EU has used the negotiations to stle the opportunities and optimism that fired people up to vote Leave in .In truth, there are risks in any course of action we take now. But, by far the gravest is to succumb to the EU’s terms, stay tethered to Brussels, and accept a deal that prevents us from becoming masters of our own destiny.Over the long term, that would drain the strength of our economy, when Brexit should be a boost for workers and consumers. And those who voted Leave would feel cheated, shredding trust in our democracy.Of course, the EU were never going to welcome Brexit. Some sour grapes were inevitable. That’s why we worked hard to leave on positive terms, extending the arm of friendship.In , the EU has taken every concession and gesture of goodwill as a chance to try to bully and control us – at times treating our Prime Minister, and our country, with outright disdain.We need to be honest about the situation: there are risks in a No Deal scenario.But, they can be mitigated and managed by the government -it exercises grip and demonstrates political will. So, let us steel ourselves, and reject this miserly deal.We should make our best final offer to Brussels, then ready ourselves to leave the EU on  March - whatever their response.That way, we can deliver on the verdict of the people, and grasp the opportunities of Brexit.

her first since sealing the landmark orce agreement two days ago after  painstaking months of talks - to issue her own icy retaliation.The PM said: “I looked at the remarks that President Macron made.“I think what he needs to remember is thatwe enter into the backstop, then we will be outside of the Common Fisheries Policy and we will be deciding who has access to our waters.“So whose fishermen would be able to fish in UK waters ”Mrs May spoke to The Sun in her No study yesterday afternoon as she began a titanic two-week battle to win support for her controversial deal.With just two weeks to go until the all-important meaningful vote on it in the Commons, Mrs May also during the interviewHardline Brexiteers leaped on Mr Macron’s threats to attack Mrs May in the Commons yesterday.Grilling her, former Tory leader Iain Duncan-Smith even asked: “Isn’t Mr Macron right  We will come under intolerable pressure to agree almost anything ”But Mrs May’s named fishing rights as a major win for her in the  month-long Brexit orce deal negotiation.She insisted: “We negotiated very hard and we were able to resist some of the things that the European Union wanted, some very important issues.“We were very clear that we were going to be an independent coastal state, and that we were not going to see a linkage in these documents between access to waters and access to trade”.Mrs May is also desperate to win back the support of  DUP MPs.They have vowed to vote down her deal because the backstop plan to keep the Irish border open would see dferent rules and regulations enforced on Northern Ireland for a while.But offering up a fresh olive branch, the PM told The Sun she might voluntarily promise the rest of the UK would keep the exact same EU regulations as Northern Ireland would have to have for as long as any Irish backstop runs.Lting the lid on her latest thinking, Mrs May said: “What we are looking at is how can we give reassurance to the people of Northern Ireland.“There is this question about regulatory ergence between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.“What you don’t want is a situation where you go down one route, only then potentially when the future relationship comes into place to go down another route.“That doesn’t make sense for business at all.“So there is a practical sense where during that temporary period of time, I would think the UK would not be wanting to introduce regulatory ergence.”The PM also risks igniting a row today by downgrading the relevance of the Government’s own assessment of how her Brexit deal will affect the economy.The Treasury is publishing forecasts ahead of the meaningful vote - probably Wednesday - to compare the impact of her deal to no deal and staying in the EU.But Mrs May said last night: “The government is committed to providing analysis on the economic position, which we will do and provide that to Parliament.“All I would say is to anybody looking at these issues, they need to recognise that these things are always based on a set of assumptions.“They don’t always reflect every factor that can be taken into account.“It is very dficult to forecast the state of the economy in relation to this.”In a hint that the Government’s comparisons may reflect badly on her agreement, Mrs May added: “Why I am proposing this deal is because I believe it is important to deliver on the vote of the British people”.The PM also defended a controversial knighthood to long standing Tory Eurosceptic Sir John Hayes, which was announced three days ago.She hit back as claims it was a bung for his support, insisting “this has been misconstrued”.Revealing she had agreed the honour as far ago as January to soften his blow of being fired as a minister, Mrs May explained: “When John ceased to be a minister, I had a conversation with him and I recognised the signicant contribution that he had made over the years to the government”.Asked whether she will offer any gongs in exchange for votes in her battle to win over MPs, the PM just fixed The Sun with an icy stare and said: “I hope that when it comes to the vote Tom, all Members of Parliament will recognise the importance of delivering on Brexit”.With  of her own Tory MPs having already spoken out against her deal, Mrs May refused to deny she is now facing a Herculean task to win the showdown vote on the deal on December .She instead admitted: “I don’t doubt that it is up to me to make a really good case for this deal.“It delivers on what people voted for. And you heard what was being said in Europe yesterday about this being the only possible deal.“I think people need to focus on that.”The PM refused to share her Chief Whip’s daunting current calculations on whether it could ever be winnable, saying only that she has “constant discussions” with him and “you would not expect me to say anything ”.And Mrs May again refused to discuss whether she would resignshe loses the landmark vote.She added: “To me it is about doing what I believe right and in the national interest, not thinking, ‘Oh gosh what is somebody going to think about me’”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have no idea what concessions we’ll have to makethe EU tries to strong-arm us over the coming years.But even assuming we DO obtain full control of our borders, we must use those powers to build an immigration system that welcomes the world’s best, brightest and most ambitious.Because a good Brexit is one that delivers a reinvigorated global Britain.And that is what makes the PM’s deal so concerning. For all her warm words, we do not see HOW we can negotiate good trade deals with other countries, as the deal offers us limited ability to offer tarf reductions.That’s not an international Britain — the sort of free-trading Britain that is relaxed about our passports being made in France and seeing Japanese cars made in Sunderland.We must be able to embrace the world beyond our nearest neighbours.“It’s welcome news that the Government is starting to prioritise its negotiations, although we would like to see an agreed consultation or engagement mechanism for business put in place before these begin in earnest - as is the norm with trade policy in many other countries.”A spokesman for the Department for International Trade said: CPTPP is a huge trading bloc in the Asia-Pacic, accounting for close to £ in every £ of the global economy.Joining this partnership would bring the UK closer to key economies in one of the fastest growing regions the world.

I was really shell-shocked.”It seems like such a simple admission. But the reality is that with most celebrities, from the Kardashians to the Beckhams, projecting an unfeasibly perfect image of parenthood as part of their brand, many expectant mums think a new baby is going to be a walk in the park.The reality for most of us really couldn’t be further from the truth.Paloma also talked about the dficulty of balancing being a new mother with having a career.“I found it very dficult, the pull between wanting to be the greatest mother ever but also trying to sustain an inherently selfish career,” she said.The transition from being a woman with a career and all the time in the world to a mother wanting to continue working is no easy feat.There’s a period of adjustment and, often, the road is rocky. So here’s the reality, for what it’s worth.In my experience, EVERY woman who is a parent finds motherhood hard at some point or ­another, but especially at the beginning. And the women who seem to be sailing through it are often putting on a brave face, partly because they feel under pressure to do so.Often, people’s public portrayal of their le, including motherhood, is heavily edited, airbrushed and ­censored.The pressure on women for everything, including motherhood, to be “perfect” is clear.And,that isn’t your experience, with everyone  seemingly acing it, the pressure is on to pretend that it is.The vicious cycle is born. So it’s brave of Paloma to talk about her experience out loud.Given that every mum in the history of the universe has felt this way about motherhood at one time or another, we should be more honest about admitting it to be true.Modern pressures are making it so dficult I have to say I’m so glad I’m not raising a child today.The internet had still not been invented. The Twitter and Instagram inventors had probably not even been born.When I was growing up the only “influencers” in my le were my mum and dad.We ate as a family every night and there were three channels on the TV that all stopped airing by midnight. You had to make your own entertainment.Nowadays you can’t move for influencers on YouTube, Instagram and Twitter telling your kids how they should look or feel — and ­promoting lestyles that are simply unattainable.No wonder there has been such a dramatic rise in young people self-harming and taking anti- depressants. Too many influencers, who are hashtag “blessed”, don’t talk about the dficult stuff.Paloma, by the way, is raising her child as “gender neutral” — a ­decision that seems to be another indication of the pressures that ­people are under to do the right thing by their children.Too much choice and too much pressure to do the right thing and be the perfect parent can lead to paranoia.The best advice I could give a parent now that my own two are  and  is to find your own path.Don’t look too hard at what everyone  is doing.Don’t compare yourself to any other mothers, especially not celebrities with a team of personal trainers and chefs, and who snap back into shape two weeks after giving birth.Instead of aiming for perfect, just try to do your best.Listen, understand and give your child the one thing that really does matter: Self-esteem.Talk to other women, and be honest, evenyou are finding it hard. Because it IS bloody hard.So good for Paloma for being honest and fighting the tide of propaganda about motherhood.Because being honest makes it easier for other women who might be struggling.ISN’T it incredible to think that a hundred years ago, on November , , women were allowed to stand for parliament in the UK for the very first time Fast forward to the  General Election when  female MPs were elected.Yes, that’s in relation to  male MPs, so we still have a way to go – but look how far we have come.I know I am biased, but women are such a brilliant parliamentary asset.Look at all the things they bring to the table and to the conversation.Women are great listeners, good mediators, brilliant diplomats and inspiring promoters of family and equal rights. Oh, and we are resilient.Just look at Theresa May who, at a time when most men would be hiding under the duvet and emitting a high-pitched wailing noise, is rising to the unbelievable challenges being thrown at her by the Brexit process – and enjoying beans on toast with her husband Philip in the evening.Compare her to a politician such as Jacob Rees-Mogg who is doing everything he possibly can to promote himself and his political ambitions – rather than focusing on what the country needs.The PM is the living embodiment of resilience – a tough old bird indeed.ANYONE in a long-term marriage should take note of Dolly Parton’s insights on what makes her -year union work.“When people ask me what’s the key to my long marriage and lasting love, I always say, ‘Stay gone’,” the singer, reveals. “I travel a lot, but we really enjoy each other when we’re together and the little things we do.”Her husband Carl doesn’t like to appear in public or walk the red carpet – so she leaves him at home.Instead of glamorous date nights, they take trips in a “little camper”, go on picnics and eat at local restaurants, including a drive-thru McDonald’s.But eventhey are having a quiet night in, she says she always makes sure she is “fixed up for him because I don’t believe in going home and being a slouch”.You’ve got to love Dolly.NOT many people can ooze class, charm and elegance with their leg raised higher than their head – at the age of .Butthere’s one woman who can, it’s the glorious Darcey Bussell, who must be one of the nicest, and classiest, women in showbiz today.Goldman was one of the first corporate firms to introduce “lactation rooms” for women to express milk and it also runs free prenatal fitness classes at its office gym.It also has on-site day care where employees’ children are cared for  days per year for free.All of which is great – and let’s hope more companies follow suit for new parents.Mind you, it’s not like the need for childcare ever really stops – I still need an emergency nanny occasionally when my -year-old daughter loses her keys or my -year-old son locks himself out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But a No spokesman claimed the two were completely dferent - because one is a forecast and the other is analysis. The Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May and the EU covers two areas: the Withdrawal Agreement, covering the UKs exit from the EU, and the Political Declaration on a Future Framework, which sets out the relationship with the EU after Britain leaves. Key details on the Brexit deal include: . The Withdrawal AgreementThe transition period can be extended until  - after the next election Goods face being checked between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK A backstop could extend EU customs rules UK-wide - and wed need Brussels permission to quit European courts will still have a big hold on the UK.

The most infamous example is the Boris Johnson’s Brexit bus, claiming that leaving the EU would result in poundm a week for the NHS. Sir David Norgrove, the chair of the UK Statistics Authority, rightly chastised Johnson for his “clear misuse” of figures when the former Foreign Secretary repeated this patently absurd claim last year. This evening, I will present an award at the British Curry Awards, which used to be something of a Conservative haven. Today, as with last year, Tory Brexiteers won’t be able to show their faces without facing a barrage of criticism from the restaurateurs present.  One of the other  pledges in  was made by Priti Patel, who launched a ‘Save our curry houses’ campaign. She claimed that a Leave vote would mean more chefs and staff would be able to come over from Asia because of an end to freedom of movement from the EU. This is a particularly sensitive issue for the pound.bn curry industry. Figures y, but hundreds of Indian and Bangladeshi restaurants have shut down in recent years, with forecasts that % will go by . The main problem is not demand - the Spice Business magazine estimates that Brits will eat  million poppadoms this year. It is one of supply, with % of restaurants reporting an acute shortage of chefs and kitchen staff. This was the reason I backed the idea of a ‘vindaloo visa’ at last year’s awards. This would see strict one-year visas granted to Asian chefs, who would then train the next generation of curry cooks in what is incredibly sophisticated cuisine.  Theresa May was sent this -page proposal when she was Home Secretary, but has continued to ignore its merits. Patel’s campaign helped make sure that the majority of the curry industry voted for Brexit. But the promises have proved to be . Visas will remain incredibly dficult to obtain and the industry instead faces a problem hiring the front-of-house and assistant staff that they need - because these were roles so often filled by EU workers. Restaurateurs believe they have been betrayed and senior figures from the industry have told me that the majority would now vote remain. Theresa May’s lamentable ‘deal’ has done little to assuage their anger. The curry industry, like the rest of the nation, must be given the chance to vote on that deal, with the option of an exit from Brexit, now that it is clear they were so badly misled."},{"url":null,"title":"its premeditated cruelty hardest thing","story":"NewsopinionIt’s the premeditated cruelty that is the hardest thing to swallow about Universal CreditInstitution after institution warns of he dangers of UC, but the Tories just keep rolling it outShareByBrian Reade:,  NOV Newsopinion \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt’s the premeditated cruelty that is the hardest thing to swallow.

Theresa May is the new Kerry Katona. The most powerful person in the country, in the top job, has become the undisputed Queen of Schadenfreude. In a way, you could say that Mrs May is actually turning out to be a very inspiring leader. Every morning, however depressing and hard the day ahead of you might be, you can always make yourself feel better by reminding yourself that at least you’re not her. Her day will definitely be worse. Wherever she is, whatever she’s up to. Much, much worse. When you’re struggling to keep going, just think of her. If Theresa May can manage to even put one foot out of bed in the morning – never mind the other one, and then the rest of her – then there’s really no excuse for you not to. There’s also a good chance she’s making us nicer, as a nation, and more compassionate.  It’s a refreshing change to have a Prime Minister you feel sorry for, rather than actively despising, isn’t it  You’re not rooting for her, clearly... but you’re not quite fully rooting against her, either. She’s a Tory, – ie. inherently evil to the core with no redeeming features whatsoever – and yet rather than booing and hissing when you see her on the news, you can’t help but make the noise you wouldyou saw a puppy getting kicked. No, that’s not quite right actually... maybe more a snake getting stamped on. It’s not something you would want as a pet, but you still don’t like to see it being abused. The truth is, it is almost impossible not to desperately pity Theresa May at the moment. She worked hard to achieve an ambition, and then triumphantly succeeded, against all the odds... only for it to be an utterly miserable existence.  A poisoned chalice that doesn’t even have the decency to finish her off. The living embodiment of being careful what you wish for. Everyone hates everything she does. No-one is on her side, or in her corner. Her own party are the opposition just as much as the opposition. The criticism is relentless, and being fired from every angle. This poor, unfortunate woman, who is so into shoes, cannot put a foot right. But the most heartbreaking thing about Theresa May  She keeps going. Doggedly. She’s beaten down, broken. She’s aged over  years in the last three weeks alone, but she is determinedly keeping calm and carrying on. Her brave face never slips. She plods on regardless, grimacing as cheerfully as she can manage, teeth gritted, trying to make the best of what has turned out to be – understatement of the millennium – a bad job. There are worse role models. All this teaches us a valuable lesson. Whatever a person’s politics, or actions, may be, underneath they are still a human being, worthy of empathy, understanding and love. We need to remember that. It’s important. And then when Brexit goes through, and our country is ruined, we can get back to hating Theresa May, and her whole party again without exception, obviously. Bloody Tories – boo, hiss.

In a ‘letter to the nation’ on Saturday, the Prime Minister said she’d fight heart and soul” to turn her Brexit vision into a reality, insisting her deal is the best - and only - deal on the table for Britain. She said: When I became your prime minister, the United Kingdom had just voted to leave the European Union. From my first day in the job, I knew I had a clear mission before me - a duty to fulfil on your behalf: to honour the result of the referendum and secure a brighter future for our country by negotiating a good Brexit deal with the EU. “It will be a deal that is in our national interest - one that works for our whole country and all of our people - whether you voted ‘leave’ or ‘remain’.” When Donald Trump was asked about Mrs May’s plan in an interview yesterday he appeared to undermine the Prime Minister’s vision, saying it was a “great deal for the EU”. The President even went on to say that the proposed plan could jeopardise any potential future trading agreements between the UK and US.  Mr Trump said: I think we have to take a look at, seriously, whether or not the UK is allowed to trade. Because, you know, right now,you look at the deal, they may not be able to trade with us. And that wouldnt be a good thing. I dont think they meant that. I dont think that the Prime Minister meant that. And, hopefully, shell be able to do something about that. But, right now, as the deal stands she may not, they may not, be able to trade with the US. And, I dont think they want that at all. That would be a very big negative for the deal.

The research is the second report in two days to warn the PMs plan will see the economy lose out on tens of billions of pounds every year. Andtheres No Deal the hit to GDP could be .%, said the research by the London School of Economics Centre for Economic Performance, Kings College London and the Institute for Fiscal Studies. It comes after the Prime Minister dismissed research by suggesting Brexit forecasts are not facts. She told the House of Commons: I think it would be an interesting debate for this House - the extent to which economic forecasts can be described as facts. The Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May and the EU covers two areas: the Withdrawal Agreement, covering the UKs exit from the EU, and the Political Declaration on a Future Framework, which sets out the relationship with the EU after Britain leaves. Key details on the Brexit deal include: . The Withdrawal AgreementThe transition period can be extended until  - after the next election Goods face being checked between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK A backstop could extend EU customs rules UK-wide - and wed need Brussels permission to quit European courts will still have a big hold on the UK. The Future FrameworkComprehensive arrangements that will create a free trade area - not exactly the frictionless trade hoped for Possible EU access to British fishing waters We would remain tied to European courts Wed respect human rights laws Visas needed for long term trips to the EU It has built in vagueness - kicking the can down the road for further negotiationsRead about the deal in more depth here. The cost to the public finances would be up to .% of GDP under Mrs Mays deal or .% in a no-deal scenario, far outweighing any savings from reduced contributions to EU budgets, said todays report, released by the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank. Income per capita would fall by more than .% in the UK under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement and almost .% with no deal, the report found. Reduction in per-capita income would be comparable in Ireland to the UK, but for most EU countries the losses are estimated to be around  times lower. One of the authors of the report said the UK economy could be expected to be signicantly smaller than it would have been had Britain stayed in the EU, resulting in higher taxes or lower public spending over the medium to long term. The report analysed the likely impact of Mrs Mays Brexit deal or a no-deal withdrawal over the period to , compared to the baseline projection of how the UK economy would develop under continued EU membership. Early December: Theresa May tours UK with two-week campaign to sell her deal directly to the British public.  December: A vote in the House of Commons on the deal.  December: The last chance EU Council summit, where deal could come back for more negotiation.  December: Parliament rises for its Christmas break. Final or re-run vote by MPs must be held before now. If it fails there could be no deal, or a general election, or a second EU referendum.  March : Brexit Day. If theres a deal, this will be a total anticlimax because a transition will be in place. If theres No Deal, planes could be grounded, ports jammed up and customs checks thrown into chaos at pm.  December : If theres a deal, this is when the transition period - which continues pretty much all the EU rules we have now - is supposed to end. But it could be extended by two more years.  January : If theres still no deal, under current plans a backstop would kick in. This could keep the UK tied to EU customs rules, until a proper agreement is reached, in exchange for keeping the Northern Ireland border open. Read the full guide to the timetable here. The academic researchers did not factor in the expected impact of any short-term disruption to trade as a result of a possible clf-edge departure. The report estimated the cut in GDP after  years, compared to the remain scenario, at .%-.% under Mrs Mays deal and .%-.% in a no-deal outcome. The cost to the Treasury from reduced revenues such as taxes would be .%-.% of GDP under Mrs Mays deal and %-.% with no deal. Kings College Professor Jonathan Portes, a co-author of the report, said: The Brexit deal would leave us in a customs union with the EU for the indefinite future - but it is a long way from frictionless trade.  The additional trade barriers, combined with reductions in both skilled and unskilled migration from the ending of free movement, would leave the UK economy signicantly smaller than it would otherwise have been over the medium to long term. That in turn would mean higher taxes or lower public spending. Co-author Professor Anand Menon, director of The UK in a Changing Europe, said: Obviously, this kind of economic modelling needs to be treated with appropriate caution. However, our estimates provide a clear indication of the broad scale of the impact of the deal negotiated by the Prime Minister. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: This analysis confirms what everyone knows: that this deal will be bad for growth, incomes and the public finances. If the Prime Minister is unwilling or unable to deliver a Brexit deal that works for the whole country, she should stand aside, call a general election and let Labour deliver a deal that protects jobs and delivers for the whole country.

A new list of second-hand vehicles also shows their most common faults and when they become a problem for drivers across the UK. The findings are based on a number of key indicators, including the numbers of claims against faults and how much each car costs, report The Sun . A spokesman for Warranty Wise, who conducted the research, said: This data is derived from real cases and genuine warranty claims making it the most trustworthy information a used car buyer can get. “We are not suggesting, by any means, that these problems are guaranteed to occur, but it is the sole reason a warranty exists.” The most reliable brand is the Honda with a % reliability rating - while Seat is the least reliable with %. As can be seen in the following list, three Vauxhall models are deemed to be the most unreliable, while surprising entrants in the form of high end cars from Mercedes and Range Rover also are beset with issues. THE  MOST UNRELIABLE CARS . Renault Clio   The Clio is of the most common cars on UK roads - but it is still susceptible to big electrical faults and ignition coil problems. The most expensive common problem with the car is gearbox faults which on average cost pound to repair. . Fiat  The Fiat  is another very common car on UK roads, but is very prone to gearbox problems. The Italian car also suffers with problems arising from the suspension, electrical faults and also clutch faults.   Problems start to arise with car when it is close to eight years old. . Seat Ibiza The Spanish manufacturer is popular with motorists - but Warranty Wise say most common problem is with the engine and will cost motorists a huge pound.    Other common faults with the car include issues with the ignition coil, turbo faults and gearbox faults which all cost more than pound to repair. Normally problems start to pile up on Ibiza drivers when the car is nine years and three months old. . Mini Cooper The Mini Cooper is one of the UKs most iconic cars due to its association with the classic film The Italian Job - but they have a number of issues which do not come with mini repair costs. The most common problem with the Mini Cooper is a clutch fault which typically sets motorists back approximately pound.   But costly issues such gearbox or engine failures will set motorists back on average a whopping pound. To compound the woe, it normally takes just one-and-a-half years for the problems to pile up. . Mercedes-Benz C-class A Merc is an expensive car to buy, so unsurprisingly it isn’t a cheap car either to fix. The most common fault with the car is an electrical fault which costs on average pound to fix.   Other common problems include sensor faults, suspension faults, engine faults and problems with the alternator. But it does normally take close to a decade for the issues to surface. . Vauxhall Astra Despite being Vauxhalls second best selling model behind the Corsa in the UK - some of the most common faults will set you back a small fortune to repair. The most common warranty claim is for gearbox issues - which cost more than pound, to fix.   Another major problem with car is with engine faults normally costing around pound to repair - alongside electrical and clutch faults. It normally takes nine years and three months for problems to pile up. . Peugeot  French manufacturer Peugeot has a reputation for unreliability. The most common fault with the car includes engine problems, faults with cylinder head gasket, clutch faults, electrical faults and gearbox faults.   The priciest problem with Peugot is engine faults which on average cost owners pound. But it normally takes  years and two months for problems to pile up. . Vauxhall Insignia This is Vauxhall’s second entry to the list, a popular saloon car with families. Warranty Wise state the biggest problem with the vehicle comes down problems with the steering.   This usually costs around pound to repair but other common faults include engine faults and gearbox faults which typically cost more than pound, to fix. It normally takes seven years and seven months for problems to pile up. . Vauxhall Zafira Vauxhall makes yet another entry into the list - and the Zafira has been the subject of ious recalls due to fire fears that have been caused in the main by replacement parts. But the most common fault with the car is down to problems with the gearbox which on averages costs more than pound, to repair.   More common issues include clutch faults, problems with ignition coil, alternator and ious electrical faults. It normally takes  years and three months for the problems to develop. . Range Rover Sport A Range Rover Sport does not come cheap, so its unsurprising that the cars most common faults are expensive to fix. Warranty Wise claims the most common fault with the car is its suspension, which on average costs around pound to repair.   More common faults include problems with the alternator, brake faults, electrical faults and EGR Valve faults - and it usually takes around nine years for these problems to build up. For those reasons, it is one of the most unreliable cars on the market.

Both Aldi and Lidl claim to have found a solution for Christmas – buy at a vineyard down the road. Lidl says cheaper bottles whose grapes were grown a few miles away taste as good as those produced at the expensive estates. The German discounter is putting its theory to the test with the launch of its Cote du Rhone wine tour but says “budget needn’t stand in the way of quality”. Its pound. Vacqueyras, AOC,  is made from the same grape shyieties and in the same region as Chacircteauneuf-du-Pape “but without the hefty price tag”, says Master of Wine Richard Bampfield, Lidl’s wine expert.  It is a similar story at rival Aldi. Sam Caporn, a Master of Wine and Aldi’s wine expert, explained how “wines produced in the same terroir, which refers to soil type, geography and climate, share many similar qualities as wine produced from the ‘big names’, which are much more expensive.” The chain’s Veuve Monsigny Champagne Brut, which costs just over pound, has been named one of the best in the world – routinely beating off more expensive houses at blind-tasting competitions. It is made by Philizot et Fils in the village of Reuil, in the shyChampagne region. His vineyard is next to a plot that belonged to Madame Veuve Clicquot – a house which charges at least three times the price of Aldi for a standard bottle – and which was recently sold off to an Armenian buyer.  Steacutephane Philizot started producing his own Champagne in . Recently he has had a helping hand from his wine-making uncle, Geacuterard l’Herondelle, who spent  years as head of wine-making at Champagne Lanson, where a bottle can cost at least pound. Aldi’s relationship with Philizot began in  with , bottles peaking last year with . million bottles sold to shoppers. A new production site, which will make it three times as big, is in operation in order to keep up with the demand from customers. Champagne is one of the most regulated products in the world – ranging for how many grapes can be picked each year to how much each tonne will fetch from. David Elliot, Aldi’s wine buyer, said: “The real skill comes in blending the three grape ieties to make the same great tasting Champagne each year.”  There have been signs the big four supermarkets are trying to replicate the discounters’ success. Tesco’s new discount chain Jack’s is an attempt to create a rival to Aldi and Lidl, which have both enjoyed double-digit growth this year. Analyst Natalie Berg, founder of NBK Retail, said: “Shopping habits have fundamentally changed, and discounters cater well to today’s shopper who expects consistently low prices without sacricing quality. “One of the ways they keep costs down is by limiting the number of products, which means they can achieve better terms with fewer suppliers. The discount model is about simplicity and ruthless efficiency.” For vineyards across Europe – and increasingly those in the south of England, which has the same climate as the Champagne region, a shylong-standing relationship with supermarkets is crucial.

Russell Bishop, , is on trial for the second time for killing Nicola Fellows and Karen Hadaway after new forensic evidence came to light. The nine-year-old friends, dubbed the Babes in the Wood, were sexually assaulted and strangled in Wild Park in Brighton in October . Within three years, Bishop was convicted of abducting, sexually assaulting and trying to kill a seven-year-old girl at Devils Dyke on the South Downs, the Old Bailey has heard. Despite trying unsuccessfully to appeal against his conviction and discretionary le sentence, Bishop told the jury he was deeply ashamed of what he had done in .   Under cross-examination on Monday, he insisted he was not a paedophile but was just bloody angry at a hate campaign against him and thought I might as well do it. Prosecutor Brian Altman QC asked: This was all about revenge  The defendant replied: Partly. Mr Altman went on: So the attempted murder ofwas born out of revenge by virtue of the three years of the hate you and your family suffered  You are portraying yourself as a victim. This offence was all about sexual gratication and you are a paedophile  Bishop denied it.   Mr Altman continued: You enjoy controlling children and one aspect of your control of children, particularly girls, is sexual gratication. Bishop said: No, not in any way. The prosecutor asked: Why did you choose a young girl who was two years younger than the age of the two girls you were accused of murdering  Bishop said: It could have been anyone. Through the psychological trauma of the hate campaign and what everyone  was saying it came out in that behaviour. The defendant said he assaulted the girl to belittle and shame her because I was bloody angry at everyone - at her and everyone who had done that to me. Mr Altman asserted: This is all rubbish. This is all lies.   You attacked that young girl because you had a sexual interest in children. It had nothing to do with three years of hate but everything to do with Russell Bishop and your character, didnt it  There are very good reasons for what I also suggest are obvious and striking similarities between the two offences because the killer of those two girls in October  was the same person who attackedin . And that man is you. As he was being questioned about his sexual interest in children, Bishop became agitated and appealed to the trial judge. He said: Your honour.

Harrop Fold High was deemed inadequate in all five inspection areas by the watchdog in a scathing report published today.The secondary school, which has  pupils, will now move out of local authority control and become an academy, reports the Manchester Evening News.An Ofsted inspection report reads: The school is failing its pupils. Signicant and wide-ranging weaknesses have developed over time. These require urgent improvement. Inspectors identied said there had been informal exclusion of pupils and deliberate misrecording of attendance. In , year  pupils rates of progress in English, mathematics, and science were in the lowest five per cent in the country.  Pupils are poorly prepared for their future lives as successful citizens in modern Britain, the report reads. Inspectors said pupils poor behaviour has led to disrupted teaching and learning in far too many classes. The progress of students is unacceptably weak, Ofsted chiefs added. The schools culture does not encourage pupils to behave well, the report said. This poor behaviour disrupts learning, the report adds. Parents, carers and pupils say there is bullying. The report said four inspectors scrutinised every element of the school. Leadership and management quality of teaching outcomes for pupils personal development, behaviour, and welfare and overall effectiveness were all deemed inadequate. Channel  TV programme Educating Greater Manchester captured le at the Little Hulton school. It painted a picture of a school that former head Drew Povey had transformed after being named one of the worst in the country.This summer, Harrop Fold was plunged into crisis when Mr Povey and three other members of staff were suspended. In September, Mr Povey announced on Twitter that he was leaving, claiming he was the victim of a personal vendetta, which Salford council has denied. The chair of governors resigned in October, followed two senior governors this month. An investigation was launched in July, which is still ongoing, into allegations that children were removed from the school register - a practice known as off-rolling. This could potentially give the impression that the school is performing better than it is,the children expected to do poorly academically are taken off the register. Mr Povey has insisted he has done nothing wrong. Parents and pupils demonstrated to get him re-instated. The Ofsted report reads: Over recent years, year  pupils have been deleted from the school roll shortly before the date of the Department for Educations annual census of schools each January, only to be readmitted at a later date. This type of action means that the examination results of pupils taken off roll temporarily do not appear in school performance tables.  The report adds: In addition, pupils safeguarding has been compromised by the inappropriate and informal exclusion of pupils and by the deliberate misrecording of attendance. There has been insufficient emphasis on particular risks and challenges that pupils may encounter - including drugs, kne crime and gangs. Pupils have not been taught in a sufficiently structured way about when informal ways of speaking and behaving are not appropriate. These failures mean that pupils are poorly prepared for their future lives as successful citizens in modern Britain. The report says schools records of pupils attendance have been inaccurate, in part because some pupils who have known to be absent have had their register mark deliberately changed so they appear as present. In addition, some pupils have gained their present mark and then left the school premises. Worrying issues such as these have meant the leaders and other staff have not known where some pupils are, putting them at risk, the report adds. Bad behaviour of pupils is highlighted as a major issue. There are far too many occasions when pupils stop concentrating, chat to each other or talk over the teacher or class discussion, the report adds. Some pupils prefer to use their mobile telephones in lessons rather than complete the work set. The number of pupils who do not attend lessons but choose to wander around the school is of particular concern. In September an interim head, Damian Owen, and a deputy were appointed. The Ofsted report says there has been limited time for them to respond to the challenges at the school.  The school is currently receiving signicant support from the council through additional staffing and consultants. The investigation launched in the summer is likely to conclude soon and its findings will be considered by a governing body from a school outside Salford. Potentially, the General Teaching Council could be alerted to any signicant findings. Salfords deputy mayor, Coun John Merry, said the Ofsted report made disturbing reading. The inspectors have identied unsafe historic practices at the school, along with poor performance and achievement, he added. Practices include the inappropriate, informal exclusion of pupils, deliberate mis-recording of attendance and weak practice in staff recruitment. This potentially compromised the safeguarding of pupils as leaders and staff have not been in a position to ensure that they are safe. I want to reassure parents that since the start of September the interim senior leadership team has stopped these practices. The Greater Manchester Learning Trust, which is providing the interim leadership, is committed to working alongside a new academy sponsor to provide stability and support for as long as is needed. I know there is a committed and hardworking team at Harrop Fold who want to do their very best for pupils. Ofsted says new approaches introduced in may aspects of school le arer having a real impact, eventhey are at an early stage. It is important that the whole community gets behind the changes and works to common goals. There has been a lot of speculation in the community about hidden agendas. I want to reaffirm that the school, governors, and local authority all want the same thing - for Harrop Fold pupils to be happy, safe, and achieve their best.

William Hannah, who was initially admitted to Salford Royal Hospital after being hit by a car, died several days after the mix-up. It is not knownthe incident played a part in his death. The -year-old, from Bolton, was admitted to the hospital after being hit by a car in September last year, reports the Manchester Evening News.He had suffered serious injuries, including a traumatic brain injury, as well as multiple fractures. Despite treatment, his condition continued to deteriorate and he was moved to the hospitals Critical Care Unit and placed on a ventilator. Mr Hannah then developed a lung infection. Doctors then decided to carry out an emergency procedure to try and clear his lungs and improve his breathing. But the trolley containing the bronchoscopy equipment had not been stocked up ahead of the procedure, a hospital investigation found.  A member of nursing staff was asked by the consultant to get some saline so the bronchial lavage - which sees a small amount of fluid put into the lungs before being removed - could go ahead. However, due to an error in communication and mislabeling of bottles, the doctor was handed a detergent mixture - used for cleaning equipment - instead, which was then used to wash out Mr Hannahs lungs. According to an internal investigation report by Salford Royal Hospital, carried out in the weeks after the grandad-of-threes death, when the mistake was discovered, a second thorough washout of the right lung was carried out. Over the next  hours, Mr Hannahs condition continued to worsen and he began to show symptoms of sepsis and cardiovascular collapse. He passed away on September , . Further testing is currently underway to find out whether the error contributed to Mr Hannahs death. An investigation is also being carried out by a coroner, with an inquest due to take place in February.The serious incident report by Salford NHS bosses concluded multiple factors led to the mistake.It read: Following investigation it was determined that the inadvertent instillation of the incorrect fluid into the patient’s lungs was caused by a number of human factors. These factors include - un-stocked trolley distraction by other le critical tasks lack of clear two-way communication no labelling of bottle inadequate staff training and lack of COSHH risk assessment. The clinical impact of the errors on the patient is unknown at this point therefore we have requested an independent toxicology report to support the pathology results and coronial inquest.  Mr Hannahs loved ones said they were shocked and angry and felt as though he had been let down. They have instructed law firm JMW to investigate further. Mr Hannahs daughter Lisa, , from Whitefield, said: This was an appalling and unbelievable mistake. Eddie Jones, head of clinical negligence at law firm JMW, added: This incident has been very traumatic for William’s family who have not only had to deal with his death but also these appalling circumstances. Their grief has been compounded by this terrible error and they understandably would like to know how something so shocking and avoidable could occur. Dr Pete Turkington, medical director at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, said new measures have since been introduced. He added: “We once again offer our deepest sympathies to William Hannah’s family for the loss of their much-loved family member. “We have carried out a comprehensive investigation examining thoroughly the care Mr Hannah received. We have since shared this information with his family. “The review of Mr Hannah’s care at Salford Royal highlighted that he did not receive the high standard of care we always pride ourselves on delivering and we apologise unreservedly to his family for this. “We have since introduced new measures to ensure something like this will not happen again. “We continue to work with the coroner to determine whether any failings by the trust caused or contributed to Mr Hannah’s death.

John McMullan, , said he was shocked by the scores in a recent PIP assessment for his son Declan, , who is unable to move, talk, see or eat. Claiming he faced ignorant questioning, he said he feared what other disabled people might face during their assessments for the benefit, which is replacing Disability Living Allowance. Belfast Live reports that are neurological condition that means he is unable to control his movements despite being fully aware. He requires -hour care for the condition, which was triggered when his brain was starved from oxygen during an eight-minute cardiac arrest when he was .   When John recently received a letter informing him Declan must be reassessed for the new payment, he expected the change would be made without question. He explained: The form was very easy to fill in because Declan cant do anything other than blink. He is unable to move, talk, see or eat. Doctors told us to imagine being buried alive - that is what Locked-in syndrome is. But three weeks later, I received a phone call from an assessor to ask questions. John claimed the assessor, who wanted to see Declan face-to-face, displayed a total ignorance of his condition. He said: In my opinion, I supplied ample evidence of Declans disability but I doubt they actually understood what is on that paper. I dont think the people assessing are fit to be doing it. Declan achieved the full payment but John said he was shocked to see that he did not achieve full points for his daily living needs. He said: Declan cannot eat and is PEG fed yet the assessor only gave him  points out of  for the level of assistance he needs with eating and drinking. He cannot move at all, only blink, yet the assessor gave him just two out of eight points on whether he needs supervision or assistance managing his therapies. He got   for needing assistance making budgeting decisions and just   for needing support in social situations.   If a GP is telling the government somebody is sick, who is an assessor to question the doctors judgement  How can a PIP assessor be properly qualied to override those doctors  Declans team include occupational therapists, social workers, nurses, doctors, physiotherapists and psychiatrists. A PIP assessor cant be all of that. I knew Declan was never going to be turned down for PIP. It was just the stupidity of the process and the fact even he did not get full points. Declan is probably one of the most disabled people in Northern Ireland. How disabled do you have to be  John said he was convinced the assessors aimed to get as many people off disability benefit as possible and believed a bonus system made them sales people in reverse. Recalling the year and a half Declan spent in hospital following his cardiac arrest, John said they were devastated to be told he was in a borderline vegetative state.   But the family was delighted to realise he could communicate by blinking. One of the first things Declan told his parents was that he wanted to go home. John recalled: That is when our battles began. We had to fight to have the house sorted out for him and we had to take out a bank loan to buy an accessible vehicle as DLA was not available while he was in hospital. I had to fight for a generator to ensure Declan did not die during an electricity outage. And now PIP. How many times do severely disabled people need to be assessed  If professional people are providing professional evidence is that not good enough  When you are disabled, you dont need to prove you are this disabled. A Department for Communities spokesperson said: “The Department expects the highest standards from Capita, who deliver the PIP Assessment Service and they have to conform to a rigorous set of quality standards set down by the Department. Each disability assessor must have a minimum of two years post registration experience which must be fulfilled within an approved health profession and receive extensive training in line with DfC guidelines before they undertake PIP assessments. “Capita is committed to delivering a high quality and empathetic service for people applying for PIP. Its disability assessors are healthcare professionals with the required skills and knowledge to carry out PIP assessments across Northern Ireland. The PIP assessment looks at how iniduals are able to complete a number of key everyday activities. Within each activity there are a number of descriptors, each representing a ying level of ability to carry out the activity. Iniduals receive a point score for each activity, depending on how well they can carry them out and the help they need to do so which is based on the evidence provided and collected. The guidance which disability assessors and PIP case managers are expected to apply is set out in the PIP Assessment Guide. “A robust complaint process is in place for customers who are unhappy with the service provided by Capita which includes the opportunity to escalate a complaint to the Departmentthey feel it has not been satisfactorily resolved. “The terms and conditions of the contracts of employment for Disability Assessors are a matter for Capita and are not set by the Department. However, the Department understands that an annual quality incentive of pound, is wholly based on the Disability Assessor producing consistent high-quality reports on a timely basis and is not related in any way to decisions on entitlement to PIP. “Decisions on iniduals’ entitlement to PIP are made by the Department. Every claim is considered on an inidual basis, and decisions are made based on the available evidence and the relevant legislation.

Karolina Swiercz, who works part-time at a casino, was invited to a black tie event in The Cornerhouse, a leisure complex in Nottingham. For the occasion decided to wear her new designer high heels, which she treated herself to while visiting Paris last month for € . She told Nottinghamshire Live: I had been saving up for them since the beginning of the year, they cost me one months salary and so they meant a lot to me.I went to a black tie event to watch the first screening of the new Robin Hood film and as it was black tie I dressed up.I left at around .pm, I wasnt drunk and I wasnt messing around, me and my friend decided to get the escalator as the lt was right at the bottom. The moment I took the step on the escalator I felt that I had got stuck and I managed to free myself.   Then as I got ‘unstuck’ my other heel got stuck and I was simply trapped. I tried to pull it out, but the stairs were coming to an end and so were my shoes. I tried to remove the trapped heel with no success. Once Miss Swiercz reached the bottom of the escalator her shoe heel was ripped in two and it became wedged at the bottom. She said: Obviously I was in tears as the shoes cost me my monthly salary and took me a long time to save up for them, being a student finances are tight. I even demonstrated to the security that it took me one single step and my shoe was stuck, they witnessed it and agreed with me that it wasn’t my fault.

A spokesman for the Cornerhouse said: We are aware of this incident and we are currently investigating what may have happened. Our escalators are serviced regularly and are checked by our security team daily, with any issues reported and dealt with immediately.

Prof Sir Mike shyRichards, the UK’s former National Cancer Director, said the death toll was “the equivalent to a jumbo jet of people falling from the sky every two weeks.” He is lead author of a Health shyFoundation report urging millions more to undergo checks. It says pressured GPs only refer those with obvious shysymptoms to be checked by specialists. To make matters worse even patients referred are often “bounced back”they don’t meet strict criteria as hospitals are short of equipment. The report compared survival for six cancers against Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway and Sweden.   The chances of dying within five years of diagnosis were highest in Britain for five out of the six cancers. For prostate cancer UK survival rates were the second worst. Prof Richards added: “The NHS set ambitions for England to match the best in relation to cancer survival. Thousands of deaths could be avoidedwe achieved these goals.” Guidelines say patients should be given an urgent cancer referralGPs believe there is at least a % chance they have the disease. Currently % of those referred test positive. “We know patients in the UK are uniquely worried about bothering their GP,” the report adds.   Hospitals send referrals back to GPs arguing they “do not fit the criteria” because NHS trusts do not have enough scanners or shyspecialists to operate them. The Unfinished Business report said compared to  wealthy countries the UK has the third fewest CT shyscanners and sixth fewest MRI shyscanners per head. Co-author Rebecca Fisher, a GP, said: “There is very limited capacity. The later cancer is diagnosed the more likely you are to die from it. “We need to move it from referring to confirm a diagnosis, towards shyreferring to rule cancer out.” The report says GPs could be bypassed and patients given cancer checks in “one-stop shops” at supermarkets. Home testing kits should be expanded for shyconditions such as bowel cancer and there should be more cancer specialists and shyscanners. Emma Greenwood, Cancer Research UK’s director of policy, said: “This powerful report shows how far we still have to go in giving cancer patients the best chances of survival.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast storm diana","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Storm Diana to hit Britain with FLOODING and mph windsThe Met Office has issued yellow danger to le weather warnings for heavy rain and strong winds for large parts of the countryShareCommentsByChris kitching:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video warnings-place-watch-weather-forecast-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHomes and roads are at risk of flooding and millions of Britons could face travel disruption as Storm Diana threatens chaos across the country.

Yogvedant Poddar was detained by police after a fellow passenger alerted the crew that they’d seen him send a message on the social media  including the words ‘terrorist’ and ‘destroy’. The caption of his Snapchat post read: “Terrorist on flight, I destroy women’s hearts”. The Jet Airways flight was taxiing and preparing for take-off for its journey from Kolkata to Mumbai on Monday, when a passenger informed air stewards of the worrying message.  One of the attendants then informed the pilot of the potential threat, before air traffic control were finally alerted. The -year-old was then arrested by authorities and taken in for questioning. Airport officials said Mr Poddar was detained for mischievous activity on board and for using language which was inferred as a security threat. They said: “After taking his seat, he covered his face with a handkerchief and started sending WhatsApp messages from his phone,” airport officials were quoted as saying. “A co-passenger sitting next to Poddar got suspicious, given his behavior of covering the face, and read the message he was typing on his phone. “The pilot told the airline security, and the Central Industrial Security Force was informed about Poddar. A CISF team immediately took custody of Poddar and made him get off the aircraft.” Pilot flies nearly km past destination after falling asleep mid-airAt first, Poddar refused to show his phone to authorities. The post was later confirmed to be an distasteful joke, leaving the prankster “traumatised”, according to one police officer. In a statement the officer said:“[Mr Poddar] was visibly traumatised and told the officers that he is not a terrorist. He pleaded innocence and told the officers that he was just playing a prank with his friends.” As well as conducting a search of Mr Poddar’s belongings, the flight was also grounded for more than an hour as security conducted a full search of the aircraft before clearing it for take-off. Security forces in India are said to be on high alert as yesterday marked  years since the Mumbai terror attacks, which left  people dead. Mr Poddar was later released from custody.

Terrying footage shows holidaymaker Chris Gursky clinging to the hang-glider for more than two minutes as he thought he faced certain death. His left hand grips the metal bar while his right hand is firmly on the pilots back or leg before they touch down and he is sent tumbling in a field. Chris near death experience - on the first day of his trip to Switzerland - left him with a broken wrist and torn bicep, but the outcome could have been much worse.  Despite his brush with death, the American tourist, from Florida, wants to go hang-gliding again and has joked that he would try base jumping next. He wrote on YouTube, where the GoPro clip, titled Swiss Mishap, has more than half a million views: My first time Hang Gliding turned into a near death experience as my safety harness was never hooked to the Glider. For  Min.  seconds I had to hang on for my le! The landing was a rough one, but I lived to tell the story.  Heart-stopping footage shows Chris and the pilot running and setting off from a ,ft mountain edge. His harness isnt hooked up to the aircraft and it becomes immediately clear that something is seriously wrong, as Chris is left dangling and clinging on to the bar and pilot for le. The pilot struggles to maintain control and steer - with one hand on Chris and the other on the bar - as he looks for a place to make an emergency landing.  They flow low over homes and then veer over treetops as they gain altitude and approach a valley with mountains and a bright blue lake in the distance. By now the pilot has regained control as Chris holds onto his leg and the bar, fearing he wont be able to maintain his grip for much longer. The pair are whipped by the wind as they approach a field and land at about mph.  Chris lets go and tumbles, breaking his right wrist. His left bicep tendon was torn as he dangled from the hang-glider. The pilot lands safely moments later and immediately looks back at injured Chris. He was taken to a local hospital, where a titanium plate and seven screws were needed to repair his broken wrist during surgery.Chris pointed out that the outcome could have been much worse, writing: It beats the alternative.  He added: “While the pilot made a critical error in our pre-flight setup by not attaching me to the glider, he did all he could to get me down to the ground as quickly as possible, while grabbing on to my harness and flying with one hand. “I will go hang-gliding again as I did not get to enjoy my first flight.” The incident happened in October while Chris was on holiday in Switzerland with his we Gail, who also went hang-gliding but had no problems during her flight.The couple celebrated their th wedding anniversary this month.  Chris wrote on Facebook: My body weight shted straight down and I found myself hanging on for my le. I ended up holding on bar with the left hand and the lower part of his leg with the right when we were nearing the ground. I looked down to see my feet hit first, which ripped me off at about  mph as it was a hot landing and I was under the landing gear. I would guesstimate the total flight time was about  minutes. When I sat up I knew something was wrong and saw that my wrist was broken. He added: I remember looking down and thinking, this is it. I was losing grip with my right hand, that was holding onto a strap on the pilots right shoulder. The pilot grabbed my hand, but like in the movies it was a slow motion slipping of the grip until my right hand slipped off and I grabbed another strap on his left side for a bit but this slipped off also.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"bustling prestwick town praised national","story":"NewsBustling Prestwick town praised on national stageThe town landed second place in Scotland at the Great British High Street Awards last week.ShareByPippa Smith:,  NOV NewsSuccess Prestwick is boom town \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBustling business in Prestwick has been praised on the national stage.

It will be deal or no deal.I wonrsquot pretend the deal is perfect.No-one gets everything they want in a negotiation ndash and wersquove had two years of tough negotiations with the EU.So the deal is a compromise.If between now and the final vote in Parliament we learn the deal does not deliver everything wersquove promised our fishing industry, Irsquoll not be able to support it.And the same goes for Northern Ireland.I need to be sure the so-called backstop plan does not threaten the integrity of the UK by creating fundamentally dferent, permanent arrangements for Northern Ireland.But Irsquom encouraged those risks have been avoided because itrsquos clear the arrangements focus on the specic circumstances in Northern Ireland ndash the need to honour the Belfast Agreement and maintain the fragile peace process, and to avoid a hard border with Ireland. One thing I am absolutely certain about is this: a no deal Brexit would be a disaster for Scotland and the whole of the UK.It would harm the economy, threaten jobs and damage peoplersquos standards of living. I will do everything I can to stop that happening.Irsquove been disappointed by the soap opera of cabinet resignations over the past few days and Irsquom dismayed that colleagues might yet try to force a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister.That would be a huge distraction at the worst possible moment.It is time for MPs on all sides to recognise that the alternative to the deal we have negotiated is leaving the EU without a deal. I hope that nightmare prospect really focuses minds in the days ahead.There is nothing to stop the SNP and Labour backing the deal. It achieves key goals set out in their own Brexit plans, like protecting trade and citizensrsquo rights. However, to support their own political objectives, they currently plan to vote against the proposed agreement.Prime Minister Theresa May has shown resolve, determination and strength of character as we move towards the final, dficult stages of the Brexit process.

new high school as soon as possible and unite the townrsquos politicians behind a united front.Scottish Borders Council launched a review of all educational facilities in the Borders in September , with a view to building new schools, assessing which schools may need to be merged or closed, and considering how appropriate current catchment areas are.Education bosses at the council are known to prefer an intergenerational model of education, such as the poundm campus at Jedburgh which will cater for - year olds and contain community spaces and a library.In April , Scottish Borders Council agreed to create inidualised plans for schools in Galashiels, Hawick, Peebles and Selkirk, and agreed to bring an update to the council in October.However, the update has so far failed to materialise leaving parents and students in the dark about the future of their school.John Lamont, who represents Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk in Westminster, said: ldquoHawick High School has had its fair share of publicity recently, but it is clear that hard working pupils and staff are being let down by a site which is simply not fit for purpose.ldquoThat is why I have joined with my colleague Rachael, to call on the townrsquos representatives to come together for the good of the town.ldquoGalashiels is already the front runner to get a new school, because the town and the community is united and has a clear plan.ldquoHawick is lucky to have very active local representatives who have already put in a lot of work in to securing a new school for the town.ldquoNow is the time for the community and for its representatives to come together to focus on delivering for Hawickrsquos pupils, teachers and parents.ldquoIf we argue amongst ourselves about details, the effect will be that Hawick is put to the back of the queue.Rachael Hamilton, who represents Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire in Holyrood, added: ldquoMaking a decision on a site would give pupils, teachers and parents a real boost.ldquoOther towns in the Borders have been fortunate to benefit from a new modern teaching and learning environment and Hawick is clearly in need of some investment.ldquoPolitical infighting wonrsquot help, clarity should be provided over such an important issue, this is about giving young people and future generations a place to be proud of.The townrsquos councillors have welcomed the intervention of the two politicians, and threw their weight behind the campaign.Councillor Stuart Marshall commented: ldquoI think itrsquos very important that all politicians, councillors and community leaders join forces to continue the campaign for a new high school.ldquoOf course funding such a project will be a major factor in whether we can deliver such a project, and itrsquos great that both our Westminster and Holyrood representatives in the area are throwing their weight behind such an initiative.ldquoLet us hope that between them they can come up with much of the finances required.Councillor Watson McAteer said: ldquoI am delighted that our local elected UK and Scottish Conservative politicians are throwing their weight and influence behind a new high school for Hawick.ldquoI am in complete agreement that politics should have no role in deciding the future of our children and by definition our town and the quicker this project is agreed by all the better.ldquoHawick High School has seen its fair share of problems and a new learning campus would go a long way to resolving existing and future problemsCouncillor David Paterson added: ldquoAll of the Hawick councillors are campaigning furiously to get a new high school for Hawick, and the councillors in other wards are shouting for their areas as well.ldquoIrsquod like John Lamont MP to encourage the Tory government to make more money available to the Scottish Government to make this into a reality.The proposals to create inidual plans for Galashiels, Hawick, Selkirk and Peebles came

are performing well and operating effectively and D indicating that the economic le of the facilities has expired and they are at risk of failure.The overall conditions of Galashiels Academy, Hawick

Council has published a belated update on its much-anticipated school estates review, and it reveals that Galashiels is the top priority to receive new investment, with Hawick second, Selkirk third and Peebles fourth.Education chiefs are recommending that councillors approve plans for a pound.m cross-generational campus in Galashiels, which would be due to open in .The plans would see , secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students,  primary school pupils and  nursery children educated across the campus, to be split between the new Langlee Primary School and a new building at either Scott Park or Netherdale.Although the cross-generational campus is the preferred model outlined by council officers, there would be a public consultation which would explore alternative options, which includes a new standalone secondary school building which would cost pound.m.The costs outlined in the report are currently indicative but would be confirmed once a detailed delivery strategy is drawn up.The report states: ldquoWhile both Galashiels and Hawick high schools are both classed as grade C in relation to their condition, Galashiels will require signicantly more financial investment on an element-by-element fabric basis in order to remain a fully ing asset with no impact on the delivery of the curriculum.ldquoIt is recommended therefore that Galashiels is the first priority for investment given the current condition and suitability of the existing school in relation to the rest of the estate.If the report is approved by councillors, Hawick would be the second town to receive investment in its school estates.As in Galashiels, council officers are recommending the construction of a cross-generational campus, due to open in , at a cost of pound.m.The campus would cater for  secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students, , primary school pupils and  nursery children.Again, the option to create either a cross-generational campus or just a stand-alone secondary school at a cost of pound.m would be discussed with Hawick residents.However, issues relating to flooding risk and available space have led to Hawick missing out on first priority place as council officers do not currently have a concrete plan for where any new campus would be sited.The report continues: ldquoThere are other complex issues within Hawick aside from questions of scale and accessibility, in particular with relation to flood risk.ldquoWhile the existing high school site in Hawick has been included within the options appraisal, it is noted that further detailed investigations are required regarding the currently proposed flood prevention works at this site and the nature of permissible development works which could render this and other adjacent town centre sites undevelopable for an education project of this scale.ldquoThe Hawick flood protection scheme will deliver protection to the town generally at a level commensurate with one in -year flood events.ldquoEarly advice is that any new school provision on the same site or at the same level would require to achieve, a higher level of protection commensurate with its classication as a strategic asset.ldquoIn addition, other sites are already identied within the local development plan in terms of business, mixed use or industrial zoning, and this could have a detrimental impact on the wider economic health of the townutilised for educational purposes and an analysis would therefore be required.Selkirk would be the third priority for new investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m cross-generational campus, potentially due to open in .As with the campus recommendations at Hawick and Galashiels, there would be a public consultation that would consider just building a replacement secondary school, at a cost of pound.mThe report states: ldquoFrom experience with the Jedburgh intergenerational campus model, it is considered appropriate that a three-to- campus option could be considered for the Selkirk cluster.ldquoThis could comprise all the schools within the town and potentially a partial inclusion of the rural schools within the cluster, as was suggested during the pre-consultations, with pupils from P and P transitioning to the campus.,params: .pushldquoPrevious consultation with the community has focused on secondary education. It is therefore proposed that further consultation is undertaken with the community, parents, pupils and staff to determine the preferred option in terms of educational model.ldquoThis will help develop a proposal to take forward to the next stage of the process. Discussions will also be progressed with the public, private and third sector regarding the potential for other services to share services and facilities.Peebles has been designated as the lowest priority for a new school but it would receive the largest investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m campus to be opened in .The alternative would be a new secondary school building at a cost of poundm.The report continues: ldquoPrimary and secondary schools within Peebles currently have limited capacity for increased roll numbers, which is the main concern in this location as opposed to issues of condition at Galashiels and Hawick.ldquoBoth Priorsford and Kingsland primary schools are operating at  per cent capacity and Peebles High School at  per cent capacity, and further work on projected roll figures is required.ldquoIt is recommended that any decision to build a new school or campus model must form part of an overall Scottish Borders Council masterplan for the town taking cognisance of projected housing developments, transport links, infrastructure, including flood risk, and the local development plan.The campus model is favoured by council officers and the elected administration as consolidating educational provision in one or two locations would allow the closure of disused school buildings and reduce annual running costs.The report will be presented at the next full council meeting, to be held next Thursday, November , and councillors will be asked to approve the priority and sequence of investments."},{"url":null,"title":"50k-boost-for-museum-from-festival-of-speed","story":"MORE than pound, has been donated to a Borders museum by organisers of the Goodwood Festival of Speed.And a

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-84-enjoys-microlight-flight","story":"Jenny Lyall, , was the passenger in a microlight, taking off from East Fortune Airfield, earlier this month.The small aircraft, piloted by Kim Ritchie, gave Jenny the chance to look over her home in Haddington.Clients at the townrsquos day centre, managed by Caroline Scott, have been outlining things they would like to do, from having a holiday in the spring to going on the London Eye.For Jenny, though, it was a chance to take to the skies.She said: ldquoIrsquove always watched the microlights going over and would be sitting in the garden saying: lsquoI quite fancy doing that.rsquoldquoWhen Caroline askedthere was anything anybody would like to do I said I would like to go up in a microlight.A few days later Jenny received a phone call telling her there was a surprise for her at the day centre and she said she was thrilled when she found out that was a microlight flight, adding: ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed it ndash I would do it again tomorrow.ldquoNot bad for an -year-old!Caroline was delighted to be able to help.

The move angered the students association because it holds a sale of second hand gowns to help fund student support services.:University principals urged to take tougher political line on BrexitLegal representatives of St Andrews are alleging Churchill Gowns advertised their products in such a way that suggested \"a  endorsement by or association with the university\" and thus was \"likely to deceive the public into a mistaken belief\" that the goods being sold were official university products.The Churchill website currently states: \"The red undergraduate gown is an icon of the University of St Andrews, and part of a tradition much loved by its students.\"Made from a fleece blend fabric with a velveteen collar, the scarlet gown also undoubtedly serves to keep students cosy and warm, even on the Scottish coast.\"At Churchill Gowns you can order your red St Andrews undergraduate gown brand new. Our St Andrews undergraduate gowns are made to university specications.\"Churchill Gowns have been asked not to sell any university gowns or goods with the trade marks \"University of St Andrews\" or \"St Andrews\" and not to pass themselves off as being associated with, endorsed by, or connected with \"the university or its business\".However, Churchill Gowns defended its methods and said it would continue to advertise and sell its red gowns to students from St Andrews.The company said its online sales page had a clear disclaimer stating: ldquoChurchill Gowns is not affiliated with and does not represent this institution in any way.Oliver Adkins, the UKs managing director of Churchill Gowns, said the business was founded to offer students a more affordable and sustainable alternative to traditional academic dress suppliers.He said: \"We believe participation in these ancient traditions should not be reserved for those who can afford to pay a premium, and instead should be open to all.\"Itrsquos a shame that the University of St Andrews are seeking to deny students this choice and have gone to such extreme s to protect the profits they make.\"Churchill Gowns has never sought to prevent students from buying a university endorsed gown. However, we will strongly defend our right to compete in the marketplace and offer a more affordable option to students for whom a pound price tag is out of reach.\"A spokesman for St Andrews said: \"We believe in responsible enterprise, and that students should expect the purchase of a red gown to be a decision based on clear and consistent information.\"The purpose of the cease and desist letter is to make clear the concerns of the university and its students. In our view it is not sufficient that a company states it is not affiliated with the university, while it also claims gowns are made to university specications.: Parents warned of unprecedented school cuts and redundancies\"This is a  endorsement, which we believe constitutes mis-selling of gowns to students who believe they will be of equivalent quality to the official university gown.\"We know student representatives are understandably concerned that students are being led unwittingly to purchase gowns that are dferent from official gowns, which do not support the Student Association or teaching and research within the university as official gowns do, and that a unique student tradition is being diminished by this confusion. Association staff take seriously their duty to protect student interests, and we expect them to do so robustly and fairly.\"Earlier this year, an independent adviser to the Scottish Government on widening access argued the wearing of the red gown at St Andrews was elitist.Professor Peter Scott said at the time: \"A university such as St Andrews, that prides itself on its traditions, needs to take into account the fact that that might act as a bit of a put-off for certain applicants.\"Students there parade around in red gowns.

In his BBC interview Raab pointedly refused to endorse Theresa Mays mantra ldquono deal is better than a bad deal. And the Prime Minister is not saying that any more either. If no deal is out and the PMs Withdrawal Agreement is toast, it means Brexit is now seriously stalled. This opens the way for the entire process to be halted,an when parliament rejects the May deal emphatically and finally, as it must next month.Yet at the beginning of the week, it rather looked asTheresa May was going to succeed in delivering her Chequers-derived exit deal. So what happened  Two events led up to this important juncture: the failed ldquoDads Army coup and the publication of the Political Declaration.The vainglorious attempt by the European Research Group of hard Brexit Tory MPs, led by Jacob Rees Mogg, to organise a coup against the Prime Minister was a dismal failure. They failed to gather enough votes even for a leadership contest to be triggered. It exposed the entire hard Brexit faction of the Conservative Party to ridicule and underlined their own irrelevance. Strike one to Theresa May.Suddenly, the press started to feature more positive images of the PM: no longer the hapless, bumbling dancing queen but a serious politician doing her best, a stateswoman even. One Tory backbench supporter said her opponents were motivated by ldquomisogyny and many women appeared to agree. A YouGov Times polls showed that the PMs approval rating had risen  points in one week.But then came what was probably the crunch moment in the entire two and a half years of Brexit negotiations: the publication of the  page Political Declaration. This was supposed to outline Britainrsquos future trading relations with the EU after Brexit. It didnrsquot. The painful reality is that nothing has been agreed.To say that the document is woolly is an insult to sheep. It is a disingenuous confection of warm words, empty declarations and wishful thinking that no one could possibly take seriously. The only thing it really delivered was a surfeit of adjectives - ldquoambitious, broad, deep and flexible - without the slightest hint of how Mrs Mays ldquofrictionless trade deal could ever be achieved. It amounted, as the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon observed, to the release of a herd of unicorns.Theresa May insists that the PD outlines ldquoa unique trading relationship with the EU, but it does nothing of the kind. It promises: ldquoa free trade area as well as wider sectoral cooperation where it is in the mutual interest of both Parties. But the reality is that the mutual interests of the parties, the UK and the EU, are irreconcilably opposed, not least because of the PMrsquos red lines on immigration and the single market. At bottom, the Political Declaration only guarantees a Canada-style free trade agreement.The document makes clear that the EU will regard the UK as a ldquothird country, and that further participation by the UK in the single market involves: ldquorespecting the integrity of the Unionrsquos Single Market and the Customs Union and the inisibility of the four freedoms. If Britain accepts the common rules or ldquolevel playing field on trade and services, it has also to accept ldquothe integrity of the Unionrsquos legal order... including the role of the Court of Justice of the European Unionin the interpretation of Union law.This has been compared to the kind of control the old Soviet Union exercised over nominally autonomous republics like the Ukraine. Thats unfair: the EU is not a communist dictatorship. But it does look very like the current EU arrangement with Turkey, which is in the Customs Union for goods but not in the EU. This is because of Britains commitment to the Northern Irish backstop in the draft Withdrawal Agreement, which accompanies the Political Declaration.The backstop began le as an attempt to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland, but has ended up placing the UK in an intolerable position for a sovereign nation: having to accept laws over which it has no control. Dominic Raab is absolutely right. This is far worse than remaining in the European Union. Right now, the UK is fully represented, not just in the EU parliament and the Brussels commission, but as a member of the Council of Ministers, is part of the supreme decision-making body of the Union. This gives the UK an effective veto matters of vital national interest.Britain loses this power next March, when we leave the EU. Thereafter we will still have to accept EU laws during the transition period and throughout the backstop arrangement, which will continue unless and until there is a new frictionless trade deal negotiated. The Political Declaration made clear that there isnt the remotest sign of such a deal happening.In the backstop, Theresa May has agreed for the UK to remain in the Customs Unionand for Northern Ireland to remain largely in the single market. Worse still, Britain can only leave the backstop by mutual agreement with the EU, which gives Brussels an effective veto on Britainrsquos departure from it. As Dr Kirsty Hughes has pointed out, the transition backstop places the UK in the same subordinate position as Turkey, a country which is trying to enter the EU but has not met the relevant conditions. Britain will have a legal obligation to follow trading rules on which it has no say.Does Theresa May understand how the EU s  She says that Britain is restoring its ldquosovereignty in the Withdrawal Agreement. Yet the truth is, the UK never lost its sovereignty in the  years it was in the EU. This was stated clearly in paragraph . of the UK governments own White Paper in February . However, under the Withdrawal Agreement Britain really does stand to lose sovereignty, and become a country whose laws governing trade are set by a foreign entity.That  page document was a tightly-drafted legal text, written in a language accessible only to lawyers. Now the Political Declaration has, by its very vagueness, exposed Britains dilemma with crystal clarity: we are in danger of making a mistake of historic proportions. It is simply impossible to contemplate Britain agreeing to this, and no responsible national legislature should accept it. No longer is British sovereignty ldquopooled in the EU, it is effectively relinquished.I dont blame Brussels for this. They wish Britain well, but their priority has always been to protect the integrity of the European Single Market while avoiding a hard border in Ireland. The EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, simply stuck to his brief. Theresa May tied herself in linguistic contortions, trying to gain privileged access to the EU without being a member of it. That was never going to happen. Like M.C. Escherrsquos impossible staircase, the negotiations always ended up at the beginning.MPs must now help Dominic Raab to draw the obvious conclusion, revoke Article  and halt the process. Dead. Say no to no say."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9063295.jpg?type=article-full","title":"uk-eu-brexit-agreement-has-sold-out-scotland-says-mike-russell","story":"Mr Russell said the Withdrawal Agreement, signed off by EU leaders in Brussels on Sunday, would also sell out vital national industries.The Scottish Government said it will publish its analysis this week of the impact the deal could have on the Scottish economy and living standards.This is a bad deal for Scotland,done against our wishes  our interests.

It says this may be a primary factor in the attainment gap.It points out that in a survey carried out by the Child Poverty Action Group in Glasgow, one in  families said they had been forced to turn to foodbanks in order to feed their children during the school holidays. The report concludes that a direct cash payment would provide the most \"dignied\" way to ease the financial pressure on such families.The Scottish Government has the power to set up new benefits, but the report also calls on councils and charities to work with central government to set up universal holiday clubs, to help provide opportunities for children and help families manage the cost of childcare. It says school meals are withdrawn during holidays, just when families face other pressures such as increased childcare costs, and the loss of other key supports including breakfast clubs, after school activities and pastoral support in school.And it says a school holidays tsar should be appointed to ensure a more consistent approach cross Scotland.Douglas Hamilton, Poverty and Inequality Commission chair, said: \"School holidays make up a quarter of the year, so it is no surprise that they can create signicant pressures for Scotlands poorest families around finances, food, opportunities for play, social isolation and parenting.Read More: Council plans free school meals all year long\"The holidays bring additional costs and challenges to already hard-pressed families, particularly over the six-week summer break and at Christmas.\"Free school meals are seen as a vital benefit for the rest of the year but are, in effect, withdrawn during school holidays at a time when families face the most financial pressures.\"The Commission believes that money is the most dignied way to respond to food insecurity, offering families choice in how to meet their needs.\"Thats why our report recommends that the Scottish Government introduce an additional cash benefit during school holiday periods in recognition of the additional costs that families face.\"Councillor Stephen McCabe, Cosla Children and Young People spokesman, welcomed the report and said in general terms local authorities work closely with their partners to address child poverty.He said: \"We know from our own data that the vast majority of local authorities provide some form of out of school hours provision for children and young people experiencing poverty.\"Whilst food is a part of this it is also focused on activities and parental support and involvement.

And the internet is now well and truly bad. Of course, no technology is bad in and of itself, it can only assume a moral dimension thanks to the purpose humanity puts it to ndash but we humans have definitely pointed the web down a dark and nasty path.New research shows that  per cent of Britons believe at least one conspiracy theory. People who voted Brexit are more likely to believe a conspiracy theory, but Remainers are far from immune ndash  per cent of Leave voters believed at least one outlandish tinfoil-hatted scare story, compared to  per cent of pro-EU voters. Some  per cent of Leavers believed Muslim migration was part of a plot to create an Islamic majority in the UK ndash six per cent of Remainers believed the same nonsense.I donrsquot raise this issue to make a political point ndash I raise it to make a social point, for these conspiracy theories are bred online. The research was conducted over six years and in nine countries by academics at Cambridge University and pollsters at YouGov. One of the lead researchers, John Naughton, found that conspiracy theorists were early adopters of the internet as they realised it could help peddle their madness where the mainstream media ndash with its experts, facts, and statistics ndash would not. Professor Naughton calls the top tier of conspiracy theorists ndash the likes of David Icke with his lizards, and Alex Jones with his InfoWars ndash ldquoconspiracy entrepreneurs, as they make a hell of a lot of money out of propagating claims that a monkey in a tree would have trouble believing.The internet allows lies to prosper ndashwhether itrsquos claims that Jews run the world, or the Democratic Party is a paedophile ring, or Muslims are taking over Europe ndash and these lies play into our politics, infect and inform it, distort it.If you focus on this latest research you get the shuddering sense that the net has curdled our minds, but look beyond that research and yoursquoll see that itrsquos set rot in everywhere.Some years back, I made a documentary about extreme pornography ndash one of the things that shocked me while researching the film was the rise of impotence among young men. These young men had been raised on a diet of online pornography so out there that when it came to sex with ordinary young women they couldnrsquot perform. Now, I am no prude and I see pornography as just another part of our adult world, but when sexuality is expressed in a form primarily of degradation, violence and complete objectication no good can really come to the human spirit.Letrsquos move away from the bedroom to the outside world ndash it has been corroded by the internet as surely as acid melts plastic. Look at your high street, itrsquos either dead or dying. Itrsquos a smear of betting shops and charity shops. Your local bookshop has gone, the local clothes store has gone, the list goes on. That is not a result of giant supermarkets ndash they did for your butcher and baker ndash itrsquos a result of you shopping online. You sailed up the Amazon and killed off your local entrepreneurs.Even the seemingly positive side of the internet has negatively changed society ndash think of the benefits of email, then think of all the posties it put out of work.

Most people just shop with the internet giants ndash thatrsquos not choice, thatrsquos domination.And so what do we do  We canrsquot just sit and cry boo-hoo itrsquos all so dficult. We canrsquot just shrug our shoulders and say well thatrsquos the world, buster, like it or lump it.

Having grown up in the north-east of Scotland and witnessed the decline of once-thriving fishing towns like Fraserburgh and Peterhead, it was easy to understand why. Designed to safeguard the sustainability of the seas, the CFP necessarily restricted the size of the catch local vessels could bring in, with the number of fishermen working on Scottish boats halving between the s and the late s as a result. The north-east, which accounts for around a quarter of the total Scottish workforce, bore the brunt of that decline, with Fraserburgh seeing numbers fall by  per cent while in Peterhead they dropped by  per cent.The damage this has wreaked on the local economy has been immense, with high streets that in the s were filled with bustling shops and chintzy cafes all but dead while the windows of countless private residences, once resplendent with Royal Doulton figurines, have been boarded up. With heroin addiction continuing to claim the lives of too many youngsters who at one time would have been destined for a le at sea, wouldnrsquot you too have voted to break away from the remote political institution whose desk-bound bureaucrats had caused all those ills The problem is that holding the EU ndashand the CFP in particular ndash responsible for all the problems that have befallen such communities ignores the influence of way too many other factors. Such as the fact that the licences required to operate within the rules of the CFP have been allocated by the UK and Scottish governments in such a way that large super-trawlers have been able to flourish at the expense of the smaller-scale fishermen who were once the mainstay of the fishing industry. Indeed, while there are more than , vessels licensed to fish in Scotland, in  two-thirds of the catch by weight was landed by just  super-trawlers.Or the fact that the heroin epidemic that has rendered so many in the north-east incapable of following their forbears out to sea sprang up due to an abundance, rather than lack of, wealth. Though fishermen had long been known for their hard-drinking ways when back on shore, the nineties generation began dabbling in narcotics, spending their hard-earned but plentul cash on party drugs before making the inevitable move on to heroin and addiction.And yet, as has become abundantly clear in recent weeks, while the CFP alone is not the cause of all the fishing industryrsquos ills, neither will quitting the EU be the remedy, with Prime Minister Theresa Mayrsquos withdrawal agreement all but spelling out that fishing rights will be up for grabs as part of EU-UK trade negotiations. This should come as no surprise given that Norway, which allows EU boats to fish in its waters infor market access, has long been held up as the fishing nation the UK should seek to emulate, but itrsquos not what the Leave campaign led the fishing industry to believe.On top of that, while ldquotaking back control of our waters will inevitably turn out to mean continuing to share control of our waters, Scottish business relationships that have built up because Norway stayed out of the single market will also suffer. Indeed, as Norway pays higher tarfs for processed products than it does for whole fish it sends much of its catch to Scotland, Denmark and Poland to be processed before the finished products make their way tarf-free into the EU. With UK-EU tarfs likely to be imposed it is hard to imagine those Scottish interests surviving the Brexit process, with scores of jobs being lost as a result.It is certainly true that the overly centralised CFP has led to many problems, with absurd amounts of waste being caused by quota-bound fisherman throwing tonnes of dead fish back into the water each year rather than breach the Brussels-set rules. And, yes, the voices of fishermen whose intimate knowledge of the seas has been passed down from generation to generation have been ignored in favour of a one-size-fits-all bureaucratic approach. But as things stand, the best our fishermen can hope for is a continuation of much of what the CFP provides for without the UK ever having a hope of being able to change it.As happened in so many other areas during the Brexit campaign, our fishing communities were sold a lie by the likes of Mr Farage. Having had their deeply held frustrations and fears exploited, surely they now deserve the right for an informed say.

And the disastrous alternative of a No Deal hard Brexit is also not what was on offer then. So MPs cannot claim to have a democratic mandate to vote for either of these alternatives. But equally, they have no mandate to vote for us to remain in the EU.Mrs May is now trying to sell her deal to the people ndash thatrsquos fine. But fairness demands that the people are then allowed to have their say in a new referendum, choosing between the three options open to us: Remain, Mayrsquos Brexit and no deal Brexit.No doubt there will be those who will argue that a second referendum, which could overturn the result of the  vote, is undemocratic. But that is clearly nonsense. What would be undemocratic would be to deny voters the opportunity to make a better-informed choice. Although many doubts remain over the details of the two Brexit options now on offer, they are nevertheless far more certain than the fantasy Brexit peddled in  by Messrs Johnson and Rees-Mogg and their right-wing supporters.In addition, the right to vote in this referendum should be extended to include both  and -year-olds and EU nationals who have settled and pay their taxes here. Whatever the result of the referendum, it will have a far greater long-term impact on the lives of the young than on those of us who have retired . So to deny  and -year-olds a voice would be indefensible.

She claims that knowing the actual terms of the deal, as we now do, makes no dference and has no bearing on the decision taken in the  referendum. That is nonsense ndash far too many were ldquoconned then by the weasel words of Boris Johnston and his friends.Mrs May is taking an astonishing position on a matter of enormous economic and political importance, which will have an effect on every level and aspect of British society for decades to come. She must surely know that there are still deep isions in the country, in Parliament and even in her own party at Westminster. But after the y national debate the British people are now much better informed than when they voted in the referendum, and more aware of the valuable economic and cultural benefits we have enjoyed for the last  years.Of course the fierce nationalistic Brexiteers will still want to ldquotake back our freedom. But many ordinary citizens have now belatedly recognised the many benefits they have enjoyed through EU membership, including the positive impact of EU citizens coming to Britain to work in our health service and other industries. These people have not been ldquotaking our jobs, they have mostly been filling the jobs we did not want to do ourselves. And the ease of movement for British citizens throughout Europe, both for holidays and for business, is now something we take for granted and will miss badly.I fervently hope that the Prime Minister will give the British people the final say in whether we leave the EU, with a decisive referendum in January or February . That would surely be the democratic and sensible thing to do.Iain AD Mann, Kelvin Court, Glasgow.YOU inform us that Theresa May has said that we cannot get a better deal with the EU than the one she has recently signed up to.Dear Mrs May ndash our present agreement as a full member of the EU is by far a better deal.

Albaredahope readers will Make Someones Day on St Andrews Day on November  and to then celebrate our art and culture on Fair Saturday on December  to help raise funds for good causes. Well, thanks to a new campaign by the Scottish Government, we don’t have to imagine the outcome.For that dream will become a reality on November , with people across the country being asked to commit to doing something nice for someone  on St Andrew’s Day.The Maake Someone’s Day initiative aims to celebrate our generous nature.On Saturday, December , we’re also being invited to take part in the first Fair Saturday here, a celebraion of art and culture while raising funds and awareness for charities.A helping hand...making someones day need not cost a penny. Why not pop in on an elderly relative or neighbour and make their day Founded in Spain in  to combat Black Friday’s commercialism, it is now a global movement.But Scotland is the first nation to sign up as a whole.Ben Macpherson, Minister for Europe, Migration and International Development, was delighted to launch the initiative.He said: “This St Andrew’s Day presents an inspiring opportunity for people in Scotland, in all our ersity, to celebrate the inclusive, outward-looking and compassionate spirit of our nation – by helping others and showing our generosity.Pause for thought...consider buying a homeless person a hot meal or drink to help make their St Andrews Day.“We can all show the best of what it means to be Scottish by each doing something small to #MakeSomeonesDay. “If each of us does something kind for someone , together we can make a hugely positive impact.“We wanted our national day to act as a focal point to showcase the Scots’ generous spirit and nature.data-src\"https:images.johnstonpress jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Missing teenager Liam Smith\"  Liam Smith: Search widens viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"“This is not about how much you can spend it’s about little acts of kindness that mean so much more.“We’re asking people to make time for elderly neighbours, donate goods to charity shops, hold a charity bake sale at work, volunteer time to a good cause or gt a meal or hot drink to a homeless person.“Everyone can get involved – all you have to do is make someone’s day.”The initiative is tied in with Fair Saturday which next year will take place on St Andrew’s Day itself.Ben added: “We’re linking in with the event this year so we can build up to having a major celebration in .“Fair Saturday gives communities across the country a chance, through arts and culture, to celebrate what it means to be Scottish in the st century.“We live in a multiculural and erse society and we want to celebrate that.“Fair Saturday offers the perfect  to do that.”First staged in Bilbao in , the Fair Saturday movement is spearheaded by social entrepreneur Jordi Albareda.It has since been adopted by Malaga, Santander and Huelva in Spain, Milan and Pisa in Italy, Lima in Peru and Bristol in England.However, Scotland is the first nation to sign up.Jordi said: “When we began the Fair Saturday movement, we wanted countries all over the world to embrace its ideals of creating social impact through arts and culture. “It is fitting that Scotland is hosting the first nationwide Fair Saturday festival outside of Spain.“Scotland is a nation that focuses on ersity, multiculturalism, social empathy, kindness and, of course, arts and culture. “So it made complete sense for us to deliver the movement here. It is the most vibrant case of Fair Saturday to date.“In a time of building walls, we want to build bridges to connect people, cities, communities and cultures. “Millions of people working together surely must be stronger than some irresponsible global leaders.“We hope the Scottish people will mobilise behind our aim of creating a better future for all.”Some  events have already been organised in  cities and towns across Scotland on Fair Saturday, December .And the movement will also be celebrated in more than  locations globally.Jordi said: “More than  cultural events with a social impact will be taking place around the world.“Could you imagine the day when millions of people take part  It would send such a powerful message – that’s our aim for the future.”Fair Saturday aims to make people reflect on how arts and culture and social causes contribute to society. So all its events support a social cause of their choice in one of three ways:By recognising the charity’s workBy allowing the charity to spread its message to a wider audienceBy contributing to the charity’s work via ticket sales and donations.November  and December  in Scotland will also serve as a perfect antidote to Black Friday’s commercialism, which initially prompted Fair Saturday’s launch.Jordi added: “We connected with the Scottish Government thanks to our British Council in Bilbao in late  and are delighted to launch our first Fair Saturday here this year.“We believe it is one of the best nations in the world in which to start the journey. “Scotland’s National Day is all about sharing, giving and being kind. That tells you a lot about its people.”Visit www.scotland.org events st-andrews-day makesomeonesday to find out more or share your good deed at #MakeSomeonesDay.Fair fight back against Black FridayFair Saturday aims to mobilise people through social empathy rather than commercialisim – being staged the day after Black Friday to make that point.Jordi Albareda, its founder, convinced  choirs to perform in Bilbao, Spain, on November , , in dferent locations around the city at the same time. The result was incredible more than  people attended, raising more than  Euros for social causes.Since then, the movement has continued to grow, with more cities, cultural and social organisations and supporters joining along the way.Jordi said: “We are living in a material world. It prevails over humanity. “The strong desire of having has taken over from the profound aspiration of being. But living to the fullest is mostly about love. “In the last hours of our lives we won’t remember the things we owned but rather the people we loved.“Black Friday is one of the most irrational days of the year strong proof of a growing materialist system, based on the short term and unsustainable. “We do not pretend to fight against Black Friday but we do offer a positive alternative.“It’s all about culture before materialism. Social empathy before greed. “It’s a day to be better following a day to have more.”As for the future, Jordi hopes to target one of the world’s largest commercial markets – America.He added: “We are already taking the first steps to develop the movement in the USA in  and we’re expecting more European cities to get involved too.“Black Friday may be popular but surely Fair Saturday makes more sense.”To support Fair Saturday and find out about events in your area, visit the website at https:app.fairsaturday.org.

Every year I am bowled over by how much the campaign means to families in need throughout the City and Shire.“Applications have soared in recent years and we have been overwhelmed by the generosity of the public in allowing us to address the demand. “This year we are expecting more requests for help than ever before but we are confident that the generous people of the North-east will give what they can to bring the joy of Christmas to families in their communities.”Donations will be accepted at more than  drop-off points.

A recent survey revealed that one in five people had not heard of credit unions, and only two-fths of those questioned thought they would be eligible to be a member of a credit union. The survey also found that one in four people wrongly believed that credit unions make profits for shareholders, just like banks.The campaign – ‘People, Not Profit’ – aims to highlight that credit unions are not-for-profit organisations, providing loans and savings, and that most people living in Scotland would be eligible to join at least one credit union based on where they work or where they live. Aileen Campbell, Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Local Government, said: “In helping build a fairer Scotland, we want to protect people from getting into unmanageable debt and falling into the hands of predatory, high cost lenders.“A key part of this is making sure that people are aware of the financial services and fair alternatives available, including credit union membership.“Our new campaign will highlight the benefits of joining a credit union. I would encourage everyone to visit the new website to find out more.”Michael Sheen, actor and social activist, has worked with the Scottish Government to produce a short video explaining what a credit union is. He said: “I’m very pleased to be backing the ‘People, Not Profit’ campaign, and I share the Scottish Government’s ambition to grow and raise awareness of this sector. “I’m a member of a credit union myself, and so I know first-hand the benefits they offer. “What’s important to me is that they are owned by the people who actually use their services, and any profits that they make are invested back into the credit union.”A new website has been set up to support the ‘People, Not Profit’ campaign.

It will be replaced with a power-saving LED.Ally Rae, the lighthouse boards project leader, said: \"The new light will be more reliable and require less maintenance than the optic lamp and will make a signicant saving to running costs. This is only the third time weve been able to place an LED within the existing rotating lens.

These concerns were echoed by the group of experts giving evidence to the Committee this morning.Speaking after the committee meeting, Mr McArthur said: “Today’s evidence session left no doubt at all that the Scottish Government is now isolated over its approach to tackle fuel poverty in rural and island areas. It is increasingly clear that Ministers will have to think again and ensure their proposals are properly #island proofed#.“In a desperate move yesterday evening, the Housing Minister issued a briefing to MSPs seeking to justy his decision not to include a rural Minimum Income Standard in the revised definition of rural fuel poverty.  This attempt by the Minister to get his retaliation in first backfired, however, as the Committee heard again today how this approach flies in the face of all the advice.“The Rural Fuel Poverty Task Force, the government’s own Independent Panel of Advisers and every organisation across the Highlands  Islands involved in housing and fuel poverty have made plain that excluding a rural MIS risks support not going to the people and communities who need it. As a result, the government’s own targets for combatting fuel poverty across the country will be undermined.“While fuel poverty is not simply an island issue, all the evidence shows that it affects rural and island communities more than others. Hopefully, today’s committee evidence session will persuade ministers to think again. If not, it will be up to parliament to force the government to do the right thing”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There are a number of potential routes we could now take with them – some of which offer us the opportunity to generate income, some to make savings # and officers will be exploring these opportunities in due course.”According to OIC, the Stewart Endowment Trust disperses the majority of its funds locally, including to NHS Orkney. The council therefore anticipates that most of the money generated from the sale will stay in and benefit Orkney.Iain Macdonald, chair of the Stewart Endowment Trust said: “The Stewart Endowment Trustees offered these islands for sale in order to generate funds, which are used to support the work of local congregations, the Balfour Hospital and a couple of national charities, as defined by the Endowment’s founding document.#We are delighted that they will be moving into ship of the local authority, where they will remain a precious asset for the whole community for generations to come.”The main island, Faray is around  acres, the Holm of Faray around  acres and the smallest of the three, Red Holm, is just five acres.There are a number of ruinous dwelling houses scattered across Faray together with a bothy which is housed in the former school.

Mossa-Rahmani said that its assets would be “better placed in the bosom” of DNO, which is Norway’s oldest independent oil and gas company.The offer comes on the back of weaker oil prices in recent weeks. The price of Brent crude has tumbled since hitting a four-year high in September, with a barrel trading at  on Monday morning.Analysts at BMO said the offer of p per share was below their valuation of p per share.“DNO’s bid looks opportunistic, coming on the back of recent weakness in commodity markets,” they said.“Faroe’s strong balance sheet and growth trajectory means it is relatively well insulated against short-term oil price moves.”This was echoed by Cantor Fitzgerald, who said: “While DNO’s signicant existing stake may make a takeover now appear ultimately inevitable, in our view investors would be ill-advised to accept what is clearly a “low-ball” offer.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4835049.1543241657!/image/image.jpg","title":"catherine stihler countdown to brexit should be stopped before it blows up in our faces","story":"Today, in Luxembourg, the European Court of Justice will meet to hear the case for halting the disastrous Brexit process. This day has been a long time coming the culmination of a legal battle that has rumbled on for almost a year.Can Westminster unilaterally stop the Article  ticking clock which was triggered by Theresa May in March , and is set to chime in March next year After hearing the case today, the ECJ will retire to consider a verdict – and we’ll be told the answer in the coming weeks.The case was brought by a cross-party group of Scottish politicians, including me and my Labour MEP colleague David Martin. The team also includes Green MSP Andy Wightman, who has been leading from the front, as well as his ­colleague Ross Greer, SNP MEP Alyn Smith and SNP MP Joanna Cherry.Throughout the process we have been backed by Jolyon Maugham QC of the Good Law Project, and we’re incredibly grateful for the ­support we have received from all those who donated to the crowdfunding appeal.Legal cases like this don’t come cheap. But this is not some publicity stunt or futile endeavour – it’s a vital test to find outwe can call a halt to the Brexit catastrophe.Everyone involved in this fight campaigned hard against Brexit in the  referendum. We knew that leaving the EU would cost jobs, stle economic growth and put workers’ rights at risk.When we need solidarity between nations more than ever, breaking away from this unique partnership was never going to be the best choice for our country.But we lost the contest ­following a referendum where the Leave campaign lied and cheated, ­peddling myths about NHS funding and scaremongering about immigration.In the immediate aftermath of that vote, there was a need for calm and cool heads. I still shudder when recalling how Jeremy Corbyn – a lelong Eurosceptic – said we should immediately trigger Article  the following morning.The Prime Minister took a bit more time and pressed the button on March , . But she did so without any knowledge of what the Brexit deal would look like.There had been no negotiations with EU member states no agreement within her Cabinet. She started the two-year clock ticking without a clue about what she could achieve. It was an utterly reckless decision by a Prime Minister which generations of history students will learn about for decades to come.The UK Tory government gave the impression that that was it: the ­decision was final.But Lord Kerr, the author of the Article  notice, has said the ­Government can withdraw its letter and stop the processit wishes to.Jean-Claude Piris, the former head of the European Council’s legal service, has also said: “Article  is based on the principle that withdrawing from the EU is a unilateral decision. Nobody can force a state to leave.”So we lodged papers in the ­Scottish courts, seeking a ruling from the national court to the ECJ for a definitive ruling – bearing in mind that the Article  process has never been used before.Our first attempt failed – a Court of Session judge initially felt the issue was hypothetical as the UK Government had stated it did not intend to halt the process.But our appeal was successful, as Scotland’s most senior judge, Lord Carloway, determined it was clear – in terms of the European UnionAct – that MPs will be required to vote on whether to raty the Brexit deal.It is neither academic nor ­premature to ask whether it is ­legally competent to revoke the Article  notication.The Court of Session sent a ­reference to the ECJ seeking a ­ruling, but the UK Government – in an act of sheer desperation – lodged an appeal at the Supreme Court in London. This was quickly dismissed, as the court confirmed it is the ECJ which “must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision”.So that is how we have got to today.Since the legal process began, “Chequers” has come and gone, and the Prime Minister’s worst-of-all-worlds deal was agreed by the EU at the weekend.It’s a bad deal for the economy with no guarantee of frictionless trade in the future it’s a bad deal for workers with no guarantees that Britain will keep EU standards on workers’ rights and it’s a bad deal for ­consumers with no guarantees on continued consumer rights.The end of free movement will be harmful for economic growth here at home, but also for young people who will be denied the opportunity to travel, work, live, love and explore throughout the whole of the EU. It’s a deal which should be voted down by MPs in the Commons.I very much hope the Luxembourg verdict is known before that meaningful vote takes place in ­Parliament. MPs should await the outcome, as a positive verdict would give them the option of pausing Brexit – not just picking between the dreadful choice of Mrs May’s deal or no-deal.I am confident this alternative will be available. We must hold our nerve. We owe it to every voter in the UK to ensure that all avenues are fully explored.Why are we running headlong towards this fork in the road where the signposts are ‘deal’ or ‘no deal’  Let’s pause before we reach the fork and reconsider our options.Or – even better – let’s build an alternative path that’s signposted ‘people’s vote’. On this route we can put control back in the hands of the public – and let them decidethis Brexit chaos is really worth it.Catherine Stihler is a Labour MEP for Scotland.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4835216.1543261512!/image/image.jpg","title":"euan mcgrory david attenborough s dynasties is mawkish and overcooked","story":"Halfway through Sir David Attenborough#s last series I thought we didn#t love him enough. Blue Planet II won a monster audience but it seemed we were getting complacent and beginning to take these seminal, sensory-overload blockbusters for granted.I didn’t end up writing that piece in praise of him but wish I had because now I find myself cooling on these animal epics. I mean, Attenborough is still a national treasure. He’s still grandad to us all. He’s still the greater pale-blue-shirted warbler on the subject of the natural world. And he’s still the grumpy fellow I interviewed a few years ago, harrumphing at a perfectly innocent enquiry about his thespian brother Dickie. The problem is with his current show, Dynasties.The problem might just be mine. You lot seem to love Dynasties, crying yourselves to sleep every Sunday night at the heart-rending tales from the Arctic tundra and the savanna wilderness. Me, I think I might be turning in a cynic with a hide as tough as that of the exceedingly fat-bottomed hippo which this week refused to become lunch for a ravenous lion.Lions were the focus of the latest programme which was interesting for turning the whole kings-of-the-jungle legend on its head and showing a Masai Mara lioness with a ten-strong pride at risk from hyenas and farmers who lay down poison. But it told its story like televised drama.You knew when the cubs were under threat because suddenly there would be a blast of mawkish muzak. If I was a cub I might prefer to take my chances with the hyenas rather than the overbearing and over-sentimental BBC soundtrack department. But I am not a cub and lions are not humans.More and more, though, nature shows are resembling dramas in their construction, and especially the soapier kind. Dramas must contain a sufficient amount of sex and death, laughter and tears. The narrative must toy with our emotions with a carefully-controlled ebb and flow. All of this is scripted it has to be. Dramas are heightened reality because reality in its unnished state can be supremely dull. My le is tedious and I bet yours is even worse. But nature shows are supposed to be factual.Watching the most recent episode of Dynasties and the moments of face-licking tenderness within the pride, I couldn’t help wonderingthese happened right on cue, or whether the film was re-ordered later in the editing suite to induce the desired collective tingle in the audience. I know what you’re thinking: “What a ridiculous way to spend Sunday night!” Well, there’s an unfortunate history of nature programmes bending reality with polar bears in Dutch zoos standing in for the Arctic version and semi-domesticated wolves body-doubling for wild ones. Then there was the baby iguana vs racer snake outrage from Planet Earth II. This incredible chase sequence won a Bafta and was viewed by comedienne Ellen Degeneres as a symbol of hope after a racer snake got into the White House. “This baby iguana is all of us,” she tweeted. But then the producers admitted the scene had been stitched together from dferent bits of footage, adding: “Snakes and iguanas aren’t very good at ‘takes’.”So was this really an outrage - a “fakery storm”, in the words of one Beeb-bashing newspaper  Did you feel cheated  Perhaps not, and maybe you went away from that series with a greater understanding and appreciation of the animal world. But I repeat: animals are not humans. More and more of us are performers, evenwe’re not proper actors, for it can seem like we’re all queuing up backstage at a reality show to be asked formatted questions by Dermot O’Leary which never change and are specically intended to make us cry. Animals shouldn’t have to follow scripts. I mean, it’s not asthey’re performing seals .Ah yes, there’s been a lot of blubbing over Dynasties. On Sunday the lioness was forced to leave behind a sick cub for the sake of the rest of the pride. The previous week Emperor penguins in Antarctica were blown into an icy ravine and when a chick couldn’t climb out it was left by its mother, seemingly to perish - until the film crew decided to dig steps in the gully walls.Maybe you cried at these scenes accompanied by Attenborough’s tremulous, portentous delivery - or maybe you cried when the production team cried at the end of both episodes. The intervention in Antarctica has been much-debated - shouldn’t nature be allowed to take it course, however grim  - but personally I’m more bothered by the intervention of the cameramen during the last ten minutes of nature programmes to tell us how they got all the shots. There’s great skill involved, I don’t doubt that, and the best will be rewarded when the telly awards are handed out. But there’s skill in all technical work and, for instance, we never heard from the cameraman on Bodyguard who could have reasonably claimed: “How I made British politics more interesting and got you all lusting after the Home Secretary.”The BBC, of course, likes to blow its own trumpet. These inserts are also evidence that everyone’s a star these days or thinks they are. Even cameramen are playing to the camera. But maybe the problem with Dynasties is that it was designed as a smaller work compared with the Blue Planets and Planet Earths and, impatient for the next super-series, the Beeb have overcooked it. There’s a more sizable problem to come for the Corporation, however: that super-series will be on Netflix. The big beast of animal TV is reaching for the higher, more luscious branches where the rewards are greater.

That looks dficult to achieve, writes Paris GourtsoyannisUntil now, it’s been easy to dismiss the debate over fishing after Brexit as a parochial one.The industry makes up less than half a percent of UK GDP. Fishing interests are concentrated in a small number of communities, so the issue is wrapped up in retail politics. Because fishing disproportionately affects Scotland – six of the ten biggest ports for fish landings are north of the Border – any discussion has long since been colonised by the bigger constitutional debate. The UK was barely in the door of the EU when that happened.Well, fishing isn’t a local issue anymore. It’s not even merely a national concern.In fact, fishing is set to become the UK’s first international trade row of the post-Brexit era.Emmanuel Macron’s reasons for making it so might have little to do with fishing. The French President is confronting his toughest ever challenge as he tries to face down protesters causing chaos over a hike in fuel taxes. The demonstrations have turned deadly, and Macron may have tried to write a few headlines about a tough stand in Brussels in a vain attempt to distract from the anger of the ‘gilet jaune’ protests.Whatever his reasons, it was clear Macron was intent on making waves over fishing from the moment he turned up in Brussels for the EU Council summit. He used his TV clip on arrival to thank Michel Barnier for ensuring “reciprocal access” to fishing waters was part of the withdrawal deal and pledged that French fishermen would be “well defended” in trade talks to come.• : Brexit: Theresa May confirms date of meaningful voteHe wasn’t alone: Denmark, Germany Belgium, Ireland and Spain all have a stake in ensuring their fishing fleets can continue to access the UK’s waters after Brexit, and the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte reflected that in his own comments.“We have a big interest here, but also so does the UK to maintain market access to the EU for products coming out of UK waters,” he said, trying to sell the UK on something it really doesn’t want to do. The strength of that coalition was reflected in the minutes of the discussion the EU held before Theresa May came in the room: that a UK-EU fishing deal “should be built on... existing reciprocal access and quota shares”.In the concluding press conference a few hours later, Macron was asked what kind of leverage he had to make that happen. The French President pushed the red button and sent a Trident nuclear weapon shooting out of the waters of the North Sea:that fisheries deal isn’t done by the time the transition period ends, the EU will trigger the backstop intended to prevent a hard border in Ireland. The effect would be to keep the UK stuck in the customs union against its will.• : “I can’t imagine that the desire of Theresa May or her supporters is to remain for the long term in a customs union,” Macron said himself, barely disguising the threat and ruthlessly making it about the Prime Minister’s own political position. Because, unlike the withdrawal agreement, a trade deal must be approved unanimously, Macron has that leverage.Don’t be surprised at the power plays and the personal attacks. Fishing is fertile water for conflict. The UK and EU have overlapping interests: European fishermen, who catch two-thirds of the fish pulled out of British waters, make their living in the seas around the UK. British fishermen, meanwhile, make their living in the fish markets of Europe: it’s estimated that  per cent of the UK’s catch is exported, most of it to the continent.Moreover, it’s the UK fishermen who need frictionless access to the EU as much as any British industry. Their product is among the most perishable. A few months back I wrote about a Caithness shellfish producer who enthusiastically supported Brexit, but knocked on his MP’s door afterwards asking for a soft exit deal. If Scottish langoustines take an extra half day to clear customs at Boulogne, that market is finished. Both sides should want a deal, particularly as the fish British consumers like to eat – cod and haddock – are largely imported, while the fish Europeans prefer – herring and mackerel – are among the UK’s biggest exports. A breakdown in the fish trade will hit consumers and fishermen on all sides.It’s politics that stands in the way. The biggest indignity the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy imposed on British fishermen wasn’t the scrappage scheme , restrictive quotas or wasteful discards. It was the knowledge that others were often taking more out of their seas than they were.No-one believed more fervently that Brexit would make them and their community a winner than fishermen. It’s pretty clear what a win looks like Theresa May said it herself in a brief but telling comment: her deal would “deliver a bigger annual quota” for the UK.That’s what this row is about, and how the government will ultimately be judged by fishing interests. Not on the minutiae of the legal agreement between London and Brussels, whether it stands alone or is folded into a wider trade deal. But whether fishing communities feel like winners when the boats come back in.The problem is this: environmental groups say nearly half of the North Sea’s fish stocks continue to be overexploited, despite the central aim of the CFP being to prevent ecological and economic disaster. Even stocks that are recovering, like cod, are still at historic lows.Last year, the EU agreed to tough new measures under the CFP aimed at preventing overfishing by preventing quotas from exceeding levels regarded as sustainable by scientists. Those measures, which will undoubtedly be part of discussions about a new UK-EU fishing regime after Brexit, were welcomed by the Environment Secretary, Michael Gove – both a leading Brexiteer and someone who has rebuilt his political brand since  through his environmental credentials.British fishermen want a bigger share of the catch. European fishermen won’t accept a smaller share. Environmentalists say no-one can catch much more than they do now. Mathematically and politically, the two positions can’t be reconciled. The problem isn’t the deal: it’s that there really aren’t plenty more fish in the sea.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4835180.1543260552!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit snp say nicola sturgeon must join televised debate","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The SNP has written to bosses at Sky News calling for Scotland#s First Minister to be involved in any planned live televised Brexit debates.The party are demanding a more representative discussion, featuring more voices than just those of the Labour party and the Conservatives. window.twttr Keith Brown, the SNP’s Depute Leader, stated that in order to give people the chance to properly discuss and scrutinise “all of the options that are being put forward” – including the SNP’s position for the whole UK to maintain membership of the Customs Union and Single Market in order to protect jobs and the economy -

She will visit Scotland later this week.“My deal delivers for every corner of the UK and I will work hard to strengthen the bonds that unite us as we look ahead to our future outside of the EU,” Mrs May said, adding she had “fought to ensure that powers ing from the EU will be restored to the National Assembly for Wales, the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly”.Downing Street also stepped up the campaign in Parliament, writing to MPs with an explicit warning that voting against the deal could result in a second EU referendum that reverses Brexit. It was confirmed there will be five days of debate over two weeks, starting on  December.Yesterday the Prime Minister made her third Commons statement in less than a fortnight, bringing to nearly nine hours the amount of time she has spent facing largely hostile questions from MPs.: SNP say Nicola Sturgeon should join Brexit TV debateShe appealed to Brexiteers in her own party not to reject the deal, insisting that it “delivers for the British people”.But she found little support on her own benches, with nearly an hour passing before any MP spoke up in favour.In a worrying sign for Downing Street, the former defence secretary Michael Fallon, seen as a loyal figure, warned the deal was a “huge gamble” that traded away large amounts of sovereignty without any guarantee of a positive trade deal.Mrs May tried to tackle the source of Brexiteer anger head on, saying the UK would have crashed out of the EU unless it had accepted the Irish border backstop.“I do not pretend that either we or the EU are entirely happy with these arrangements,” she said. “But there is no alternative deal that honours our commitments to Northern Ireland which does not involve this insurance policy. And the EU would not have agreed any future partnership without it.”She added: “Put simply, there is no deal that comes without a backstop, and without a backstop there is no deal.”Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Commons would have “very little choice” but to reject Mrs May’s “botched” deal. He said: “There can be no doubt this deal would leave us with the worst of all worlds – no say over future rules and no certainty for the future.”He added: “Ploughing on is not stoic, it’s an act of national self-harm. Instead of threatening this House with a no-deal scenario of a no-Brexit scenario, the Prime Minister now needs to prepare a plan B.”There was evidence of another appeal for cross-party support when Mrs May said she was wrong for suggesting EU nationals had “jumped the queue” ahead of immigrants from other countries. She told the SNP’s Philippa Whitford: “I should not have used that language in that speech.”SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford had earlier attacked Mrs May over the comments, calling them a “slur” and telling the Commons the Brexit deal “blatantly disregards the rights that we will all lose to live and work in Europe. We are not prepared to give up those rights”.He also emphasised the SNP’s support for another referendum on EU membership.The Scottish Government will publish its analysis of the economic impact from Mrs May’s Brexit deal today.Constitutional relations secretary Michael Russell said it was now clear that MPs were being asked to vote on a “blindfold Brexit with major issues left unresolved”.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

stand-off.The breakthrough follows \"extremely positive and constructive\" high-level discussions between the hotel group and Highland Council.Local Highland High Leusers have been unable to use the leisure pool since the end of August when access ended because of a funding wrangle.Macdonald Hotels chairman Donald Macdonald and deputy chairman Gordon Fraser met with the councils new chief executive Donna Manson in Aviemore on Tuesday and reached a one-year agreement to resolve the stalemate.HLH users will not have to pay any additional charges which had been one of the options on the table as attempts were made to break the deadlock.There is further good news with confirmation that HLH swimming lessons for children and aquafit will also resume.Details of the funding arrangements have not yet been made public nor when the doors will re-open.Speaking after the meeting, Mr Fraser said: \"Were extremely encouraged by the positive and constructive approach taken by Donna Manson and her team and are very happy that we have reached an agreement which will see the local High Le Highland members enjoying the facilities at Aviemore Resort very soon.\"We understand that local authorities throughout the country are facing financial pressures and that there is a clear responsibility to spend tax-payers money wisely.\"We were also encouraged by the recognition of our own position that we have had to swallow a wide range of very signicant cost increases in rates, energy bills and staffing costs over the past  months.\"Mr Fraser continued: \"Its clear that both we and the council were very keen to welcome back local people and reach a clear and swt resolution to what has been an unfortunate situation for everyone concerned, and particularly for the many local High Le Highland members.\"For our part, we are very keen to have our local guests back through the doors, and I know that members of the local community will be happy that this matter has been resolved.\"The new agreement will allow time for further consultation on public access to the leisure facilities in future years.Highland Council convener Bill Lobban, who lives in Aviemore, said: \"I am delighted that a sensible agreement has been reached.\"This new deal is great news for Highland Council, High Le Highland and Macdonald Aviemore Resort but most importantly its fantastic news for the residents of Badenoch and Strathspey.\"The swimming pool is a well-used, important attraction and I would like to congratulate the staff from both sides who have worked really hard behind the scenes to get this result and more especially members of the local community who made sure that their voice was heard in the process.\"Well done to all.\"A positive community campaign had been launched called Save Our Swimming following the doors closing to HLH users at the end of the summer.SOS co-ordinator Joe Kirby described the agreement as a fantastic result for all the parties.He said: \"It is great that the council and Macdonald Hotels have listened to the concerns of the community and that a pragmaticto talks has delivered this deal.\"I know as a father myself that folk across the strath will be really looking forward to getting backing into the swimming pool with their children and other families members.\"Id like to thank everyone who wrote correspondence to Macdonald Hotels, attended the public meetings and demonstrations and who helped to fund the SOS  campaign.\"It all goes to show what can be achieve with a bit of community spirit.\"Judith Thurlow, chair of Aviemore Primary School parents council, was also absolutely delighted.\"This is a leline for so many members of our community and an essential skill for the local children to learn,\" she said.\"Thank you to everyone in the community who has persevered, shown great resilience and played a part in reaching this really positive outcome.\"Pupils from the school had written to Mr Macdonald imploring him to let them go swimming again and local GPs and aquafit users ndash some in their eighties ndash had also gone public with their health concerns.There had also been several peaceful protests at the resort by SOS  in the aftermath of the decision.The Strathy tried yesterday to contact the council and Macdonald Hotels for further information on the new funding arrangements and when the doors will actually re-open for HLH cardholders but there was no response.It is understood the hotel giant had initially in the spring asked for pound, in year one pound, in year two and pound, in

Highlands and Islands Enterprise who commissioned the report have described the findings as a starting point.But it appears that there would have to be very persuasive arguments to now veer from this set course.HIEs head of business development Susan Smith told the Strathy: \"This is the start of a long journey but at the centre of this needs to be the buy-in from stakeholders and the local community.\"Naturally an element of funding has to come from the public purse.\"There are large infrastructure funds for which this project may be eligible.\"Intriguingly she continued: \"Without setting hares racing it is prudent that we look at what alternative funding mechanisms might be available.\"I would put the option forward there may be a number of philanthropic investors out there who are passionate about Cairngorm who may with a sensible model and plan consider some form of philanthropic investment.\"Ms Smith would only add when pressed: \"We have a very loose expression of interest which suggest to us there may be the opportunity to do a bit more work to tease out whether this is an alternative strategy but there is absolutely no guarantee.\"On Coire na Ciste, she said the consultants found there was no business case to develop the area as campaigners and many ski visitors would like to see.The HIE boss said: \"They have come back quite unequivocally saying that it would not stack.\"They have looked at the two sites and said it is unsustainable as a second site until there is a capacity of  peopleor more using CairnGorm Mountain because facilities would have to be doubled up.\"This is the view of the experts and they have consulted widely and I have to take confidence in that... to deviate from these findings there would have to be a signicant rationale to do so.\"Ms Smith said the two new chairlts would replace some of the surface lts but was unable to say which ones.She said that their partners Highland Council, Cairngorms National Park Authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Enterprise Scotland were enthused and excited by the vision.She said: \"They believe that for the first time in many years this is a sensible approach for the way forward.\"She also said HIE wants to be much more inclusive working with the right community representatives.Ms Smith explained: \"It can not be a free for all. It has to be through proper and proportionate channels that we bring this forward.\"She said Natural Retreats is the operator and part of the journey and had bought into it.

not the pound.m which Councillor Bruce has claimed.\"HIE also acquired pound.m in preference shares.\"However, due in large part to delay, obfuscation and obstruction by the previous administration of Highland Council, planning permissions were still not able to be delivered after  frustrating years of trying.\"As a result, and to the intense dismay and signicant financial cost of the three partners involved, the scheme, which would have created hundreds of much-needed jobs locally in an area of the country which desperately needed them, was forced into administration.\"This obviously meant the loss of pound.m of public money, which was utterly lamentable and deeply regrettable, as well as millions of pounds of losses to the three partners involved, but it also delayed huge investment in the local economy.\"It was only because Macdonald Hotels had a rock-solid commitment to regenerating the resort that we reached an agreement with the administrators in June  which prevented it from closing down completely for a second time.\"Ironically, it was only after the administration process that Highland Council granted the planning permission which had been applied for  years previously and which two previous owners had walked away from during that time.\"There was nothing controversial within that planning permission and itrsquos no more than the design of the resort as it is today.\"Since then we have invested pound.m in transforming the infrastructure at Aviemore and are now the largest private-sector employer in the area, with hundreds of full and part time staff employed there and an annual wage bill of pound.m.\"\"Indeed, we estimate that the resort will have hosted over , overnight stays, including several international conferences ndash some of them with up to  delegates - in the current year, many of which will provide vital additional income to local bars, restaurants, shops and attractions.\"Gordon Fraser, deputy chairman of Macdonald Hotels  Resorts, said: \"It is, of course, right and proper that local politicians get involved in such important issues, but for Councillor Bruce to insist that we should simply swallow the enormous increases in rates, salaries and energy costs at Aviemore without seeking a reasonable increase in the amount we receive for allowing Highland High Le members to use private leisure facilities, is blatant double-standards.\"Itrsquos a bit rich for the council to increase our annual rates bill by . per cent in the year to March  and yet when we seek a modest uplt in charges to help us cover a small element of those and many other cost increases, one of the councilrsquos own officials described our request as lsquounaffordablersquo.\"Like us, many local businesses might consider their large rates increases to be lsquounaffordablersquo but we have no choice other than to pay them.\"Councillor Bruce should remember that we entered into this agreement, and were happy to do so, on the basis that it saved Highland Council from having to spend many millions on building their own swimming pool and leisure facilities locally.\"And he should also bear in mind that the annual sums we are discussing are far, far lower than those which Highland Council would face each year for running their own facilities.\"Despite the ill-judged intervention of Councillor Bruce, we have been encouraged by the constructive and helpful approach of other politicians and hope to meet with senior council officials in the very near future to resolve what has been a damaging and unnecessary episode.\"The sooner we can welcome High Le members back into Aviemore, the better, but it has to be on a sustainable and viable commercial basis.\"Councillor Bruce was unavailable for comment.He had asked: \"Given that HIE awarded an pound. million funding package to Macdonald Hotels to develop the Avie-more Resort ndash including the construction of the leisure arena in the early s ndash should Macdonald Hotels not allow High Le card members to use the swimming-poolfacility in view of the public funds they enjoyed and has this point been raised in negotiations rsquoHighland Council has said it remains open to restarting negotiations.Aviemore Primary School pupils recently wrote to Mr Macdonald asking for the pool to reopen and the schools parent council led by Judith Thurlow has also been part of the campaign.Tuesday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118344.jpg","title":"Its far from being the end of the line","story":"Tom Ramage\"IM nervous as heck!\" confessed Karen Blessington, as she prepared to launch her own railway line last Friday.\"I have never spoken in public in my whole le so please bear with me...\"The huge crowd certainly did that and they loved every minute of the occasion as the flag went up again at Grantown East exactly  years to the day it last went down.It had been quite a journey \"from sadness to joy\" as she put it, following those drastic Beeching cuts of the s.\"The Phoenix has risen from the ashes of a derelict brown site.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job.

Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers.

The pair of Sir Knights enjoyed their first mock battle between King William and King James, in their respective roles, during the summer.Craig, from Richhill, admits the Scarva showpiece is a particular personal highlight, having assumed such office.He said: “I enjoy the interaction and opportunity to meet other people. We were fortunate to have been invited by the outgoing Lord Mayor to launch the Thirteenth, and promote our official charity. It is very rewarding to walk in front of the banner at Scarva, after months of planning, seeing all the spectators and Sir Knights enjoying themselves, with preferably nice weather!”The project coordinator, who only recently got married, acknowledges the extra responsibility of preparing for one of the flagship events of the parading season.“There’s a lot of meetings! We liaise with ious stakeholders in order to make the day possible, which means a lot of evenings are taken up, especially the closer we get to July. I must admit, I didnt appreciate the work that goes into organising the event until I was elected into office. “The deputy master and I are only two cogs of the wheel though, as there is a dedicated team who work tirelessly, giving up their time without any hesitation to put on the best parade of the year. “However, when you hit the Demesne, and see the tens of thousands of people enjoying themselves, it makes it all worth it.” Craig maintains he and Andrew have a close bond, having a shared interest in sport, and more importantly both “wanting the best for the preceptory”.As for their partnership demystying the perception that the Royal Black is an “older man’s” organisation, Craig retorts: “Yes, I would say so. I know many of my friends are all active members throughout the organisation. For those that argue it is an old mans organisation, I would say, join, get involved and help change that perception.”Andrew, from Donaghmore, said he enjoyed holding office with the Scarva preceptory.“There are not many preceptories with a young leadership like RBP  but it’s important to have experience from the older members to guide us in our decisions and actions,” he said.Temperatures set to plummet tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“If the presence of Craig and myself encourages younger people to join the Institution, then that can only be a positive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"alanah is a real inspiration","story":"ALANAH McGlinchey tells this reporter that it has been “such a boost” to have been the recipient of Inspirational Secondary School Teacher at the recent Andersonstown News Inspirational Youth of the West gala ceremony held in the Devenish Complex.The Religion teacher who has been a familiar face among the halls and corridors of St Louise’s Comprehensive College since  also teaches a Year Nine form class who are still bringing in congratulatory cards and presents for the popular teacher.A graduate of St Mary’s University College, Alanah told the Andersonstown News that she felt “really proud of myself, of St Louise’s and for the pupils when I heard about the Inspirational Youth nomination”.“When it actually happened, that my name was read out on the night, it was just so nice. I am not doing the work here for the students to recognise me in that way, I teach because I love it but it was such a great boost. I came into the classroom so happy and delighted to share the news with the class,” she said.Alanah spoke of the importance of young teachers making their mark in the city especially with so many who are choosing to go across the water or travel further afield.“Loads of my friends have left and gone to Liverpool, places like Qatar. I’m very much a home bird, I love being here, teaching here but I ask myself the question what does going across to Liverpool to teach have that we don’t have here at home  How are we supposed to make young lives betterwe leave and take our skills where “There is a young teaching staff in the Religion department here and our big focus is very much on ethics, making the subject more relevant to the pupils’ lives, how do you live out your faith through action  The girls I teach are so kind, there is a real kindness about our pupils, they would offer you the food from their lunch boxes, they are just so, so caring. At the minute our ‘Mini Marillacs’ named after St Louise, are collecting for the homeless and I would put a big emphasis on helping those less fortunate and the girls would bring in hats, gloves, scarfs, toiletries which are then brought to the Legion of Mary for distribution.”“Our sixth years go up to St John’s residential home every Tuesday to make cups of tea, bring buns and biscuits for the elderly. I can see them from my window and it just makes me smile knowing they are going up and more importantly want to go up, you don’t have to police them,” she said.Alanah spoke warmly of the “community spirit” in St Louise’s and how “everybody knows everybody” as school le presents “always something new”.“This is a huge school but you know everyone in it. It’s like a wee family. There isn’t a day I don’t laugh in this school,” she said."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"football tops at coca cola plant causing division says local man","story":"A COCA-COLA worker has described working conditions at the multinational’s Lambeg plant as “intimidating and antagonising” for Catholic employees as breaches of the company’s policy on work clothing are on the rise.The man said that though the wearing of football tops is expressly banned, Rangers and Northern Ireland jerseys are routinely worn by members of staff with no action being taken. And he added that despite the fact that Remembrance Sunday was marked almost a fortnight ago, poppies are still being displayed by some staff – with some workers opting for the double-whammy of a banned football and the remembrance symbol.“Employees here are brazenly walking around in Rangers and Northern Ireland tops even though everybody knows the rules,” our source inside the factory said. “It’s not asCoca-Cola is a wee firm that employs two or three people in a shed. It’s a massive global company with strict rules in place to ensure harmony and equality and yet nothing is being done. People see other people wearing football tops and they think, ‘Oh, that’s allowed now.’ And the poppies are still around too as well as other symbols used by one side of the community. Sometimes they’re pinned to the banned jerseys.”The worker said that Catholic members of staff are disappointed by the lack of action by senior members of staff. He added that things would continue to get worse until existing policy is enforced.“Management have yet to do anything about it,” he said. No-one is even being talked to never mind disciplined for their actions.“Personally, I feel antagonised, intimidated and fearful working in a place that is allowing this to continue and I know others do too. This is a place of work and people should be able to come to work without being in fear or intimidated in this manner.”A spokesperson for Coca-Cola denied any knowledge of football shirts being worn in at the plant but pointed out that the wearing of poppies all year round is acceptable.“We are not aware of any recent instances of employees wearing football shirts at work. Doing so would be in contravention of our unorm and dress code policy. This follows the guidance of the NI Equality Commission which states that the wearing of football shirts has the potential to disrupt a good and harmonious working environment.“In line with the Commission’s guidance, we do not prohibit the wearing of a poppy at work.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"renowned west belfast artist to set out stall at culturlann","story":"PROLIFIC West Belfast painter and illustrator Tony Bell is set to unveil a personal retrospective exhibition entitled ‘Special People Special Places’ at the Cultúrlann on Thursday November .

These pressures have left many of our members on the verge of quitting their jobs. This is an intolerable situation for the NASUWT, we are committed to defending the rights of our members in this school and hope that a constructive engagement can begin soon with the employers to fully address the situation.”A spokesperson for the CCMS, which oversees St Patrick#s said: “CCMS fully appreciates the right of teachers to take industrial action. However, we do not believe that in this instance such action is either proportionate or warranted. It is our firm belief that the issues at the heart of this dispute can best be dealt with through an open and honest dialogue which seeks to provide balance to the concerns of both sides.“CCMS echoes the Board of Governors in its call for a suspension to the proposed industrial action in order to create the time and space for meaningful and respectful dialogue aimed at resolving the issues of concern and dispute.”"},{"url":null,"title":"may on mission to win support as she lands in northern ireland for brexit talks","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

My deal delivers for every corner of the UK and I will work hard to strengthen the bonds that unite us as we look ahead to our future outside of the EU.\"Throughout negotiations, I have fought to ensure that powers ing from the EU will be restored to the National Assembly for Wales, the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly.\"In a direct appeal to farmers, she said the industry \"deserves better\" than the existing Common Agricultural Policyframework set out by the EU.\"After we leave the CAP we will be free to design a new policy that works for agricultural producers in all four nations and we are taking that work forward,\" she said last night.Turning to the issue of the Irish border, Mrs May said it had been \"at the forefront\" of her mind throughout negotiations.She said the deal \"avoids a hard border\" in Ireland, and gives \"unfettered access\" to the rest of the UK.But last night, Mrs May was dealt a major blow after US President Donald Trump said it may harm trade with America.Mr Trump said that he wanted the Prime Minister to \"do something\" about the agreement to ensure the UK can trade with the US more freely.Referring to the Brexit agreement, Mr Trump told reporters: \"Sounds like a great deal for the EU.\"I think we have to take a look at, seriously, whether or not the UK is allowed to trade.\"Because, you know, right now,you look at the deal, they may not be able to trade with us. And that wouldnt be a good thing.\"I dont think they meant that.\"I dont think that the Prime Minister meant that. And, hopefully, shell be able to do something about that.\"Earlier, the PM received a largely hostile reception as she told the Commons her Brexit deal \"delivers for the British people\", and warned that rejecting it would put the UK on the path to ision and uncertainty.She was loudly barracked by MPs as she insisted no better deal was available than the Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration on future relations endorsed by EU leaders in Brussels on Sunday. Former minister Mark Francois branded her deal a \"surrender\" and said opposition from Eurosceptic Tories and the DUP meant it was already \"dead as a Dodo\".On the backstop, the Prime Minister told MPs: \"First, this is an insurance policy that no-one wants to use. Both the UK and the EU are fully committed to having our future relationship in place by st January .\"And the Withdrawal Agreement has a legal duty on both sides to use best endeavours to avoid the backstop ever coming into force.\"If, despite this, the future relationship is not ready by the end of , we would not be forced to use the backstop. We would have a clear choice between the backstop or a short extension to the Implementation Period. If we did choose the backstop, the legal text is clear that it should be temporary and that the Article  legal base cannot provide for a permanent relationship.\"Mrs May added: \"Furthermore, as a result of the changes we have negotiated, the legal text is now also clear that once the backstop has been superseded, it shall cease to apply. Soa future Parliament decided to then move from an initially deep trade relationship to a looser one, the backstop could not .\"I do not pretend that either we or the EU are entirely happy with these arrangements. And thats how it must be were either party entirely happy, that party would have no incentive to move on to the future relationship.\"But there is no alternative deal that honours our commitments to Northern Ireland which does not involve this insurance policy. And the EU would not have agreed any future partnership without it. Put simply, there is no deal that comes without a backstop, and without a backstop there is no deal.\""},{"url":null,"title":"mps to vote on theresa mays brexit deal before christmas","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Furthermore, few predicted that one of the biggest threats to the deal would eventually come from Brexiteer MPs when, in the early stages of the negotiations, Remain campaigners took the Government to the highest court in the land in order to secure a meaningful vote for MPs.

The vote is expected to take place before MPs break for Christmas in December.Eurosceptic rejection\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Boris Johnson speaking during the DUP annual conference in Belfast Led by figures including Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, a swathe of Brexiteer Tories have rejected Mrs May’s deal and called for it to be renegotiated. This raises the prospect of some of Mrs May’s own MPs voting against the agreement when it goes before the Commons. Appearing at the DUP conference on Saturday, Mr Johnson said the deal will leave the UK a “satellite state” of the EU. In the Sunday Express Mr Rees-Mogg said the deal “does not deliver” on Brexit and “instead of taking back control, in some areas it will leave the United Kingdom with even less control than it currently has: the vassal state”.DUP oppositionLIVE: Watch Rt Hon Arlene Foster MLA - Party Leader’s Address at the #DUP Party Conference in Belfast  https:w… https:t.co yhGYiTEN— DUPNovember , The Eurosceptics’ rejection of the plans stems in large part from the deal’s backstop provision for the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Hardline Brexiteers say it risks the UK being unable to ever fully leave the EU. The DUP say the backstop would see Northern Ireland adopt a dferent regulatory regime to Great Britaina wider UK EU trade deal fails to materialise.

Ronnie Armour: Report demonstrates we are on the right path and doing the right things The inspectors said: \"We rarely see a prison make the sort of progress evident at Maghaberry and it is to the credit of all those involved that many of the outcomes for the men held at the prison are now among the best we have seen in this type of prison in recent years.\"Levels of violence and disorder had reduced signicantly and the prison was much more stable and calm, while relations between staff and prisoners had been \"transformed\".Areas where inmates congregate were once no-go zones for staff but are now regularly patrolled.Reservations remain over the handling of vulnerable prisoners, the inspectors said.Five inmates have killed themselves since the last inspection and a \"very high\"  reports of prisoners at risk had been opened recently.Observation cells for inmates vulnerable to self-harm had been used  times and strip clothing, designed to be resistant to suicide bids, in % of cases, which inspectors noted can add to distress.The unannounced inspection was conducted by Criminal Justice Inspection Northern Ireland, HM Inspectorate of Prisons, the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority and the Education Training Inspectorate.It said the regime inside was much better than observed previously and was being delivered reliably.It also said learning, skills and the provision of work had improved but much more still needed to be done.The inspectors said rehabilitation and release planning work was amongst the best they had seen.Prisoners received good support on arrival, a special area is set aside for the first few days with arrangements for mentoring by other prisoners and enhanced contact with family and friends, and the prison seemed safer, with a relatively low level of violence, but many men still said they felt unsafe, the report said. Robust and effective action had been taken to reduce the supply of illegal drugs.Some men spent long periods in a special care and supervision unit but more was being done to integrate them, inspectors said.Levels of self-harm had fallen, but management arrangements were too risk-averse, which can mean over-reliance on intrusive monitoring which can itself be stressful, and the underlying issues were not addressed adequately, the review found. The report also said that response to recommendations following deaths in custody was \"insufficient\".At the time of inspection there had been five self-inflicted deaths since a previous inspection in .Living conditions were reasonable, although some \"houses\" offered poor cell accommodation, the inspectors said.A new block is being opened soon.A more conducive environment for training and learning was created but inspectors said not enough activity places existed and the curriculum was too narrow.The report made  recommendations surrounding the negative perceptions held by many prisoners, the need for timely responses to health complaints and poorer outcomes seen by Catholic inmates.It said the practice of supplying medicines which had been prescribed for direct administration by prison staff should be reviewed to reduce the opportunity for bullying by other prisoners."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland foodbanks braced for christmas rush as they face busiest month","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The third highest was Londonderry at , .Fth highest was Tyrone with  adults and  children, a total of , while the lowest was Fermanagh with a total of  foodbank users .Across the UK the Trussell Trust provided , three-day emergency food supplies to people in crisis last December - , of which were distributed to children.According to its latest statistics, this is a % increase on the - monthly average. The trust said its latest figures reveal that the need for foodbanks in December is rising steeply, with it recording a % increase across the UK from December  compared to the same month last year.The Trussell Trust has warned that it anticipates the need will be even greater this year due to the introduction of the Universal Credit benefit system which finishes its phased introduction here next month.This system has resulted in people waiting a \"minimum of five weeks\" for their first payment, and has \"only made matters worse\", according to the charity. It also cites the \"inability of benefit levels to cover essential living costs\", and issues with payments as remaining the most common reasons for foodbank referrals. The issue has prompted Trussell Trust chief executive Emma Revie to urge supporters to donate food items as early as possible in December to help alleviate pressure ahead of the festive period.\"Christmas is supposed to be a time for joy but what were seeing is the festive period becoming increasingly stressful for more and more people across the country,\" she said. \"Our benefits system is supposed protect us all from being swept into poverty - but what were seeing is people struggling to heat homes and put food on the table because they simply cannot afford the basics anymore and that just isnt right.\"The chief executive added: \"Ultimately, its unacceptable that anyone should have to use a foodbank in the first place. \"We do not want to be here in the long-term, continuing to pick up the pieces. \"Thats why were urging the Government to ensure benefits payments reflect the cost of living and reduce the waiting time for Universal Credit to help ensure we are all anchored from poverty.\"To find out more please visit: www.trusselltrust.org get-help  find-a-foodban the number of people in Northern Ireland who used foodbanks here in December "},{"url":null,"title":"northern trust and trackars give their response","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The leading architect revealed he had received more than a dozen unsolicited emails from engineers and geologists inquiring about the project since the speech on Saturday. “It has been bubbling along since January,” said Professor Dunlop. “I thought that was the end of it, and then something  happens.“And then with Boris Johnson, Karen Bradley and the DUP bringing it up again, it just seems like a potential story and narrative which keeps moving on.”Last week the bridge was raised during a discussion in the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee in Westminster. Responding to a question from the DUP’s Ian Paisley, Secretary of State Karen Bradley said she was willing to have a discussion about commissioning a feasibility study on the bridge, but noted there were issues around the sea bed and the current site of the proposed bridge link. Addressing the DUP annual conference on Saturday, former foreign secretary Mr Johnson said proposals for a bridge link were being held back by the “absence of political will”. “I think that there will be a feasibility study, which is all I can ask for. That’s all I’ve ever asked for,” said Professor Dunlop.“I am not suggesting for a moment it is going to be a walk in the park. Instead people providing opinions about whether it can be done or not, it would be good to actually get the facts.”Boris Johnson backs bridge linking Northern Ireland and ScotlandSDLP MLA criticises Paisley for obsessing over Northern Ireland to Scotland bridgeMr Johnson first expressed his support for a bridge back in June, when he called for the proposal to be taken “seriously”. Mr Dunlop first envisioned the idea for the bridge link after being asked to do so by a newspaper in Scotland. He laid out two proposals for the route — one from Larne and Portpatrick, potentially costing around £bn or a shorter crossing between the Mull of Kintyrne and Torr Head, which could cost between £bn and £bn.The proposal received a boost in March after a spokesman for the Scottish Government said it would “initiate discussions to explore improving connectivity” between the island of Ireland and Scotland, adding it was important “that all options are fully considered”."},{"url":null,"title":"varadkar calls on sinn fein to resign seats in westminster ahead of brexit vote","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Corbyn urges Theresa May against ploughing on given lack of Brexit deal support  Business leaders tell political parties no-deal Brexit would be ‘disastrous’  Varadkar meets Orange Order in Dublin amid Brexit negotiations However, the party is continuing its long-standing policy of abstention, whereby MPs refuse to actually take up their seats in parliament.Mr Varadkar said today that they should now change tact in order to help Ireland avoid a chaotic no-deal scenario.He described Mary Lou McDonald’s party as “unusual” because it “isn’t taking up its seats in Westminster for one reason and it isn’t taking up its seats in Stormont for another”.The Taoiseach said “generally” people get involved in politics because they want “to use the democratic process to get good outcomes for citizens”.Speaking at a ‘Project Ireland’ event in Dublin on Monday morning, Mr Varadkar went on to say thatSinn Fein feel they “got elected on the basis of abstentionist” then they “have the option now of resigning their seats and allowing people in those constituencies decide whether or not they want to have a say when this vote comes to Westminster”.“Bear in mind there are  MPs in Northern Ireland, eight of those  including Lady Sylvia Hermon are in support of what the UK government are proposing. But seven of those eight because of Sinn Fein aren’t going to show up.”Ms McDonald has previously defended the party’s decision not to take up the seats, saying her party will not “ride in on a white charger” to save the day.She warned that there could be unintended consequencesher party took up their seats.\" data-title\"Mary Lou McDonald \" \" title\"Mary Lou McDonald \" width\"\" \"\"  \" title\"Mary Lou McDonald \" width\"\" \"\"  Mary Lou McDonald Meanwhile, Mr Varadkar has said he expects UK politicians will have to accept the Brexit deal “sooner or later”.He said it is the “best deal” available and cannot be reopened just four months until the UK formally leaves the EU on March .Asked about contingency plans for a no-deal scenario, Mr Varadkar said they were ongoing.“We are preparing for two scenarios. One is call the central case scenario which is pretty much the deal that’s been done. The second is a hard Brexit, clf-edge, no-deal scenario.“In many ways, it’s the same thing, it’s just a graduated response upwards. We are making those preparations. But we need to be realistic here. There’s no country in the European Union that can be fully prepared for a clf-edge, no-deal Brexit. That’s why it makes sense to agree to this deal,” he said.In response to the comments, Ms McDonald said the Taoiseach “needs to catch himself on”.She said Sinn Fein has “no intention of standing aside and abandon our mandate”.“The reality is that the people of those constituencies have already spoken and they chose abstentionist Sinn Fein MPs.\"The Taoiseachs problem is that he doesnt like the democratic choice of the people of those constituencies and now makes the ludicrous proposition that there should be another election without Sinn Feins participation, taking the democratic choice away from the people.”Ms McDonald added thatFine Gael feels Irish politicians should take seats in the UK Parliament then “they should seek a mandate” and “stop hurling form the ditch”.“Fine Gael, and Fianna Fail for that matter, should put to the people their willingness to take seats in Westminster and to swearing an oath to a foreign power and let the people decide.”In a statement, the Sinn Fein leader said Leo Varadkar is the Taoiseach “who famously said the Nationalist people in the North will never again be left behind yet he is now advocating that we reject their democratic wishes”."},{"url":null,"title":"varadkar vows to build bridges not borders as he welcomes orangemen","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Two whales later died there.On Monday evening, crews transported the remaining animals on hay-lined trailers to Rarawa Beach on the opposite coast of the peninsula, where the sea conditions were calmer. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Rescuers stand with a pygmy killer whale The trip took about an hour, said Department of Conservation ranger Jamie Werner.Mr Werner said the whales were then placed in a tidal stream to relieve the pressure on their bodies. But he said the whales became too buoyant and were moved onto the sand, where volunteers kept a vigil through the night, regularly cooling the animals with water.Mr Werner said about  people showed up to help, and groups of a dozen per whale lted the animals into the sea on Tuesday morning and re-floated them on the high tide. He said that two of the weaker whales beached themselves again.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Rescuers attempt to refloat the whales “They were calling to the other whales in the pod, and they were coming back in,” he said. “So we made a quick decision to euthanise them. “It’s actually phenomenal to see how in tune they are with each other.”He said the remaining whales were swimming about  metres from the shoreline on Tuesday afternoon and would continue to be monitored until they swam into deeper water, their natural habitat.The crews were hoping for a better outcome than from an unrelated stranding over the weekend in which all  pilot whales died.Travel blogger Liz Carlson wrote that she was on a five-day hike on a remote part of Stewart Island when she and a friend found the pilot whales on Saturday evening. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Rescuers keep two pygmy killer whales wet She said they rushed into the water.“Desperately we grabbed their tails and pushed and yelled, before we got hammered by them thrashing around,” she wrote on Instagram. “It was useless, they were so big and heavy and the realisation we could do nothing to save them was the worst feeling I’ve ever experienced.”She said her friend ran nine miles to a hut to tell rangers and she stayed with the whales, dragging the smallest baby back into the water every few minutes before it would beach itself again.“I knew they would inevitable die,” she wrote. “I sank to my knees in the sand screaming in frustration and crying, with the sound of dozens of dying whales behind me, utterly alone.”When conservation workers arrived, they found that  of the animals were already dead and they decided to euthanise the others due to their poor condition and remote location.Whale strandings are relatively common in New Zealand during the Southern Hemisphere spring and summer. Scientists believe strandings can be caused by a number of factors, such as the whales trying to escape predators, falling ill, or navigating incorrectly."},{"url":null,"title":"new hotel set open derry march next year expand capacity additional","story":"A new hotel set to open in Derry next year is to expand its current capacity by  rooms, it has emerged.The new -bedroom Holiday Inn Express Hotel is currently under construction at the site of former Strand Bar and Flamin’ Jacks complex on the corner of Strand Road and Great James Street.It will create  new jobs once completed and boast a Marco Pierre New York Italian Restaurant, two meeting rooms and three retail units and will provide accommodation for up to , visitors a year.Speaking to the Derry News earlier this week, Brendan Duddy of the Duddy Group, the applicants behind the new development, said that it is hoped that the hotel will be operational by March .He added that the hotel would also be expanding its capacity to  bedrooms with the conversion of an existing floor at the top of the building.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshMr Duddy added that once opened, he hoped it would ‘transform’ the Strand Road area into a thriving hospitality hub.“We’re delighted to be extended the capacity, and we’ll be doing that through the conversion of what’s known as a ‘setback floor’, which will now be used for accommodation,” he said.“We’re currently looking at a March  opening date, and we’re excited about the impact this will have on the Strand Road area.“There’s been a lot of investment in that part of the town over the past years, there’s a great iety of places to eat and of course we’ve had Primrose really putting a lot of effort in.“Hopefully, we’ll also play our part in transforming the Strand Road and helping to increase footfall.”He added: “What you have to keep in mind is that every person who stays in Derry, spends in Derry, be that going out for a bite to eat, a drink, or taking a taxi somewhere, that is money which is pumped into the local economy and will not be lost to other areas.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein accuse inla turning derry housing estate ghetto","story":"Sinn Fein has accused the INLA of turning a housing estate in Derry into a ‘ghetto’ due to an upsurge in graffiti in the area which had come at the same time as a spate of recent attacks.The comments came at Thursday afternoon’s monthly meeting of Derry City and Strabane District Council, during a discussion on the setting up of a new task force to tackle ‘offensive’ graffiti.Speaking at the meeting, the Sinn Fein councillor Eric McGinley said that the appearance of INLA graffiti in the Ballymagroarty had coincided with a number of recent attacks in the area.“I would highlight the appearance of INLA graffiti in a number of areas, particularly in Ballymagroarty, and almost a parallel link in attacks on people and property in the estate,” he said.“There’s understandable speculation as to whether all that is linked, and many residents have been expressing concern recently as to why Ballymagroarty is being targeted.”He added: “Why is it happening, especially when you consider that the INLA declared a ceasefire in , announced an end to its armed campaign in  and decommissioned weaponry on .“The INLA, or the Irish Republican Socialist Party , some of whose members might be in this chamber, actually explain to the residents of Ballymagroarty, why the area they’re living in is turning into a ghetto ”He then called on all councillors who represent the Foyleside ward to join him in a ‘unied’ call for an end to the attacks, the removal of the graffiti which he said is ‘blighting’ the Ballymagroarty estate.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“We believe that call will let the Ballymagroarty community know that we share their concerns and that we will do all we can to improve their quality of le,” he added.The independent councillor Darren O’Reilly, who represents the Foyleside area, said he would like to ‘update’ Cllr McGinley that he had working with youth groups and the Education Authorityon the issue of political graffiti.‘Masked men’He continued that it was ‘important’ not to ‘demonise’ the young people who may be involved iN such activity and ‘work with them’.Meanwhile, the independent councillor Warren Robinson added that he wished to echo Cllr O’Reilly’s sentiments.“To sit on your high horse and condemn will not sort the issue out, and as elected representatives we have a responsibility to the young people who are doing this to engage with them,” he said. “I would agree that some of this graffiti is unsightly and should be removed,” he continued, before adding that community activists were already involved in these discussions.The independent councillor Paul Gallagher said that Cllr McGinley had been ‘very selective’ and said we ‘could also talk about masked men running about the Bogside for the benefit of tourists’, while the independent councillor Gary Donnelly accused Sinn Fein of engaging in ‘political point-scoring’."},{"url":null,"title":"visiting tangent clubs luminary on hand to switch on llandrindod wells christmas

I hope new hotel investment, which would provide the local economy with a signicant boost, can be realised, he added.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the council undertook a study to review hotel provision across the district and identied additional need specically within the Newcastle area.ldquoThe council has carried out an initial feasibility study on the Newcastle Centre site which identied that a hotel could be built on the site. General discussions have subsequently taken place with a number of potential developers about hotel provision in the Newcastle area,rsquorsquo he continued.ldquoThe council is also currently working with a consultant on the feasibility study for leisure provision in the Newcastle area and it is anticipated that a report will be presented to the Active and Healthy Communities Committee in the coming months..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan wildlife activist recognised by Prime Minster  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN teenager has been recognised by Prime Minister Theresa May for urging young people to protect the environment.Fourteen year-old Dara McAnulty is one of the latest recipients of the the Points of Light award, which recognises outstanding volunteers who are making a change in their community and inspiring others.He was presented with his award at an event held at Kew Gardens in London last week.Mrs May wrote to Dara congratulating him on his achievement.ldquoThrough your award-winning blog, you are encouraging young people to support their local environment and learn about the importance of conservation, she said.ldquoYour writing is raising awareness of how nature can help people cope with autism and you should feel proud of this remarkable achievement.Dara has been a driving force behind the Grassroots Challenge run by Ulster Wildle.In his blog he encourages other people his age to make videos of the out-doors and at the same time participate in conservation.Dara, who is autistic, says he is inspired by the beauty of the Mourne countryside on his doorstep and that developing a connection with nature helps him manage his anxiety.This in turn helped him to open the door for other people his age to become conservation enthusiasts too.Dara said: ldquoI am honoured to receive the Points of Light award. I sincerely hope that it shines a light on how vital nature is to us all, our mental health, our wellbeing and the survival of all le.ldquoWe need more young voices to speak up and take action for nature though.

The players ran their socks off and there was plenty of commitment. The tackling was hard, but fair, and it was a credit to the spirit in which the tie was played that not a single player was yellow-carded.The first half chance of the match fell to nippy YM striker Aaron Cheevers, who was almost through on goal, but was thwarted when Connolly came quickly off his line to save.Jack Roddy then headed narrowly over for Olympic and not long afterwards Olympic were awarded a free kick outside the box following Richard Annettrsquos challenge on Shane Rodgers. Unfortunately, Darryl Russell shot tamely against the wall.The best chance of the half fell to Olympic just after the half hour. Following a corner Gary Wilsonrsquos shot was cleared off the line and Roddy blazed over the bar.Cheevers was always a threat up front for the YM. On  minutes he was clean through, but again Connolly came out to thwart the danger. On  minutes he came within inches of putting his head on a cross by the impressive Wilson and just before the break his flicked header were narrowly wide.Ten minutes into the second half Olympicrsquos Simon Marmion found Joshua Fennell with a long pass, only for Fennell to shoot over from outside the penalty area on the right side.Four minutes later Damian Travers found himself with space in the box, but his left-footed shot was easilysaved by Connolly.On  minutes YMrsquos Sam Annett let fly, but his shot took a deflection off an Olympic defender for a corner.Both sides made a number of changes to break the deadlock and with five minutes to go YM substitute James Croskery shot low and hard, but straight at Connolly.The breakthrough nearly came moments later when Wilson delivered a dangerous free kick into the YM box, but Adam McDowell and Lee Maxwell couldnrsquot get a touch.In the first period of extra time, Rhys Patterson thought he had won it for Olympic, but Tate pulled off a great save.Just at the end of the second period Ronnie Johnston shot inches wide for YM after a good cross from the left by Adam McDowell.But the goals didnrsquot come and in the end it was all down to a penalty shoot-out. Olympic deserved to win, but it was cruel on the Young Men.Ballynahinch Olympic II: R Connolly, J Roddy, D Russell, N McGlew, M Rice, S Marmion, J Fennell, G Wilson, R Patterson, D Travers, S Rodgers.

The problems of vandalism and high running costs have made it virtually impossible to keep going any longer.Crisis points are no strangers to the harassed members of the hall committee. Two years ago they ran into trouble when funds for the hall completely petered out.The hall fell into an appalling state of disrepair and a public appeal to raise pound, was launched. Only pound, was raised and since then the management committee have an uphill battle to survive.While the hall belongs to the community and is run by a committee appointed at public meetings, the nature of the trust deed, under which it is held, means that it cannot be taken over or run by the district council.The hallrsquos usefulness became redundant as the old style of social s was replaced by nights out at licensed restaurants and by public house entertainment.Mrs Katie Williams, the committee treasurer, said: ldquoAlthough we still have money problems, the main thing we have to break down is apathy among the townspeople.

If anyone sees a route we have missed, please lest us know.Maurice added: ldquoWe hope that future editions can both improve the content and mapping of North Lecale and cover the Lecale coastline all the way to Dundrum Bay.ldquoThe book would make a wonderful Christmas present for anyone who loves Lecale or anyone with relatives aboard this Christmas who want to be reminded of the beautul Barony of Lecale and the local history of each parish. We have fully funded this publication so every book sold goes to develop local community walking routes and it will be available in most local shops.Cllr Enright said he was grateful for the knowledge and support he had received from older people ldquosteeped in folklore from every village and townland over the past year in producing the book as well as the invaluable technical expertise of his co-author Duane.ldquoPeople like Terry Swail, from Kilclief, Portaferryrsquos Lennie Lawson and Vincie Curran, from Myra, gave their time freely and ungrudgingly to make this publication such a success, he said.Councillor Enright said the book emerged from the process of developing village plans over the past five years with many public consultations highlighting the need for safe, off-road walking routes to keep people active and healthy.ldquoEvery village wanted to know how their walks could be integrated into the wider network of trails around Lecale, he continued. ldquoThere was a demand to know the details of the law and how they could assert local walking routes in their area.ldquoResidentsrsquo associations in the Downpatrick area led by those in Stream Street actually commissioned technical reports into how walks like the four kilometre Quoile River Walk could once again be integrated with the network of parks like Delamont and Castle Ward.Cllr Enright added: ldquoThey wanted cycleways on new greenways to Dundrum, Ballynahinch, Belfast and Comber following old railway lines and we packed all this information into the book with maps, photographs and references. I am sure that anyone with an interest in these matters will find it an invaluable reference document for their endeavours.The new publication has also been given a ringing endorsement by Dr Tim Campbell, Director of the Saint Patrick Centre in Downpatrick.He said: ldquoThis book illustrates how Downpatrickrsquos tourism hub around the Cathedral, Down County Museum and the Mound of Down could be linked off-road to every village in Lecale and rejoin the local way-marked trails like the Saint Patrickrsquos Way and Ulster Way to make a network of walks and cycle paths in East Down.The new book is available at Kevin Ogrsquos shop in Strangford, the St. Patrick Centre, The Road Houses Bar, Oakley Fayre, Down County Museum and Down Arts Centre.

The council also hopes to acquire match funding from central government.Among the key issues identied by council officials is either restricting or banning altogether unsorted black bin bag waste. Thousands of people regularly empty a iety waste into the bin bags and take them to the recycling centres. But that could be about to change.Council officials also want to vigorously challenge the perception that the centres are viewed by many as ldquodumps and reinforce the message that they are for recycled waste only.They say the misuse of the centres has potential cost implications for the authority, with the review examining detailed guidelines and systems which are required for what is being described as the ldquoproper operation of the recycling centres.The review examined entrance policies and a potential restriction or complete ban on large vans using the centres with a daily restriction on the amount of waste the facilities can receive.There is also growing concern at senior management level that a signicant amount of the waste being taken to recycling centres ends up in the general waste stream as it cannot be recycled. Council officials say addressing this issue will cut costs and produce savings.Last night, politicians were asked for permission to complete a detailed report on the way forward, based on the evidence gathered during the review process, with a particular focus on centre opening hours and staffing levels that must be achieved at no extra cost.Councillors were told the report will also make a recommendation to harmonise policies and procedures across all current recycling centres in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.Over recent months, local politicians have expressed concern at a number of fly-tipping and illegal dumping incidents across the district, with several taking place within a stonersquos throw of the Cloonagh Road facility in Downpatrick.This particular facility has long since passed its sell-by-date with work on a poundm replacement at the nearby Flying Horse Road currently underway.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Such a development would have the inevitable impact of diminishing the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom,” a GOLI statement said.“Whilst uncertainty abounds regarding a no-deal scenario, the people of Northern Ireland should not be expected to accept a poor deal which goes back on the assurances offered by the prime minister throughout this process.The Grand Orange Lodge of Irelands headquarters at Schomberg House, Cregagh Road, Belfast“We recognise that many in the business sector have given the withdrawal proposals their support. We also recognise that within our own organisation there are business owners, farmers and fishermen – none of whom want to see their own financial interests injured as a result of a failure to formulate an agreed way forward.“As a stakeholder in local society, we too wish to see a settled, prosperous and confident Northern Ireland. It appears, however, that in ensuring a frictionless north-south borderthe current proposals lose sight of the financial risk of creating new checks and controls on inward goods from the rest of the United Kingdom – recently valued at £.bn per year.”The statement continued: “Despite a recent meeting with Northern Ireland Office officials, and examination of the aspirational and non-binding ‘Political Declaration’, we remain unconvinced that the current proposed agreement is a good deal for Northern Ireland – economically or constitutionally.“The backstop may only be deployed as a worst-case scenario – but whilst it continues to be an option, it continues to place the future legal and constitutional position of Northern Ireland in question. As such, we believe it threatens the Union.“It should come as no surprise that this institution will never be neutral on the Union.”Urging politicians across the UK to work towards “a better deal”, the statement added: “The Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland calls on all political representatives who share a commitment to the Union, at home in Northern Ireland and in the rest of the United Kingdom, to come together to oppose the current withdrawal agreement and to use their collective influence to deliver a better deal for all the people of the United Kingdom.”May flies into NI to sell Brexit deal Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

This has been at the forefront of my mind throughout the negotiations. It has been especially clear to me when I have visited communities along the border in Northern Ireland and seen first-hand how important it is that the unique circumstances local employers face are recognised in any agreement.“They need to be able to trade freely across the border with Ireland and have unfettered access to the rest of the United Kingdom’s market. This deal makes that possible and that’s why, across Northern Ireland, employers large and small have been getting behind it.”Leaders in the business and farming sectors have expressed their support for the deal and publicly warned about the potential consequences of no deal for NI.Historic ‘meaningful vote’ on historic Brexit deal set for December  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"But the DUP has warned thatthe backstop is triggered, it will carve NI off from the rest of the UK.The party is concerned the backstop could threaten the constitutional integrity of the Union and place a regulatory border down the Irish Sea, leaving NI aligned to some EU rules post-Brexit.UUP leader Robin Swann has called on the PM to put plans in place for the extension of Article  “rather than risk the future of the Union for the sake of meeting a deadline”.The North Antrim MLA added: “We do not believe that this withdrawal agreement is as good as it gets. Andthe price to pay for it continues to be a border up the Irish Sea, we will continue to oppose it and tell the prime minister that the UK Government needs to go back to the negotiating table.”Meanwhile, the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland has voiced its opposition to the draft agreement, warning that it would “diminish the constitutional integrity of the UK”.It came as Taoiseach Leo Varadkar met with the Grand Secretary of the Orange Order, Reverend Mervyn Gibson in Dublin yesterday.try catch     .               ..

OK, he and his we have jetted off to Lanzarote to get a break from work, the weather and, of course, the furore over Brexit. Sandra ChapmanHe wouldn’t normally decide to take a break at this time of year. But, as a Brexiteer, he says he has had his fill of politicians, politics and the  promises over Brexit. He says he will be back, but threatens to emigratethe country falls apart.He got a lot of sympathy from Himself who also has flown off this week to the British mainland leaving me with just the dog, which I’m pretty sure is happy to get a bit of peace and quiet from the pair of us who really haven’t been able to argue in any logical fashion about the political crisis surrounding us. Dogs are wonderful at pretending they understand everything you say especiallyyou are saying it near the cupboard where the treats reside.The whole sorry saga of Brexit is impossible to escape.I was about to roll up a page of newspaper to light the fire only to be drawn to the headline at the top: ‘The EU will turn us into captiveswe sign up to this appalling sell-out.’ It was the latest rant in the Dailyfrom Boris Johnson, who wants the Northern Ireland backstop scrapped with both sidesto simply ‘commit to avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland by the use of new unobtrusive checks and discussions of the future economic partnership’ where, he says ‘the Irish discussion rightly belongs’.suitcases packed.That was the day before Sinn Fein’s president Mary Lou McDonald was shouting at the top of her voice about the DUP being out of step on Brexit and ‘must face reality’. Now, I wonder what that reality might be  Seconds later she was urging Arlene Foster to “wake up and smell the coffee”. This is the very same Mary Lou who claims to have “no regrets” over her handling of the Mairia Cahill case. Mary Lou can shout all she wants. Only her own side will be listening.The Northern Ireland born Labour MP for Vauxhall Kate Hoey had a lot to say this week too. Ms Hoey informs us she has “ploughed through” the  pages of the proposed withdrawal agreement plus the explanation notes – that makes her a hero in my eyes – and declares that “Northern Ireland, to all intents and purposes, becomes separated in many ways from the rest of the United Kingdom”, with the backstop arrangements looking like they were written by the Irish government.All in all it means that the Republic of Ireland would, effectively, be representing Northern Ireland in the EU, she believes. A highly respected politician, one not given to exaggeration, I would say she has got it right. That was one page of newspaper I saved from the flames.Then, of course, there are the Scots whose nationalism is getting a fresh kick from the Brexit chaos.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister, accuses Theresa May of asking people to “take a blindfold leap off a clf” with her Brexit deal. Ms Sturgeon, as we all know, has her heart set on independence for Scotland. She may yet be successful second time around. How amazing it is that women are playing such a big role in the whole Brexit saga.Years ago Margaret Thatcher had the political field all to herself. Had she been in charge today she would long ago have hand-bagged Jean-Claude Junker and the elegant Mr Barnier into submission. Theresa May, on the other hand, looks like the one being hand-bagged.Legacy Scandal: The IRA was able to wage terrorism on Castlederg because it was near the safe haven of the Irish Republic Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"So when does this crisis begin to calm down so that the rest of us can get on with planning our Christmas  It’s not looking good.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Christmas1.jpg","title":"thought about the christmas party its just a few weeks away","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business A time for giving, the festive party is an event that puts the spotlight firmly on employer gratitude. Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come.

And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
