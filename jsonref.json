Back then, Margaret Thatcher decided to break up municipal bus companies everywhere across England, except London. \u0027We have had 35 years of rising fares, routes being cut and passenger numbers falling. We have barely any night buses, no Oyster system and no daily cap.\u0027I mention it to help people understand why the North feels the way it does and, hopefully, win some support for our calls. A single bus journey in Harpurhey, Greater Manchester, should cost the same as one in Haringey, London — ie £1.55, not £4 plus. Is that so unreasonable? I don’t think so. Levelling up should mean London-style transport for all English city regions.\u0027If London got behind that, it would reflect well on it and reduce anti-London feeling.\u0027Mr Burnham\u0027s acceptance of a column in a newspaper whose readership is 200 miles from his political base in the North West comes as he admits he would like to lead Labour after Keir Starmer. But he also singled out for praise a potential rival, London mayor Sadiq Khan, saying he should be given additional powers to put him on a par with his counterparts in New York and Paris.Mr Khan himself raised eyebrows yesterday when he visited a factory in Yorkshire.The Mayor of London visited an electric bus factory in North Yorkshire, which manufactures state-of-the-art vehicles for London\u0027s 500-strong zero-emission fleet. At the weekend Mr Burnham claimed Labour would have held on to more northern seats at the  2019 election if he had been party leader instead of Jeremy Corbyn.The Greater Manchester mayor made the claim as he revealed he would run for the leadership again after the next election if he had enough support.Mr Burnham, a former health secretary under Gordon Brown, came a distant second to hard Left icon Mr Corbyn in the 2015 Labour leadership election, polling just 19 per cent of votes.He served as a shadow minister before quitting national politics to become mayor of Manchester before Labour\u0027s catastrophic display at the 2019 election, its worst since the 1930s.But buoyed by an increased majority in Manchester in the election last week, and Keir Starmer\u0027s increasing difficulty over Labour\u0027s wider results, Mr Burnham has learned towards a new run at the party leadership.Speaking to the Observer he was deeply critical of modern Labour\u0027s failure to take a stronger stance on major policy issues, particularly social care reform, and said the party lacked the boldness to attempt any move on the scale of its greatest achievement - creating the NHS in 1948.Mr Burnham said had he beaten Mr Corbyn to the leadership six years ago he would have been more successful in stopping the Conservatives from breaking the so-called \u0027red wall\u0027 - including the many northern heartland seats lost in the 2019 general election, and the crushing defeat endured in this month\u0027s Hartlepool by-election.\u0027I still think life would have been different if I had won,\u0027 said Mr Burnham, who romped to victory in his mayoral election on May 6, taking all 215 wards in Greater Manchester.\u0027I think we would be stronger in taking on the Government. I don\u0027t think we\u0027d have lost as many northern seats had I won.\u0027An Opinium poll published in the paper shows Mr Burnham - who also failed in a 2010 leadership bid - is widely seen as the most likely and able successor to current leader Sir Keir Starmer, with 47 per cent ranking him on top, ahead of 35 per cent for London mayor Sadiq Khan and 29 per cent for Leeds Central MP and former Labour frontbencher Hilary Benn.Andy Burnham: The Government wants to ide us but together we are a powerful force | Evening Standard"},{"url":null,"title":"Tesla driver going 82mph ASLEEP took two miles pull cops tried stop him","story":"Share this articleTesla driver ticketed for falling asleep while on autopilot at 82 mph"},{"url":null,"title":"Now 3 424 cases Indian Covid variant spotted cases double week","story":"Share this article Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, added: \u0027As cases of VOC-21APR-02 continue to rise, it is absolutely vital that people living in areas where prevalence is high come forward to get the vaccine. It is the best defence we have against the spread of this disease.\u0027As we start to get back to normal life, it is very important that we do not become complacent. All of us need to remain responsible and vigilant. Get tested regularly, get the vaccine when offered it, and practice \u0027hands, face, space, fresh air\u0027. It will save lives.\u0027In Bolton, more than 33,000 DIY test kits have already been given out to curb the Indian variant\u0027s spread and mobile testing units have been set up in the Greater Manchester town for walk-in PCR swabs.Health officials visited more than 9,000 properties during door-to-door visits over the weekend, giving out over 3,400 test kits, PHE said.Surge testing is being deployed in Blackburn, Bedford, Burnley, Hounslow, Kirklees, Leicester, North Tyneside, Glasgow and Moray in an attempt to stomp out the mutant strain. The Government is also monitoring waste water in large swathes of the country to detect early signs of the strain spreading in more areas.  It comes after official statistics showed the nation\u0027s Covid outbreak is still flat, despite the rapid spread of the Indian variant.Public Health England\u0027s weekly surveillance report found cases remained \u0027stable\u0027 nationally at around 12,000 last week, and dropped in all age groups except five to nine-year-olds. Hospitalisations with the virus also fell across the country, while infection rates dipped in every region except the North West, which is struggling against an outbreak of the Indian strain. Some 95 out of 149 local authorities — or 64 per cent — saw their Covid cases dip last week. In contrast, there were 66 that recorded a drop over the previous seven-day spell. But Dr Yvonne Doyle, PHE\u0027s medical director, said the agency was concerned about the Indian variant and was \u0027constantly monitoring the situation\u0027. She added: \u0027Until we know more it\u0027s vital we don\u0027t let our guard down too soon and remain cautious. We do not want to undo the huge progress we\u0027ve made so far.\u0027Other figures from the PHE\u0027s weekly surveillance report showed the ten areas with the biggest Covid outbreaks were all hotspots for the Indian variant.But SAGE adviser and University College London epidemiologist Professor Andrew Hayward today claimed the UK was at the beginning of another wave because of the rapid spread of the mutant strain, with infections expected to rise nationally in the coming weeks.\u0027Although it was originally imported through travel to India it spread fairly effectively first of all within households after that and now more broadly within communities,\u0027 he told BBC Breakfast. \u0027So I don\u0027t really see why it wouldn\u0027t continue to spread in other parts of the country.\u0027He added: \u0027Obviously we are doing everything we can to contain that, but it is likely more generalised measures may start to be needed to control it.\u0027  But Professor Hayward\u0027s comments come amid growing optimism from Number 10 that the Indian variant won\u0027t jeopardise plans to ease all lockdown restrictions on June 21, despite fears the highly-transmissible strain could scupper \u0027freedom day\u0027.Boris Johnson last night told the powerful 1922 committee of Tory MPs he was \u0027even more cautiously optimistic\u0027 the next stage of relaxation can go ahead. He said: \u0027I know there are anxieties about new variants but we can see nothing to suggest that we have to deviate from the road map.\u0027And more promising figures from King\u0027s College London\u0027s symptom-tracking app also predicted Covid cases are not rising nationally, despite surging infections in hotspots. Experts estimated around 2,750 people are falling ill with the coronavirus every day across the UK, with the figure having barely changed in a week.Professor Tim Spector, the epidemiologist who leads the app, said B.1.617.2 \u0027hasn\u0027t altered numbers significantly\u0027 and outbreaks remain focused in hotspots, such as Bolton. \u0027While the outbreaks remain localised and UK numbers are steady and most cases appear mild, it’s highly unlikely to cause the NHS to be overrun or stop us coming out of lockdown,\u0027 he said. SAGE scientists had predicted there would be a third wave of the pandemic as restrictions were eased and more people were allowed to mix. But questions remain over how big the outbreak will be because vaccines will stop many people from catching the disease and being hospitalised. Government advisers don\u0027t believe the resurgence will be anywhere near as bad as January\u0027s crisis because of jabs and warmer weather.Almost 3,000 cases of the Indian variant have been detected in the UK, with the figure having quadrupled in a fortnight. Surge testing has been deployed in Bedford, Burnley, Hounslow, Kirklees, Leicester and North Tyneside to root out cases of the strain.It comes as ministers accelerate the vaccination roll-out with plans to reach all over-18s within a month, with over-30s set to be offered their first dose by the end of May. More than 36.9million Britons — or seven in ten adults — have already had at least a jab. England\u0027s roll-out was expanded to 34 and 35-year-olds today.  PHE publishes a weekly surveillance report tracking the spread of the virus across the country.They found the infection rate had fallen in almost every age group. It was highest among 10 to 19-year-olds (43.9 cases per 100,000 people) and lowest among the over-70s (4.1) who have each been offered at least one dose of the Covid vaccine.Hospitalisations with the virus also dipped nationally from 1.02 to 0.73 per 100,000 people.Bolton — which is struggling against the country\u0027s largest outbreak of the Indian variant — has the highest Covid case rate in England (328.3).Its neighbour Blackburn with Darwen has the second highest rate (159.7), followed by Bedford (124.65).  Kirklees had the fourth highest infection rate (73.4) after cases rose by 30 per cent in a week. The council has been identified as an \u0027area of concern\u0027 by public health authorities after cases of the Indian variant were identified there. Surge testing was launched in the area yesterday.It was followed by Leicester (50), Hounslow (48.9), Manchester (44.1), Bury (42.9), North Tyneside (42.3) and Luton (42.2) which all have outbreaks of the Indian variant.SAGE scientists have already warned there will be a third wave of the virus in the country, which was expected to hit as more restrictions were eased.Professor Hayward said: \u0027While I think we\u0027ve always thought we would have another wave of Covid, the size of that wave is going to very much depend on how transmissible the variant that causes it is and what proportion of the population have been vaccinated when it hits.\u0027He added surge testing had been launched in hotspots in an attempt to halt the spread of the variant.But that spiralling cases suggested it would become the main variant across the country — and displace the currently dominant Kent variant. \u0027But the scale of this is different (to other variants) and the number of places affected is different and the number of cases is different and the speed of increase is different,\u0027 he said. \u0027So my hunch is that this is going to become the dominant strain across the country, maybe even across the world, and that you know that really brings it back down to this race against the vaccine and the virus except the virus just got faster.\u0027 The Indian variant has already spread to at least 48 countries, figures show, and has been spotted on every continent except Antarctica."},{"url":null,"title":"Martin Bashir stands denials addresses Princess Dianas brave interview amid BBC inquiry","story":"Share this article Lord Dyson said in his report that so far as the BBC was concerned the Diana note was ‘conclusive evidence’ that the fake bank statements had not been used to persuade her to agree to the interview.But he added: ‘With the benefit of hindsight, it can be seen that they should have considered the possibility that Mr Bashir secured the interview indirectly by showing the documents to Earl Spencer.’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c5b32673117cc3c1768478f16c8482175b24138/0_352_5315_3191/master/5315.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=5366a54aece456b1ec6849a145086b21","title":"us pga championship 2021 first round live scores updates kiawah island golf","story":"Time to hand back to Scott Murray, who will guide you through the rest of the day’s action.

He also emphasized that the US will ‘remain committed to working with the United Nations and other international stakeholders to revive rapid humanitarian assistance, and marshall international support for the people of Gaza, and the Gaza reconstruction efforts.”  “We will do this in full partnership with the Palestinian Authority,” he said, “not Hamas”. The US had reportedly thrice blocked over UN security council resolutions that would have condemned Israeli military actions and called for a ceasefire as hundreds in Gaza, including children, died. The president said he spoke with Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu, Egypt’s Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi, and Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority.   “I believe the Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve to live safely and securely and enjoy equal measures of freedom, prosperity, and democracy,” he said. “My administration will continue our quiet relentless diplomacy toward that end.”At a news conference with Danish foreign minister Jeppe Kofod, Greenland’s premier, Mute Egede, and foreign minister Pele Broberg, Blinken reaffirmed that the US had no desire. to bid for the island.  Blinken was in Greenland as part of the Biden administration’s efforts to reaffirm a relationship with “our Arctic partners, Greenland and Denmark.” Trump had discussed purchasing Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory. Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen had responded that the island was not for sale. He will be delivering remarks on the matter in about 30 minutes – stay tuned for live coverage.  The ceasefire agreement today came a day after Biden spoke to Netanyahu, saying he wanted “a significant de-escalation” to take the situation. Despite pressure from progressive Democratic lawmakers, he avoided putting public pressure on Israel. As my colleagues Oliver Holmes in Jerusalem and Julian Borger in Washington explain: Here’s where the day stands so far: Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned.The president’s remarks will come shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office announced a ceasefire in Gaza, after 11 days of attacks between Israeli forces and Hamas. More than 200 people, most of them Palestinian, have died in the violence. In a phone call with Netanyahu yesterday, Biden pressed the Israeli prime minister to take immediate steps toward a ceasefire.  It is quite unusual for the White House to lift a lid, which marks the end of the president’s public appearances for the day. The decision signals that Biden may speak on-camera this evening, and it seems likely those remarks will focus on the Gaza ceasefire.Senior Israeli defence officials recommended accepting the ceasefire proposal after claiming “great accomplishments” in the operation, according to a statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office. “The political leaders emphasised that the reality on the ground will be that which determines the future of the campaign,” the statement said. The White House said it believed Israel had achieved “significant military objectives” and was in a position to wind down operations. “We have seen reports of a move toward a potential ceasefire. That’s clearly encouraging,” the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said this afternoon. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, added further pressure, calling for an immediate ceasefire and urging Israel’s military to exercise maximum restraint and for Hamas to stop indiscriminate rocket fire. Guterres described Gaza as “hell on earth” for children, and said he would launch a full humanitarian appeal for funding as soon as possible. “The hostilities have caused serious damage to vital civilian infrastructure in Gaza, including roads and electricity lines, contributing to a humanitarian emergency. Crossings into Gaza have been closed and power shortages are affecting water supplies,” Guterres said. The Democratic leader said he was proud to work with Senator Mazie Hirono and congresswoman Grace Meng on the bill, which passed the House on Tuesday. Schumer said the law will send the message that “racism and violence against Asian Americans has no place in our society”, echoing Biden’s comments at the bill-signing ceremony.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

They’d want me to be happy.”’ “For me what happened to the kids was an act of insanity. I can’t see it any other way. I can’t understand it any other way,” says Andrew McGinley, the father of Conor (9), Darragh (7) and Carla (3), whose mother Deirdre Morley was found not guilty of their murder by reason of insanity in the Central Criminal Court on Thursday.In the well-kept home in Newcastle, Co Dublin, they shared as a family before their world shattered on January 24th, 2020, the children’s presence is still everywhere. They are in the completed Lego sets displayed in Perspex boxes on the windowsill, the paintings on the wall, bean bags in the front room that he recently had repaired and refilled – because he could not bear to part with them. They are in the Marvel jigsaw on the kitchen table that the boys never got to finish. It went awry after Carla tried to help with it, he remembers with a sad smile.He has begun to distribute some of their toys to people who might benefit from them, but there are certain things he has held on to. He has kept a small pile of toys to give in time to their mother Deirdre, or “Dee” as he still calls her.“There’s a lot of emotions, there’s a lot of difficult and complicated emotions. But for me, I want to live a positive life.”He has to pause for a moment.“And I want to do that, you know, in order to keep their memories alive . . . Because you could get could get swallowed up by everything else and at times I do,” he says, his voice breaking again.“My mantra is, ‘I know that they wouldn’t want me to be sad. They’d want me to be happy.’ So yeah, sometimes I have to remind myself that . . . I want to move forward positively.”This week has been hard, but “the trial for me was a process that had to happen. For me, nothing is more difficult than finding your three children dead,” he says.In a statement issued after the verdict, he said he was no closer to understanding why his children had died. What he does know is that their mother loved them. The court heard repeatedly that they were “very, very deeply loved” and “cherished”.“I can see now, Dee, she didn’t want me to know the full extent of her illness. And certainly for her family as well, she wanted to put her best foot forward,” he says.“You’re sitting in the courtroom, you’re listening to some of the counselling sessions she had with the professional services, and you’re seeing a totally different person, and you’re hearing about a totally different person. So I think the two parties needed to come together, the professional services and the support circle. I would be convinced had that happened, that Conor, Darragh and Carla would be alive today.”He now wants an inclusive investigation into her diagnosis, treatment and medication prior to the family tragedy to help the family “understand the insanity” that took his children’s lives.The court heard that his wife was diagnosed as suffering from a moderate depressive illness prior to the children’s deaths. The psychiatrists who gave evidence before the court came to slightly differing conclusions regarding her diagnosis. One, Brenda Wright, diagnosed her with bipolar affective disorder type II. Mary Davoren said it was difficult to diagnose her but “at a minimum she suffered from a recurring depressive disorder”.Within a few weeks of her admission to the Central Mental Hospital in January 2020, Deirdre Morley felt back to the “real me” on an anti-psychotic that she described as a “wonder drug”.“It would make sense to involve families more in the care of anybody with a mental health illness, because you are relying on responses that can possibly be skewed by the illness. For us as a family, we’re sitting in the courtroom, we were listening to the evidence from the two expert witnesses and we’ve just ended up with more questions than at the start of the trial,” he says.“When we look at the medical records, we can see flags raised and we’ve just been left with questions. I have been in touch with Dee, and I’ve met Dee, but I’m not going to comment further.”He says “the trial was never going to give me the answers I needed, it was an act of insanity I’ve accepted that . . . I don’t think you can come to any other conclusion.”But what he wants is for “the professional services who were treating Dee, over the last couple of years prior to the children dying, to meet with me and the Morley family, so that we can understand. We’re left with an awful lot of questions that this trial was never going to answer, but we need those answers . . . We all thought she was getting the best care, and we hope that she was, but we have questions.”He wants lessons learned about the need for a “more inclusive and collaborative approach with families. I would strongly recommend to anybody who has a loved one within the care of the mental health services, they need to get in there and become an advocate for their care, they need to be aware of their treatment, their medication, all the facts, everything.”But for now, he is focused on “living a positive life” for the children.This has meant fulfilling promises he made to the children. In Conor’s case that was a promise to help him set up a YouTube channel. Conor was “quiet enough” but creative and funny. He remembers a day he spent with Conor not long before he died, noticing “he was turning into a wee man . . . he was a smart kid and a sensible kid and he had such a great sense of humour.”He promised seven-year-old Darragh he would start coaching Rathcoole boys football team, something he has done. He is surprised whenever he is asked if it is painful to be around his sons’ friends. “It’s funny that people would think that way. I enjoy it.”As for Carla, “she could have bought and sold the world”, he says his eyes filling with tears again. He promised her that he would make a snowman with her one day. In her name, he’s going to organise a snowman colouring competition. “Because they died so young, maybe in a way it’s giving them life.”For all the unfathomable depths of his grief, it gives him solace to know that his children knew they were loved and that no matter how busy he was with work, he always made time for them. “If you have kids, they’re your family. All five of you. I used to try and get home to take my last call at home,” he says.“If I saw them on the trampoline, I’d go out and join them . . . I don’t think there was a playground in the whole of Dublin that we hadn’t visited at one stage or another. We were always doing stuff.”In his darkest moments – and there are many, like Father’s Day, which was for him the lowest point – what gives him hope is “thinking about the kids and doing all these projects. Some days, the alarm goes off, and I try to keep a routine going, and what gets me out of bed is my love for them, quite simply.”The other things that has provided some comfort over the past year has been the kindness of other people. He also understands that some people have found it too difficult to be around him.“There’s people that I haven’t seen since the funeral. People who would have been here for the wake, I haven’t seen them since. And you know, I’m okay with that. And I just think maybe they feel awkward, or maybe they don’t know what to say. Nobody does. A lot of people would have said to me, ‘I don’t know what to say here’. And I always responded the same way. ‘So let’s start with hello. And we’ll take it from there.’ ”Somebody sent him a “grief graph”, outlining the various stages that they thought he would experience. But for him, there are no neat stages, there is just trying to find a way to keep going. “We’re all so different. And we will all deal with it in our own way. And I do know that some people may think I should be curled up in a ball instead of being on Twitter. But I’m on Twitter because Conor wanted to be online, and wanted to be there. So I’m trying to do that for him.”He will keep going so that he can keep the children’s memories alive. “To do that, it is the charity, As Darragh Did, it’s Conor’s Clips (the YouTube account), it is the snowman for Carla, it is the books. That’s what I have to do. And that’s what I want to do. My mantra is, ‘I know that they wouldn’t want me to be sad. They’d want me to be happy.’ Sometimes I have to remind myself of that.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid international travel may return before august coveney says","story":"International travel may return before August, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has told a private Fine Gael meeting.Sources at Wednesday night’s parliamentary party meeting say Mr Coveney said estimates given by Leo Varadkar about international travel not returning until at least August could be seen as being conservative.Mr Coveney told TDs and Senators that “it may happen before then”.

Photograph:  David GrayGettyBoris Johnson chaired a meeting of senior ministers in Downing Street on Thursday amid a fierce dispute within his cabinet over the scope of a trade deal with Australia. Farming groups have warned about the impact of granting tariff-free, quota-free access to Australian beef and lamb on British agriculture.While agriculture secretary George Eustice and cabinet office minister Michael Gove are reported to oppose the move, the smart money is on Johnson agreeing to Australia’s demand for full market access for its meat exporters. Among those believed to be arguing for an expansive deal are international trade secretary Liz Truss and Brexit minister David Frost. The Australian deal would be the first major trade agreement Britain has negotiated that is not a rollover of arrangements London enjoyed with third countries as a member of the European Union. Failure to agree terms with such a close, like-minded ally could send a signal to other potential trade partners that Global Britain is less buccaneering than advertised.Welsh first minister Mark Drakeford warned on Thursday that allowing tariff-free imports of Australian lamb could threaten his country’s identity as it hits hill farmers in the Welsh-speaking heartlands.“We’re talking here about the things that make Wales Wales – that’s what’s at stake here,” he told the BBC.“How can our hill farmers compete with Australian climates? How can our hill farmers compete with the space that is available for the huge farms that they have in Australia? How can we compete when our standards of animal welfare and environmental standards are different and are higher than they are in Australia?”The Scottish National Party (SNP) has made similar protests on behalf of Scottish beef producers, who cannot compete with Australia’s massive feedlots and ranches, a complaint echoed by farmers’ groups throughout Britain.\u0026nbspThe trade deal could hurt Irish farmers too. Half of Ireland’s beef exports go to the United Kingdom, valued at almost €1 billion a year and accounting for almost all of Britain’s beef imports from the EU. More Australian beef would not only offer competition in the British market but could drive exports to the EU of British beef displaced from the domestic market.Britain’s food products enjoy tariff-free, quota-free access to the EU market so Irish beef could face more competition in both the British and European markets. Northern Irish farmers who supply the market in Great Britain could also be affected but they would enjoy access to the Australian market, while the Northern Ireland protocol would block tariff-free Australian meat imports to the North.‘Level playing field’Trade experts suggest that farmers’ fears about the deal may be unjustified because Australia sends most of its meat exports to Asian countries. Its beef is not especially cheap and although 40 per cent of Australian beef is from cattle raised with hormonal growth enhancers, the meat it exports tend to be hormone-free.Tariff-free access is likely to be phased in over 10-15 years and the deal could include the kind of “level playing field” conditions Britain found so offensive in negotiations with the EU. Earlier this year, Britain’s trade and agriculture commission, which includes farming industry figures, recommended that Britain should grant tariff-free, quota-free access for food products in future trade deals but with conditions.It should “ensure that agri-food imports meet relevant UK and international standards on food safety and biosecurity”. And deals should “match tariff-free market access to relevant climate, environment, animal welfare and ethical standards, remedying competition issues arising where permitted imports do not meet relevant UK and international standards”.Weak farming lobbyThe British government wants the Australian trade deal to be agreed in time for next month’s G7 summit in Cornwall, which Australia’s prime minister will attend as a guest. It sees the agreement as a template for other big, post-Brexit trade deals – and that is just what farmers in Ireland as well as Britain should fear.One of Britain’s big negotiating advantages in trade talks is that its weak farming lobby and a popular enthusiasm for cheap food means it can make concessions more easily than many countries on market access for agricultural products. Most potential trade partners prioritise market access for their farmers, while Britain’s priority is opening up markets for the services that make up 80 per cent of its economy.Australian beef and lamb may represent only a modest threat but if Britain offers similar terms to other big producers like Brazil, the consequences for Irish farming could be immense.\u0026nbsp How is Brexit affecting you?

Yet despite the retreat of the pandemic in the face of a remarkably successful vaccination programme, the fear of a Covid upsurge continues to dominate debate around public health almost to the exclusion of all other considerations.The Prime Minister, who had been confident until recently that the “road map” to normality was on track, is now hedging his bets. Arguably the pace of the unlocking was already too cautious given the rapid decline in hospitalisations and fatalities – supposedly the two key metrics for deciding on the next steps.Where is any cost-benefit analysis of keeping these restrictions in place? Governments may legitimately take draconian action in the midst of a rapidly accelerating epidemic but it is unacceptable to continue with these constraints when the impact of the virus is both low and localised. Those who say the measures are justified in order to limit the risk of future infections need to ask themselves when this would end.Contingency plans that had been drawn up for dealing with pandemics were largely abandoned when the coronavirus hit. Lockdowns spread around the world from China and then Italy as hospitals came under massive pressure in some areas. But no one had ever carried out an assessment of the effect lockdowns would have on society beyond the public health benefit occasioned by keeping people apart.Fear of being blamed is at the heart of this. Dominic Cummings, the former No 10 aide, is promising to make startling revelations about what was done in the early stages of the pandemic when he appears before a select committee next week. As Clement Attlee once said of Harold Laski, a period of silence on his part would be welcome.Even though the most vulnerable people have been vaccinated, the Government’s concern appears to be the potential spread of a more virulent strain of Covid among the unvaccinated population, placing pressure once again on hospitals. But this should be addressed either by increasing capacity or developing triage procedures that allow people to be treated away from hospital.Moreover, why are the rules governing face coverings not being withdrawn? In America, where Covid rates are higher than here, Joe Biden has effectively bowed to the action already being taken by many US states and removed the requirement for vaccinated people to wear masks. Here, it is startling to see so few MPs in the Commons chamber, and for those who are there all to be masked, at a time when offices up and down the land are trying to get their employees to return to their desks. Vaccinated MPs who recently went into the chamber without a mask were upbraided by the Speaker who threatened to suspend the sitting. What example are our elected representatives setting? They are just projecting fear. If people want to carry on wearing masks, let them – but to insist that those who have been fully vaccinated must do so is perverse.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"banksy loses second trademark case refusing disclose identity","story":"Banksy’s rights to his own portfolio of work is “at risk” after the anonymous graffiti artist suffered his second legal defeat because he refused to disclose his identity to judges, The  can reveal.The street artist has been stripped of a trademark for his “best known” artwork called ‘Laugh Now’ because he was found to have acted in “bad faith” and has repeatedly criticised intellectual property laws, a judgment says.It is the latest twist in his increasingly bitter battle with a UK greetings card company which recreates his works for sale.Lawyers for Full Colour Black Ltd have successfully argued twice that Banksy cannot trademark some of his images because he never intended to use them for commercial purposes.The European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) ruling warns he could struggle to copyright his works because to reveal himself as the “unquestionable owner” would “take away from the secretive persona which propels his fame and success”.While copyright protects an artist’s work from reproduction for their lifetime and 70 years after their death, a trademark identifies and secures the commercial origins of a product.The 17-page judgment says the 2002 work for a Brighton nightclub, Laugh Now, or ‘monkey sign’, features 10 monkeys holding signs, some saying ‘laugh now, but one day we’ll be in charge’.The panel heard how the artist “sprayed” graffiti in public places, invited people to download his works to make copies and claimed “copyright is for losers” because all public art is automatically free. His lawyers insisted he was simply being “ironic”.But three years ago, he began applying for trademarks in the EU and America, prompting the card manufacturer to challenge them.In response, the artist set up a shop in 2019 claiming meeting trademark requirements was “not a very sexy muse”.The judgment says although “Banksy… is clearly against property laws” he is entitled to trademark his work, but he had done so in bad faith because he had “had no intention to genuinely use the sign as a trademark”.Aaron Wood, trademark attorney at Blaser Mills Law, who represented the greeting cards company, said: “He famously said copyright is for losers - so far for him it seems trademark law is also for losers.“The bigger issue for him is that it puts his global portfolio at risk, and dents any interest he may have in the rights.”Pest Control Office Limited, which represented Banksy in the action, failed to respond for comment, but issued an automated email which said the message “has been received, and though a response may not be forthcoming (or in fact ever composed) we appreciate you getting in touch.”The company was ordered to pay costs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"duke cambridge bbc fuelled mothers paranoia","story":"The Duke of Cambridge has said it brought him “indescribable sadness” that Martin Bashir’s BBC interview with Diana, Princess of Wales, had “contributed significantly to her fear, paranoia and isolation” in the final years of her life.Prince William blamed the failures of BBC bosses for the harm done to his mother, after a landmark inquiry concluded that Bashir used deceitful behaviour in a serious breach of the broadcaster\u0027s guidelines to secure the 1995 Panorama interview with the princess.After a six-month inquiry, Lord Dyson, a former master of the Rolls, also accused the BBC of effectively covering up Bashir\u0027s wrong-doing.The Duke of Sussex went further than his brother in a separate statement, and directly linked the interview to their mother’s death.Prince Harry said: “The ripple effect of a culture of exploitation and unethical practices ultimately took her life. Our mother lost her life because of this, and nothing has changed.”On Thursday night, following publication of the report, Oliver Dowden, the Culture Secretary, threatened an overhaul of the broadcaster.  The Dukes each issued a rare personal statement following publication of the report.Prince William said the interview had destroyed his parents’ relationship and had since hurt countless others.He added: “It brings indescribable sadness to know that the BBC’s failures contributed significantly to her fear, paranoia and isolation that I remember from those final years with her.”The Duke of Cambridge said the Princess had been failed “not just by a rogue reporter, but by leaders at the BBC who looked the other way rather than asking the tough questions”.While the Duke of Cambridge stopped short of directly linking the interview to his mother’s death, his uncle, Earl Spencer said he draws a line connecting his sister meeting Bashir and her death two years later.In a video statement, the Duke added: “It is my firm view that this Panorama programme holds no legitimacy and should never be aired again.“It effectively established a false narrative which, for over a quarter of a century, has been commercialised by the BBC and others.”He said these failings “not only let my mother down, and my family down they let the public down too.”The BBC now faces further scrutiny.Mr Dowden said: “Lord Dyson’s report reveals damning failings at the heart of the BBC. We will now reflect on Lord Dyson\u0027s thorough report and consider whether further governance reforms at the BBC are needed in the mid-term Charter review.“I welcome the fact that the new leadership launched this independent inquiry and expect them to ensure that this can never happen again.”Tim Davie, the BBC’s director-general, has sent letters of apology to the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince Harry, in an attempt to limit the damage caused by Bashir’s deceit.“Martin Bashir employed lies and faked documents to gain access to the princess,” wrote Mr Davie. “We also accept he made a series of lurid and untrue claims about the Prince of Wales, members of his staff and other members of the Royal family and that Martin Bashir did so intending to play on the Princess’s fears in order to arouse her interest in him and without concern for the impact on those he maligned.”Letters of apology were also sent to Earl Spencer and to Alan Waller, the Earl’s former head of security, whose bank statements were faked by Bashir.Another was sent to Matt Wiessler, the freelance graphic artist, ordered to mock up the statements by Mr Bashir.The BBC said it was returning a number of awards won by Panorama for the world exclusive interview in which Princess Diana told Bashir “there were three of us in this marriage so it was a bit crowded”, in reference to Prince Charles’s infidelity with Camilla Parker-Bowles.In a Panorama investigation into the programme’s own failings 25 years ago, broadcast on Thursday, Earl Spencer said: The irony is that I met Martin Bashir on the 31st of August 1995, because exactly two years later she died, and I do draw a line between the two events.”He said that claims made by Bashir at his first meeting with Princess Diana just over a fortnight later had led her to doubt everybody around her who was “made untrustworthy”.Earl Spencer noted down 38 allegations, smears and lies told by Bashir to his sister and that she had “died two years later… without any form of real protection”.Lord Dyson concluded that Bashir had shown Earl Spencer fake bank statements that “deceived and induced him to arrange a meeting with Princess Diana”.Lord Dyson said this behaviour was a “serious breach” of BBC guidelines.The retired judge accused senior BBC executives at the time, including Lord Hall, later promoted to director-general, of effectively presiding over a cover up by failing to investigate Bashir’s “deceitful behaviour” when questions began to emerge over his conduct in the weeks and months after the interview.Lord Dyson said Bashir had lied three times in insisting he had never shown the faked bank statements linked to Waller and said he was not a credible witness to his inquiry.Lord Dyson said that in 1996 when an internal investigation was launched by the BBC, Lord Hall was wrong to conclude Bashir was an “honest and honourable man… in the light of his serious and unexplained lies” over the mocking up of the Waller bank statements.Lord Dyson concluded Bashir commissioned documents purporting to show payments into the bank account of Mr Waller and also Commander Patrick Jephson, Diana\u0027s private secretary, and Commander Richard Aylard, private secretary to the Prince of Wales.But the former judge also said he believed Princess Diana “would probably have agreed to be interviewed by any experienced and reputable reporter in whom she had confidence even without the intervention of Mr Bashir”.Bashir, who has resigned as the BBC’s religion editor on grounds of ill health, issued a statement on Thursday, the first time he has spoken since facing renewed allegations of wrongdoing six months ago on the 25th anniversary of the interview.In his statement, he said: “This is the second time that I have willingly and fully co-operated with an investigation into events more than 25 years ago.I apologised then, and I do so again now, over the fact that I asked for bank statements to be mocked up. It was a stupid thing to do and was an action I deeply regret. But I absolutely stand-by the evidence I gave a quarter of a century ago, and again more recently.”He insisted “that the bank statements had no bearing whatsoever on the personal choice by Princess Diana to take part in the interview” and pointed to the letter reproduced for the first time from Princess Diana in which she said she had no regrets about the interview and had never been shown any faked statements.Mr Bashir added: “It is saddening that this single issue has been allowed to overshadow the Princess’s brave decision to tell her story, to courageously talk through the difficulties she faced, and, to help address the silence and stigma that surrounded mental health issues all those years ago.She led the way in addressing so many of these issues and that’s why I will always remain immensely proud of that interview.”Bashir had denied much of the evidence given to the inquiry by Earl Spencer and insisted that he had been shown Mr Waller’s original bank statements, which he had then used as the basis for his mocked up statements showing false payments.The Earl denied providing the original statements and Lord Dyson believed his version of events.In the handwritten note from Diana on Kensington Palace notepaper, which was part of the evidence in the inquiry, the Princess said Bashir did not show her any documents or give her any information that I was not previously aware of.She said she took part in the interview without any undue pressure and had no regrets concerning the matter.Lord Hall, who was director of BBC news and current affairs in 1995, has expressed his regret. He said: I have read Lord Dyson\u0027s report and I accept that our investigation 25 years ago into how Panorama secured the interview with Princess Diana fell well short of what was required.In hindsight, there were further steps we could and should have taken following complaints about Martin Bashir\u0027s conduct.I was wrong to give Martin Bashir the benefit of the doubt, basing that judgment as I did on what appeared to be deep remorse on his part.”The BBC could now be facing a deluge of legal claims over the scandal, the original Panorama whistle-blower revealed. Mark Killick, the producer who was sacked within 24 hours of alerting BBC bosses to the forged documents in 1996, said Mr Davie had taken an important first step in commissioning the report but the “generic apology” he had issued did not go far enough.Mr Killick said “like many others” he was consulting lawyers and that several of his BBC colleagues, Earl Spencer, Patrick Jephson, Diana’s Private Secretary, Tiggy Legge-Bourke, William and Harry’s nanny, and other members of Palace staff had all suffered “colossal damage” as a result of the actions of Mr Bashir and the BBC.“What the BBC did 25 years ago sent out a clear message – do not whistle blow,” Mr Killick told the . “That culture of fear they engendered has echoed throughout the years and I believe prevented people speaking up in other BBC scandals.”Mr Jephson, whose bank statements were faked, said: After so many years it is a relief to know more of the truth behind events which had so many unhappy and even tragic consequences.  I am grateful to Lord Spencer, Lord Dyson and the tenacious journalists who brought the story to light. I also acknowledge the BBC\u0027s full apology which I received from the director-general this afternoon.On Thursday, Mr Wiessler said in a statement that “after a quarter of a century of cover-ups and smears, it\u0027s good to know the truth is finally out that I acted with integrity and responsibly from day one. “By blowing the whistle on the deception, I suffered the fate of the fall guy.”The graphic designer, who never worked for the BBC again, said that the broadcaster’s investigation after he raised the alarm “had a devastating effect” on his career and professional reputation.He described the probe as “seriously flawed and a smokescreen to protect Bashir”.Mr Wiessler added: “I hope those responsible for the cover-up will now do the right thing and apologise to me. Tim Davie\u0027s attempted apology is so bland as to be meaningless. “So much damage has been done, not only to me but also to Princess Diana and her family.

As she commented later, “This looks like racial profiling”. But Dr Allin-Khan is a member of Keir Starmer’s front bench team. With Labour in the midst of an identity crisis, with traditional Labour voters (many of whom happen to believe immigration should be tightly regulated) looking sceptically at what Labour has to offer, she comes across – perhaps unfairly – as being sceptical of the merit of enforcing immigration law.Meanwhile in Scotland in the past week, Scottish Labour have been busy giving their support to any illegal immigrant who fancies staying put and ignoring immigration law. An attempt to remove two of them physically last week “disgusted” the party’s leader, Anas Sarwar, while one of his newly elected MSPs, Paul Sweeney, a former MP, endorsed the “civil disobedience” of the crowd of Glaswegians who forced police to release the two men who had chosen to stay here illegally after their visas expired.It should be pointed out that for those at whom these various expressions of solidarity were aimed will have welcomed them. Rather optimistically, Sweeney went on to say that the forced removal of migrants was opposed by a “majority” of Scots, but even dismissing this as wishful thinking on his part, there is a section of society only too happy to be told that they should stand up to The Man and that they should always get their own way, irrespective of the law.It’s when we dig deeper into these politicians’ roles that we start to unearth some serious questions and concerns. In the event of a Labour victory at the next general election, Dr Allin-Khan can expect to become a minister. At which point she will be bound by government collective responsibility. Since it is beyond unlikely that a government of any party could win the support of the electorate while insisting that all illegal immigrants can stay and work in the country whose laws they have spent years disrespecting, we must assume that the next Labour government, like all previous Labour governments, will be committed to enforcing immigration laws.It is as well that Dr Allin-Khan’s tenure as an MP has occurred during a period when elevation to government is only a remote prospect I doubt if she and many of her colleagues would have been comfortable as Labour MPs when her party was in government, when immigration detention centres were in full vigour and the party’s MPs – back benchers as well as ministers – regularly had to defend ministerial decisions that meant sending thousands of people back to their countries of origin against their will.Sarwar and Sweeney’s situation is doubtless a bit easier: MSPs have no responsibility whatsoever for immigration policy and are free to behave like student politicians if they wish, saying whatever their audience wants to hear and basking in their approval, if not their votes. Similarly, Scottish Labour’s self-indulgent decision to oppose Trident nuclear missiles was a popular position to take given that it’s MPs, not MSPs, who make defence decisions.Whatever the differences in political responsibilities, however, it is the common culture and attitude to difficult policy areas that still unite the disparate parts of the Labour Party. Both Scottish Labour and UK Labour have spent so long out of government that few, if any, of their respective front benches have any ministerial experience. They’ve chosen to forget the inconvenient truth that being in government sometimes means having to stand up in front of hostile crowds and tell them they are wrong and the government is right. And then they have to vote for unpopular things in the Commons.Opposition does that to politicians they stop seeing themselves as potential governors and start seeing themselves instead as mere ciphers for whoever in their communities have the loudest voices. That makes life a lot easier.And right there is the problem: too many of our elected opposition politicians want an easy life, where everyone likes them and everyone agrees with them. And the more distant becomes the prospect of one day getting into government, the more tempting it is to indulge the opinions of the last person who sat on you. And so a vicious cycle begins: no prospect of government means MPs feel free to indulge in more populist commentary, while more populist statements make the prospect of winning an election ever less likely. And so on.The tactic feels like it’s working because that comfortable echo chamber seems to like what you say. But then, come election night, you’re reminded that other people, the sort who don’t necessarily come along to town hall meetings or use social media, also have a vote. And when reality bites you have a choice: either be seen as a serious politician with serious, uncomfortable truths to impart, or carry on as you were, lapping up the approval of a tiny percentage of the electorate.The choice seems to have been made already by too many in Labour.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"martin bashir won princess diana lies smears","story":"Martin Bashir, in the words of a senior BBC executive on Panorama, “could charm the birds from the trees”.He used that charm to full effect to woo Princess Diana into giving an explosive interview on Nov 20, 1995. Lord Dyson had another word for it. Lies.The retired judge’s lengthy, weighty report details the scheming and maneuvering undertaken by Bashir, then a relatively unknown reporter, to persuade the Princess to give him the interview.It involves 38 astonishing lies, allegations, and smears – the majority of which Bashir denies every saying – to win over the Princess at a conspiratorial first meeting at a flat in Knightsbridge two months before the interview and includes, a few days later, a five-hour drive to the New Forest and back from London.Weeks later, Bashir was cooking for Diana at her apartment in Kensington Palace. Her complete trust had been gained.What resulted from their burgeoning friendship was television dynamite. Watched by an audience of 23 million people in the UK alone, Diana told Bashir “there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded” in reference to her husband’s adultery with Camila Parker-Bowles.It was quite the scoop, winning the BBC multiple awards and setting Bashir on a hugely successful career path, working for two networks in the US before returning to the BBC and being promoted to religion editor.The pursuit of Diana for a BBC interview had begun in February 1993. Tony Hall, now Lord hall, had written to her private secretary, Commander Patrick Jephson, suggesting that “a respected figure, perhaps Sue Lawley” should conduct the interview. Kensington Palace rejected the offer.Events changed after the Prince of Wales gave his own interview to his friend Jonathan Dimbleby, in which the heir to the throne admitted his adultery and discussed his failing marriage. The chase was back on, and the BBC suggested that Nicholas Witchell, then a diplomatic correspondent and now its royal editor, interview Princess Diana.A meeting was arranged but, before it could take place, Steve Hewlett, the editor of Panorama, decided to hoik  Witchell off the project and replace him with Bashir. Mr Hewlett, who died of cancer in 2017, is no longer alive to explain why.Whatever the reason, Bashir set to work in winning over Diana. His gateway was her brother Earl Spencer, by his own admission an “inveterate hoarder of past records”.On August 24 1995, Bashir made phone contact with Earl Spencer’s secretary, wanting to “just talk”, and succeeded in having a brief meeting at Earl Spencer’s offices in London. It was followed up on August 31 with a face-to-face at Althorp, the family’s stately home. Bashir got to work on his deceit, telling Earl Spencer at the meeting that he was a “target of the tabloids” and that members of his household, including his former head of security Alan Waller, had been “selling private information about him to the media. It was a lie. Earl Spencer scribbled on a piece of paper two amounts, £4,000 and £6,500. These were sums allegedly paid to Mr Waller by News International and an offshore company, Penfolds.The choice of Penfolds was an odd one because it had cropped up in a previous investigation conducted by Bashir for Panorama. Nobody else would have known about the company.Bashir had mocked up faked bank statements, using the services of Matt Wiessler, a freelance graphic artist with whom he had previously worked.On Sep 14, Lord Dyson concluded that Bashir then showed Earl Spencer separate bank statements, this time purportedly belonging to Richard Aylard, Prince Charles’ private secretary, and to Patrick Jephson, who was Diana’s.Lord Dyson admits it is “surprising” that Earl Spencer, “a person who made and kept detailed notes of meetings, did not record the important details contained in the JephsonAylard bank statements”.But in the end he sided with the Earl. “I found Earl Spencer to be a credible and convincing witness,” he said. “On the other hand, there are significant parts of Mr Bashir’s account which I am unable to accept.”In Bashir’s version of events – dismissed by Lord Dyson – that never happened.Bashir then claims that days after the meeting with Earl Spencer, Diana phoned him out of the blue. According to him, it was Earl Spencer who had raised the subject of Mr Waller. Earl Spencer denies that, and the retired judge believed him.Either way, nobody disputes that a meeting was arranged at a flat in Knightsbridge on Sep 19, 1995, at which Bashir and Diana met for the first time, with Earl Spencer taking notes.Earl Spencer was horrified at what he was hearing from Bashir, including claims her car was bugged and allegations concerning Prince Charles and their children’s nanny, Tiggy Legge-Bourke.He told Lord Dyson in his evidence that he thought that the BBC journalist was “scattering these things widely to see where Diana bit and she did bite Legge-Bourke, and the Jephson thing was obviously incredibly worrying. So I think that’s how he learnt to progress those theories.” He details 38 extraordinary smears and lies – Bashir disputes they are all his and suggests this was Diana’s talking – which the journalist threw around the room. “A few days later”, Bashir and Diana took  a five-hour road trip to the New Forest and back, where he claims she raised the scale of payments to Mr Waller. Lord Dyson again dismissed Bashir’s version as lies.In a glimpse into their developing friendship, Bashir later said Diana had retracted her claims against Mr Waller, who has always denied any wrongdoing.Bashir told Lord Dyson: “I was cooking in Kensington Palace, we were chatting about various things, and she said: ‘Oh, by the way, I was wrong about that’ and her source was wrong and I said: ‘Fine’“I think, my recollection, sir, is that she was basically saying, you know, the whole thing was not true, and, you know, ‘I’m sorry, I made a mistake’”.The former Master of the Rolls liked little of what Bashir told him. He had, concluded the judge, had “little difficulty in playing on her fears and paranoia”.Earl Spencer was a “credible witness”, he said, adding: “Regrettably, I cannot say the same of Mr Bashir.”Lord Dyson’s conclusions were brutal: “By his deceitful behaviour… Mr Bashir succeeded in engineering the meeting that led to the interview.”The rest, as they say, was television history. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day idyllic scene ullswater lake district","story":" A paddleboarder makes the most of a break in the clouds to enjoy the beautiful waters of the Lake District at UllswaterHow Martin Bashir won over Princess Diana with lies and smearsExposed: The BBC’s failure to properly investigate Martin Bashir’s Diana interviewDuke of Cambridge: The BBC fuelled my mother’s paranoiaCovid vaccination among under-50s spikes as Bolton fights Indian variantIsrael agrees Gaza ceasefire with Hamas after 11 days of intense fightingBBC reform may be needed after Martin Bashir inquiry revealed ‘damning failings’, warns ministerComment: Boris is fighting a lonely battle against his own officials to reopen BritainBoris Johnson told to cut farmers\u0026#39 red tape to offset \u0026#39damage\u0026#39 from Australia trade dealExclusive: Cambridge accused of creating ‘police state’ where dons can be reported for raising an eyebrowBoth doses of vaccine prevent 90pc of Covid infections, real-world data suggest‘Quite a few’ countries on cusp of green list, says Boris JohnsonA cycle of violence: Where might Israel and the Palestinians go from here? | James Rothwell analysisDoctors hit back at NHS bosses over orders to see patients face-to-faceThere’s Wally – Arctic walrus that visited Wales becomes first of its kind to reach CornwallNumber of offenders escaping prosecution rises 18pc during pandemicFamily fined £200 after migrant hid in car roofbox to enter UKComment: Grant Shapps’s whistle-stop tour of railway history put Labour badly off trackChampagne on ice: Wedding plans face more upheaval with delay to easing of guest limitsComment: I took LSD in my twenties.

The samples were then placed in “olfaction cones” for the dogs to sniff. Nine trained canines were used, several of which came from the fire brigades of the nearby Yvelines and Oise department.They detected 97 per cent of the 109 people who then went on to have positive PCR tests and correctly sniffed out 91 per cent of the negative samples.The animals did not come into contact with the human participants and their handlers did not know which samples were positive.The region’s health department, which contributed €25,000 (£21,000) to the study, said it was “closely monitoring” the results as part of its “Test, Alert, Protect” strategy.Sniffer dogs would not replace the gold-standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests,  Prof Jean-Marc Tréluyer, of the University of Paris, told the AFP news agency. They were, however, “excellent results, comparable with those of a PCR test,” he said. “They could help identify those people who should undergo a full viral test and – because the dogs’ response is so quick – facilitate mass testing,” he added, meaning they could be deployed to busy locations such as airports, train stations and concerts. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"took lsd twenties earth thinking","story":"Do you fancy doing some magic mushrooms?” a friend asked me the other day. I gaped at her in ill-disguised panic. “But – we’re 50!” I squawked. “So what?” she replied, defiantly.So what indeed. I used to love hallucinogens in all their forms: mushrooms, LSD, ecstasy. Some of the happiest moments of my teens and early twenties – more than happy intensely joyful – were brought about by psychoactive drugs. I was never exactly a casual tripper: I only did it four or five times, and being a former Girl Guide I always made sure to pack warm blankets, a snack and an emergency phone number, just in case. Even so, I look back at these youthful experiments with a mixture of nostalgia and panic. “Gosh that was fun,” I think, followed immediately by: “What on earth was I thinking?”A BBC documentary this week, The Psychedelic Drug Trial, made a convincing case for using psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, to treat people with intractable depression. The theory is that hallucinogenic drugs suppress the part of the brain that filters our perceptions in accordance with what we already know.We have learnt from experience that walls don’t wobble, so our brain automatically assumes this to be true of every wall we see. A drug like psilocybin, or LSD, lowers the barriers of our existing knowledge so that our brain can wander more freely and make new connections. For people with severe depression, whose thoughts typically go round and round on the same track, this can be a radical liberation.The programme followed trials done by Imperial College, in which 30 patients were given psilocybin under controlled conditions. After just two doses, these patients reported a faster and longer-lasting improvement to their mental health than the control group who were given traditional SSRI anti-depressants.It was moving to see these people returned to life. “Everything looked alive, colourful and interesting, which is the opposite to how I felt about everything,” explained one women, who no longer feels suicidal.I remember that sensation of acute interest: running warm sand through my fingers, watching each grain turn and glint in slow motion, feeling that I had been given the power to see the world in all its infinite detail. But my own trips seem so self-indulgent now. I wasn’t depressed. I had a perfectly healthy brain. What recklessness that was, tampering with such a precious resource.Psilocybin is a Class A drug, not authorised for medical use. Magic mushrooms – as my fellow 50-year-old demonstrates – are easily come by. Surely it should be the other way around?Great British Railways. What a stinker of a name. We all know what it is intended to convey: greatness, and Britishness. A shiny dependable engine chugging out of the mists of our glorious past to carry us into the future.What it actually conveys is desperation. The very act of claiming to be great looks small. It also invites scepticism. Great? I’ll be the judge of that. Plus there’s the fact that this formulation has already been done to death by light entertainment. It’s just about tolerable when affixed to a TV baking competition or sewing bee. But when applied to a transport network, it doesn’t look like playful hyperbole – just a failure of imagination.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wally arctic walrus visited wales becomes first kind reach","story":"An Arctic walrus known as Wally has become the first of its kind to be spotted off the coast of Cornwall after previous run-ins with lifeboat crews in Wales.Wally the Walrus was last spotted three days ago in Tenby, South Wales, where it seemed to have become a permanent resident, regularly seen lolling on a RNLI slipway.Now a walrus matching Wally’s description has been seen off the coast of Cornwall in Padstow, in what Cornwall Wildlife Trust said was absolutely a first.On Monday, a Tenby lifeboat crew had to use new tactics, including a hose pipe, to get the 600kg mammal to move off its slipway - which is used for life-saving boats in an emergency.An RNLI spokeswoman said lifeboat crews had been getting advice from marine mammal welfare organisations on how to move Wally.During a routine exercise on Monday, the airhorn did not prove successful so the crew were advised by experts to trial a gentle fresh-water hose pipe, which successfully moved Wally on,” she said.Wally had not been seen in Wales since but Padstow Sealife Safaris reported a sighting of a walrus on Thursday. The safari firm wrote on Facebook: This afternoon our passengers and crew were absolutely astounded to spot what they first thought was a very large seal, only for it to pop up and reveal a pair of tusks.Wally is believed to have reached the British Isles from the Arctic on an ice floe, meaning its may have travelled in the region of 2,650 miles. Experts said it was reasonable to assume the walrus spotted off Cornwall was Wally, which must have made the 70-nautical-mile journey across the Bristol Channel.Lucy Babey, head of science \u0026amp conservation at sealife charity ORCA, said Wally had an identifiable feature of white marks on its flipper that experts would need to see to confirm it was the same walrus.“With walrus sightings in the UK being very rare and the fact that Padstow is only across the Bristol Channel from Tenby, it is highly plausible that it is the same animal exploring its environment,” said Ms Babey.Abby Crosby, a marine conservation officer from Cornwall Wildlife Trust, said: It\u0027s absolutely a first and I\u0027m amazed by this sighting.It\u0027s wonderful to hear he\u0027s on our coastline.  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"martin bashir tradesman interview princess diana","story":"The startling disclosure was made in a Panorama special aired on the BBC tonight after a report found the TV journalist faked bank statements to deceive Diana ahead of her infamous interview with him.Earl Spencer suggested his sister lost faith in those around her after being duped into taking part the BBC scoop after her marriage collapsed.What the report found:Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Bashir’s deceitful and unethical behaviour was an abuse of his position and a clear breach of the high journalistic standards on which his former employer prides itself. The BBC then added to the disgrace by failing to investigate properly the underhand tactics used to land the  interview. The whole sorry affair has caused understandable anguish for the late Princess’s family and friends. Earl Spencer has claimed there is a link between the programme and his sister’s death two years later.  The BBC has rightly apologised but its expressions of remorse will count for nothing unless it ensures that such a situation can never happen again. Bashir’s reputation rightly lies in tatters but his personal ignominy should not be allowed to tarnish the whole corporation, which still strives to deliver impartial journalism. Buck passers The Government has set aside £billion for the Covid test and trace system. Despite the eye-watering amount lavished, the programme is still not working properly.  We now learn that technical glitches were partly responsible for the spread of the Indian iant, with councils unable to respond to the outbreak because they could not access the data on positive tests in their area. Yet earlier this week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock implied it was the failure of people to get vaccinated that was behind the surge. This now comes across as an attempt to sht the blame for the Government’s own failings. Instead of trying to pass the buck, ministers should start taking some responsibility.

At , Karen had three sons from another relationship and Rich adored them. But the pair felt they had room for one more in their brood. However, after falling pregnant twice and miscarrying both times, Karen’s mental health was suffering. “It was horrendous. I lost both pregnancies fairly late and Rich and I were struggling,” Karen, now , told The Mirror. The miscarriages brought back painful memories for Karen, who had already suffered the loss of two daughters when she was in her s and with her first husband. Mari, her first daughter, suffered complications in the womb and didn’t survive childbirth. A few years later Georgia came along, but she tragically died at four and a half months old.  Just  at the time, Karen was devastated to learn she and her husband couldn’t conceive successfully after post-mortems revealed both girls had a genetic heart condition. Both desperate for a family, the couple amicably parted ways. “We’re still friends today. We went through so much together and will always have that bond,” Karen says. In time, she remarried and had three sons George, Harry and Archie. After Archie was born, Karen’s  year marriage broke down and she became a single mum, with the boys visiting their dad on weekends. “It was absolute chaos in my household,” she joked. “I was barely ever in the house for all the running around I did!” Then, seven years ago, she connected with an old family friend, Rich. “I’d known Rich since we were kids but we’d lost touch. After his marriage ended we got back in touch and ended up in a relationship,” she explained.  “I thought I was done with kids - in fact, they weren’t even on my radar, but Rich didn’t have any children of his own. “I decided: ‘Let’s try and see what happens’.” To Karen’s surprise, she fell pregnant in her s. But things weren’t to be, and the pair were heartbroken to discover she’d miscarried. After picking themselves up to try again, they were dealt another blow with a second miscarriage. “I put it down to my age, but we were really low,” she described. “It was starting to affect our relationship. “By now I was  and losing hope. I decided to set myself a deadline for my th birthday. If I wasn’t pregnant by then, it wasn’t going to happen for us.” After the final month of trying, Karen bought a pregnancy test. When it came back positive, she was stunned. But instead of worrying about another miscarriage, a wave of calm washed over her. “I just had this gut feeling everything would work out this time,” she told The Mirror. But despite feeling cool about the pregnancy, Karen was less laid back about telling the boys her news.  “I didn’t know how they’d react. We put some scan photos into envelopes for them to open and waited for their reaction.” Luckily, the boys were thrilled at the idea of having a little sister. After a visit to her GP, Karen was prescribed hormone medication to help the pregnancy go as smoothly as possible, as she’d had her thyroid removed a few years earlier. In time, miracle baby Mia was born and Karen’s brood was complete. After a one month stay in hospital for a respiratory condition, Mia recovered fully and thrived with three big brothers to dote on her. “I was a dferent mum the second time around. I was so much more chilled out,” she said, citing breastfeeding as an example. “Mia was being fed through a tube for the first month of her le so once she was out of hospital, it made more sense to bottle feed her. “I breastfed all the boys and I know I’d have been upsetI couldn’t do that. But with Mia, I was older and more experienced, so I knew she had to be fed and that was the most important thing.” In between juggling kids and work with handling menopause symptoms, Karen also finds time to run an Instagram page, @tryingmybestoldermumma and write a blog.Karen told The Mirror: “I started the Instagram page because I realised there weren’t many voices of older mums out there. “Since starting it up, I’ve had so many older mums reach out to thank me for being open with my story.” One issue Karen touches on through her Instagram page is raising a toddler while going through menopause, which started when she was  and Mia was two. “I can’t tellmy exhaustion is normal from raising a child ormenopause is a factor,” she said. “I’m lucky in that I’ve not had mood swings, but I get hot flushes and night sweats. “I also have brain fog sometimes so I have to make to-do lists every day!” Mia is now three years old and is doing well. “She’s such a good child. She sleeps through the night and she’s so happy all the time,” Karen gushed. Big brothers George, Harry and Archie are now ,  and , and they’re incredibly protective of their baby sister. “They absolutely adore her,” Karen said, adding that their dad even buys gts for Mia at Christmas. There have been times when Karen has worried about her age, but she brushes off any doubts. “I am very aware that I’m the oldest mum on the school run and sometimes I worry that Mia might get teased for having an older mum. I also wish my energy levels were a bit higher to run around after her. “But Mia is a blessing and I’m so lucky to have her. I feel like I’ve got my happy ending.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBabiesPregnancyMiscarriageMenopause"},{"url":null,"title":"adults could receive covid vaccine","story":"NewsAll adults could receive Covid vaccine by end of June in fight against Indian iantAs Public Health England data shows vaccinations prevented , deaths and , hospitalisations up to May , the vaccine programme could move to those aged  and over next weekmirrorShareCommentsByMartin BagotHealth and Science editor:,  MAY NewsPeople aged  and over and in their twenties could soon be receiving the jab en masse \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Prof Andrew Hayward, of University College London, warned the UK could be at the start of a “third wave” due to the Indian iant. The Sage advisor backed the policy of shortening the dose interval for older people rather than fast tracking younger age groups. “That really brings it back down to this race against the vaccine and the virus, except the virus just got faster,” he said. Asked on BBC Breakfastthe country was at the start of the third wave, he said: “I think so. “I think what we can see is that this strain can circulate very effectively.”  The Government believes the Indian iant could be % to % more transmissible. At the lower end of the estimate it can be controlled butat the higher end the June  reopening could be delayed. Prof Steven Riley, of Imperial College London and leading the UK’s largest Covid- surveillance study, said: “In the next two-to-three weeks, we’re going to get a really clear signal of how we expect cases and hospitalizations to progress. “I’m not sure that in the traditional sense we will contain the B.. iant. It looks like it is replacing the previous strain. “It’s really a question of how fast that transmission is and how strong it is, and whether it creates a large wave or not.” From June the Government is likely to take advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationbefore deciding whether to extend vaccination to older children. JCVI member Prof Adam Finn, from Bristol University, said: “It’s undecided at this point. I don’t think it’s been ruled out. “I’m optimistic that we are, in particularly in the UK with the high coverage we’re achieving, and the extremely effective vaccines we’ve got, that we can achieve population immunity. “I’m afraid it’s an open question as to whether we need to immunise any children at all. Andwe do, how many children we need to immunise.” PHE data confirmed the AstraZeneca jab is has been around % to % effective against symptomatic Covid- disease. Immunisation head Dr Mary Ramsay said: “Each vaccine dose delivered helps us prevent lives being lost and people becoming seriously ill.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirus vaccineCoronavirusMutant CoronavirusAstraZeneca plc"},{"url":null,"title":"bashirs diana disgrace earl spencers","story":"NewsopinionBashirs Diana disgrace and Earl Spencers death line an indelible stain on BBCThe Mirrors royal editor Russell Myers on one of the most shameful days in the BBCs history, and how the most uncomfortable truth must be the line Diana’s beloved brother draws between his meeting Bashir and her tragic death two years latermirrorShareCommentsByRussell Myers:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsopinionthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video prince-william-panorama-interview-holds-,customFields:,clearance:Network,source:ceaefcdbe,sourceUrl:PA,site:Mirror,brandSafety: Sport and specialist news – passed for ad targeting,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:xCadRV,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The deceit and deception employed by “rogue reporter” Martin Bashir and the “woefully ineffective” corporation was laid bare in devastating fashion.

Diana’s brother Earl Spencer had long suspected the journalist, who went on to win a Bafta, of being guilty of peddling lies to him and his sister in order to gain access to the most famous woman on the planet. No one was seemingly off limits as Bashir was accused of playing on Diana’s insecurities, dragging the Queen and other royals into his tawdry way of doing business. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  Even his bosses turned a blind eye despite suspicions and whistleblowers who came forward, Lord Dyson detailing a “cover-up” that will shame the BBC. Would the Princess of Wales have granted such a sensational interview to the BBC, Bashir or another broadcaster altogether, had Earl Spencer not been hoodwinked in the first place  The odds are certainly in favour of her doing so, such was the increasingly toxicity of her relationship with Charles and the royal institution.

Add to the mix Diana said herself she had “no regrets” in agreeing to the interview, despite the fallout which saw her abandoned by the Royal Family and into the arms of the lover she died beside. But the most uncomfortable truth for the BBC, as it picks up the pieces of one of its most shameful days in its history, must be the “line” Diana’s beloved brother draws between his meeting Bashir and her tragic death two years later. An indelible stain that will last longer than the foul legacy of the Panorama programme.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBBCMartin BashirEarl SpencerPrincess DianaPanoramaRoyal Family"},{"url":null,"title":"cleaner left memory loss after","story":"NewsCleaner left with memory loss after vicious attack by notorious benefits mumMum-of-two Carrie still has concussion and memory problems six months on from the night Annie Marie Fowler beat her.

Carrie Rapson, , still hasn’t recovered six months on from being set upon by Anne Marie Fowler in a “bizarre” and vicious attack. Fowler, who was jailed for  months this week for assault after slamming Carrie’s head against a fence post and leaving her with permanent health problems, had been on a curfew when the attack took place. She flew at mum-of-two Carrie, after claiming one of her daughters had been laughing at her, grabbed her by the head, and repeatedly punched her. Carrie was so badly affected by the attack, she now has cameras around the inside and outside of her home and a security bell, reports the Daily Record. Iaposm not the same person I used to be, and I still think about it every day,” she said. Fowler struck at pm on Christmas Day at Lochleven Terrace, after she was spotted in the street arguing with two men by one of Carrie’s daughters, Daisy.Christmas Day had been really good and I went to bed at about pm because I was shattered,” Carrie said. We knew the lockdown was restarting on Boxing Day and my daughter Daisy had presents to exchange with a friend a few doors up so I said she could go out and do that. As she was heading back with two friends, she could see Anne Marie Fowler arguing with two men, who were fighting. They crossed the road but Anne Marie started chasing them. Fowler, a -year-old mother from Kelty, Fe, claimed Daisy, , had laughed at her in the street.  She followed them into the house and Daisy hid in my bedroom, Carrie said. She came right into my house kicking doors. She came into my bedroom. It happened really fast and my husband ragdolled her outside.When she was out in the drive, she started kicking and punching my husbandaposs car, screaming. Still drowsy after being woken from her sleep, Carrie then went outside to see what all the noise was about when Fowler suddenly grabbed hold of her by the hair, dragged her along the ground, repeatedly punched her on the head and struck her head against a fence post. I wandered out in my pyjamas and bare feet to see what was happening and she grabbed me,” she recalled. She grabbed my head and smashed it off the fence post and wouldnapost let go. Itaposs wooden and metal and I donapost know what broke my nose. My daughter watched everything, all the children in the street saw - it was still early. People were trying to get her off me. I lost lots of hair.” Carrie was unconscious for around an hour after the attack and an ambulance was called. My other daughter had to keep me upright to stop me choking on the blood as I was dipping in and out of consciousness,” she said. She was rushed to hospital, where experts were concerned that she might have bleeding on her brain. I remember being in an ambulance but that I couldnapost give my name or date of birth,” she explained. “I woke up in hospital where I was given morphine and the next place I woke up was in the CT room. The attack wasn’t the first time Fowler had lashed out. In July  she appeared in a viral video after going on a drunken wrecking spree at a kebab shop in Falkirk and causing £, of damage. Fowler flashed her breasts, ly claimed she’d been raped, assaulted a worker and hurled racist abuse during the incident. That time she was spared jail and ordered to pay £ compensation to the owner of the kebab shop Zohaib Arshad, at Falkirk Sherf Court. But after she admitted assaulting Carrie, Sherf Jamie Gilchrist at Kirkcaldy Sherr Court felt a prison sentence was the only appropriate punishment. The sherf said: This was an utterly disgraceful set of circumstances. You chased two children into a home. When parents intervened, you assaulted one, rendering her unconscious. It is utterly unrealistic to consider anything other than custody.Fowler appeared in court by video link on Monday, where she was jailed for  months and banned from approaching her victim for three years. Meanwhile, Carrie has been left with severe injuries that she is still learning to live with almost six months on from the attack. She is still concussed and needs regular medical checks. Her memory loss has already led to her flooding her bathroom and forgetting she has been cooking. Carrie did run her own cleaning business but was unable toto work until February after the incident. She said neither she nor her daughter Daisy have been the same people since the festive nightmare. I couldnapost walk in a straight line, she said. I had nose bleeds and the right-hand side of my head is still sore. I couldnapost sleep so I needed tablets for that but Iaposm coming off them.” Carrie said she had recognised Fowler from her notorious kebab shop attack video when first moved into the area. She must have been absolutely hammered,” she added. If it wasnapost me, it could have been a child. She was gunning for anyone and I was the unlucky one. It could have been a child.” After sentencing, she said: Iaposm so happy, which sounds bizarre. She should have got longer but Iaposm happy. Fe Council were fantastic. They changed the locks on her flat on December  and promised she wonapost be getting housed in Kelty again.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorMore OnCrime"},{"url":null,"title":"doctors baffled little boy cant","story":"NewsLittle boy with mystery condition baffling doctors still cant walk aged twoAlfie-James Webberley has balance problems that often result in painful falls, after using a walker to aid him for the past year, his family are hoping to get him a specialised bikemirrorShareCommentsByVictoria ScheerAdriana Elgueta:,  MAY NewsDoctors are mystied as to why Alfie-James Webberley struggles to walk \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

But theyaposre hoping to buy a special bike that will help two-year-old Alfie-James Webberley, from Scarborough, Yorkshire, become more mobile. Doctors say he could be showing signs of developmental delay or autism but a full diagnosis is pending. Because of his balance problems that would often result in painful falls, Alfie-James has been using a walker to aid him for the past year. Mum, Leanne Webberley says Alfie-James would like nothing more than to join in the fun with his brother and sister and ride a bike.Because of his condition, he is unable to ride a standard bike as he canapost sit upright without extra support and harnesses, Yorkshire Live reports.You can donate to the appeal for Alfie-James here.  Approximately one year ago, I realised when Alfie-James turned one that he wasnapost able to walk, e had no balance and was falling into things said Leanne. He is a very cheeky, happy-go-lucky little boy, who is very determined to do things himself. So as you can imagine he gets very frustrated when he canapost do these things. His family are now hoping to get Alfie-James a special bike to allow him to live his le like other children his age. Having his own bike means that Alfie-James can have the independence and freedom he likes as well as the opportunity to do things other children would his age, said Leanne.  The bike also has health benefits andhe gets tired I can assist him via a parent handle. While the little boy has therapy sessions every week to assist him with dferent parts of his development, riding a special bike would also help strengthen his leg muscles. Unfortunately, the NHS does not cover the cost and the little boyaposs family are now hoping to raise £, to help make their sonaposs dream come true. We as a family would be very grateful, even the smallest amount gets us that little bit closer to achieving our goal, said Leanne.

Alexandros Christou’s behaviour on the easyJet flight from Cyprus was so disruptive the pilot sped up the flight in order to get the plane to touch down sooner, a court heard. Chef Christou also ignored the seatbelt sign, spat at a passenger, and swung a bag at a cabin crew member – missing his target – during the trip back to Bristol Airport after visiting his estranged dad. The -year-old, from Pontypool, Wales, was described by fellow passengers as being “ out of  angry” as he hurled abuse and tried to wrench the aircraft door open, Bristol Crown Court heard.Catherine Flint, prosecuting, said Christou and his girlfriend were travelling back together and the defendant had bought a bottle of whisky at the airport, as BristolLive reports.  After boarding the aircraft the couple argued and he hit his partner in the face. She asked to be moved. Miss Flint said: “Mr Christou was moved to the back of the plane and it was explained to him why. He became very abusive and was abusive to his girlfriend in English and Greek. “He was absolutely enraged.” The court heard as well as threatening a passenger and clashing with the cabin staff, Christou tried to open the back door of the aircraft, uttered vile abuse including a homophobic slur in Greek, spat at but missed a passenger, and threw soap and tissue at his girlfriend. Miss Flint added: “The captain was kept informed. He sped up the flight and communicated with air traffic control. The flight landed at Bristol and was met by police.”  The court heard Christou, of Rhydynos Street, was arrested and tried to chew his way through handcuffs, injuring his mouth. He then spat blood in the police vehicle, which had to be deep cleaned at a cost of £. He later admitted battery, two common assaults, a public order offence, criminal damage, being drunk on an aircraft, and reckless behaviour likely to endanger an aircraft. Edmund Wylde, mitigating, stressed that his client entered an early guilty plea to a single episode of drunken activity on the aircraft. He told the court Christou, a capable chef, was ing to the UK after visiting his estranged father. Judge James Patrick sent him to prison for  months. He told Christou: “This was a petrying incident for those who were involved. Those who offend in this way must expect to receive a custodial sentence.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCourt caseCriminal damageCrown courtEasyJet"},{"url":null,"title":"englands seven worst covid hotspots","story":"NewsEnglands seven worst Covid hotspots all report rise in infections - see full listBolton, Blackburn, Bedford, Kirklees, Burnley, Hounslow and Leicester all recorded increases in the number of people testing positive for the virus as cases of the Indian iant rise  per cent in a daymirrorShareCommentsByDave BurkeNews reporterIan Jones:,  MAY NewsBolton has the highest infection rate in England, latest data shows \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Niamh Foy, , recollected her troubling childhood which often saw her being subjected to bullying as people couldnapost understand why she was unable to speak.Niamh was diagnosed as young as three with selective mutism, a rare type of anxiety caused by problems with the amygdala in the brain, the Liverpool Echo reports. Alder Hey, where Niamh was diagnosed, said people with the condition have an overactive amygdala when they are stressed, causing their speech ability to shut down leaving them unable to speak. The condition causes the sufferer to become effectively mute in environments such as school, going to the shops or playing sports. The -year-old, who now aspires to become a speech therapist herself, said she felt lonely growing up. But despite the cruelty of some classmates, she said she forgives her bullies her as they didnapost understand what was wrong with me. In an interview with the BBC, she said she would feel sad as she watched her classmates play together while she was left alone.That’s the most upsetting thing about the condition - you can understand language perfectly, you just can’t reply, she said. Your voice, and your identity, is stolen from you. But it wasnapost just children that reacted cruelly to Niamhaposs condition. Niamh said as she struggled to talk, adults would askshe was being rude or put her silence down to bad behaviour or a lack of intelligence. She said: I remember being asked aposare you stupid apos by a lot by people in shops or at the park, because I couldnapost reply to them when they spoke to me. Years of speech therapy at Alder Hey, Niamh said, changed her le and put her on the path to recovery. She said her therapist worked with the school to ensure she was treated equally and class eventually understood her condition and started including her more. As a teenager, Niamh wanted to give something back to Alder Hey and joined a team of volunteers made up of young people who have used the hospitalaposs services in the past. Since then she has visited universities to talk to doctorate-level clinical psychology students about their work and develop apps for young people struggling with their mental health. Over lockdown, she has also set up her own online page, aposNiamhaposs Live-Streamsapos where she streams live a couple of times a week to give company to others who might be living alone or struggling with their mental health.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnAlder Hey hospitalAppsEducationHospitalsSchoolsMental healthTeenagersTherapyBullying"},{"url":null,"title":"it turns out im really","story":"AdvertorialIt turns out I’m really good at it - man turns health challenges into sport and TV successHow actor Ekow Otoo went from a teenager facing a debilitating condition to a lead role in The National Lottery’s stunning new TV admirrorShareByLaura Tait:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY AdvertorialThanks to CGI, Ekow is transported into the middle of a Viking invasion in The National Lottery adImagine being a ft in, -year-old man and finding two pizzas too heavy to carry, but not knowing why. That was what happened to Ekow Otoo – an actor, spoken-word poet and model. “My legs had been giving me problems for years I was suffering a relapse and felt too weak to cook, so I’d ordered a takeaway. I remember being pinned to the wall when I took the pizzas from the delivery guy – they were too heavy to walk with,” says Ghanian-born Londoner Ekow, now . Ekow, who now knows he has multiple sclerosis , started experiencing issues aged . “I tried to get out of my bed one morning and my legs wouldn’t follow. After a nap they were fine again, but next time I played basketball I couldn’t run – my knees would buckle and I couldn’t get any speed.” A GP put the issue down to Ekow shooting up six inches in just one year. “They just thought I’d grown too quickly and my muscles were catching up.” MS is an inflammatory disease in which the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are damaged. Slowly the disease affected Ekow to the point he had to give up sport entirely. “I couldn’t even walk two roads without resting on walls.” At university Ekow struggled to get information from his brain to the page. “I think they thought I was lazy,” he says. “I didn’t connect the problem with my legs, though.”  Help and advice In February , Ekow went to bed with a chest infection. “When I woke I felt funny, sat down and couldn’t stand up again. I ended up in hospital with a doctor standing over my bed, saying: ‘This is MS.’ I remember thinking, ‘Wow, there’s a name for it.’ “It was such a relief to have a definitive diagnosis. I knew it wasn’t all in my head.” When he was first given his wheelchair, Ekow was, “overcome with peace”: “I thought it was going to be a massive struggle, but I sat in the chair and pushed for the first time, and it was like all the stress melted away. “It turns out I’m really good at it. I can travel faster than I used to, without worrying I’ll fall over, look strange or have to stop.” Since his diagnosis, Ekow has relied heavily on The National Lottery-supported MS Society which proved a vital source of information and help when he needed it. He has also benefited from sports, including wheelchair racing – mentored by Paralympian Vanessa Wallace – and adapted rowing with another National Lottery-supported organisation, British Rowing. By playing The National Lottery, you raise £M for good causes every week* “Getting back into sport was the first step in finding my confidence as a wheelchair user. I just loved it – I took part in a development programme with British Rowing for a year and, in , won a para-rowing gold in the British Championships.” Ekow has even excelled at acting, and was recently picked to play the lead role in a stunning new National Lottery TV advert, which sees him performing dramatic stunts in his wheelchair.  Thanks to some clever CGI, viewers watch as he is transported from a street corner into the middle of a Viking invasion, before tearing through a museum and then taking off above the city skyline. At one point Ekow is even flung into the air as he travels through a skate park.

However, good friend Serena Williams could also be a contender after becoming incredibly close to the Duchess during their seven year friendship. Meghan has often been pictured supporting the champ at a string of tennis matches. This week, Meghan and Harry celebrated their three year wedding anniversary - and a year on from Megxit, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle look set to stay stateside for the foreseeable future.Aside from the fact the couple have a baby on the way, documents reportedly filed this month provide a further clue that the couple have no immediate plans toto the UK. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex had set up a foundation – briefly and controversially known as Sussex Royal – in July  as an umbrella organisation for their charity work. But now the non-profit organisation, renamed in  as MWX Trading, is being closed down completely. Documents filed with Companies House show the couple made a formal request to shut down the charity on May , .They also appointed a liquidator to supervise the winding-down of the foundation, the Daily Star reports.

Author of the Maeve Kerrigan series, Jane Casey, has a standalone novel featuring a barrister being harrassed by a man she defended. Historical author Paula McClain, feted for such works as The Paris We, makes her crime debut with a book to tug your heartstrings. Peter James, whose Roy Grace saga was recently adapted for television as the ITV drama Grace, starring John Simm, is back with his th entry in the series.For all that and more, read on. And donapost forget to join the Mirror Book Club. The Killing Kind by Jane Casey HarperCollins, £.What is your favourite book  Let us know in the comment section Jane Casey takes a break from the Maeve Kerrigan series for this standalone featuring barrister Ingrid Lewis. Ingrid has endured years of harassment from John Webster, a man she once defended on a stalking charge and who then turned his attentions to her, ruining her relationship with her fiancé and setting fire to her home. Webster is such a brilliantly nasty character that Casey’s publishers would make a fortunethey sold voodoo dolls of him for readers to stick pins in. And yet he might be the only person who can help Ingrid when it transpires that somebody  may be trying to kill her. Readers will be pleasurably puzzled by who and what to believe in this outstandingly good psychological thriller. When The Stars Go Dark by Paula McLain Point Blank, £.  This crime debut from the feted author of historical novels such as The Paris We is a book to tug your heartstrings rather than set your pulse racing. The central character is Anna, a detective who s to the quiet town she grew up in for spiritual recuperation after a family tragedy. One of her childhood friends – now the sherf – enlists her help in the search for a missing -year-old girl. Anna’s investigation soon widens to encompass other abducted children, including some real-le cases sensitively woven into the fictional story as an act of witness to evil deeds and suffering that should not be forgotten. It’s a lyrical and quietly devastating novel. One Half Truth by Eva Dolan Raven, £.  Anybody who wants to know how and why this country has gone wrong over the past few decades could do worse than read the crime novels of Eva Dolan. Her series featuring Peterborough cops DI Zigic and DS Ferreira has shone a fascinating light on how the rich and powerful have plundered the UK for their own profit while scapegoating poor people and immigrants. This sixth entry in the series focuses on the murder of a young trainee journalist who had been investigating the closure of a factory. Had he uncovered evidence of asset-stripping  The anger is righteous and yet the book is also warm, funny and gripping. The Final Twist by Jeffery Deaver HarperCollins, £ Deaver’s thrillers contain more twists per square inch than a packet of fusilli pasta, so the title of his latest is a bit of an in-joke – just when you think you’ve figured out the final twist in a Deaver book, there’s always room for one more. This is the third in the series featuring missing persons investigator Colter Shaw who is reluctantly forced to team up with his estranged brother as he probes a raft of cases – most pressingly, trying to work out the unknown identity of a family who he believes ruthless killers are planning to target. If you read crime fiction to be bamboozled, you can’t beat Deaver. Still, although the plotting is as immaculate as ever, this lacks some of the heart of his Lincoln Rhyme books. The Pact by Sharon Bolton Trapeze, £.  The latest fashion in psychological thrillers is to write about the toxic relationships within a long-standing group of friends – and, it seems, the more privileged and self-serving they are, the better. It’s no surprise, however, that in her th novel the ever-ingenious Sharon Bolton puts a fresh spin on the familiar formula. The book begins with a group of spoiled teenagers indulging in silly dares during their last summer before university, one of which causes the death of a mother and her two children. They all share responsibility but Megan, scholarship girl and group misfit, agrees to take the blame on condition that the others all owe her a favour when she is released from prison. After  years, she emerges ready to call in her debts and the havoc she wreaks in the lives of her erstwhile friends, all now more obnoxious than ever, is deliciously compelling. Left You Dead by Peter James Macmillan, £  Peter James’s Roy Grace saga – recently adapted for television as the ITV drama Grace, starring John Simm as the likeable Brighton cop – shows no sign of flagging with this th entry in the series. There’s a typically clever and convoluted central mystery that begins with a man waiting outside the supermarket while his we nips in for cat litter, never to . He is arrested for her murder but, with no body, the case founders. Meanwhile, Roy Grace faces family dficulties that make this one of James’s most emotionally engaging books. The Perfect Lie by Jo Spain Quercus, £. Spain’s tenth novel starts with a clear contender for opening chapter of the year.Erin Kennedy, happily married to police detective Danny, opens the door of their Long Island apartmentto some of her husband’s colleagues and before you can say “Bent coppers!” Danny dramatically takes his own le. Fast forward  months, however, and despite the fact we know that Dannycommitted suicide in front of witnesses, somehow Erin is on trial for his murder.As Spain skilfully weaves backwards and forwards in time, the novel sometimes lacks the momentum promised by its explosive opening, but it manages to remain thoroughly absorbing throughout.

These words come from a campaign video which was the response from kids at Yerbury Primary School, just three metres from the site. Today, they were backed by Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, whose nine-year-old daughter Ella became the first person in the UK to have air pollution listed as the cause of death on her death certicate, following a landmark inquest ruling in December. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  “Children in London and around the world are recognising the health ­emergency we live in and are taking matters into their own hands – whether it’s asking companies to act responsibly or asking politicians to step up and protect their health and future,” said Rosamund, founder of the Ella Roberta Family Foundation and World Health Organisation advocate for health and air quality. “It’s time for policymakers and companies to listen to what children are demanding.” Campaigners say Ocado’s consultation is a “sham” – as the grocery giant is already fighting the cash-strapped local council, and crowdfunded “concerned residents” in the High Court.  The hearing was attended by dozens of children from the school, carrying banners saying “NOcado!”, who protested outside the court earlier this month as the hearing was streamed live into classrooms. “Ocado has to drop the depot,” Honor Bolton, , said. “We are defending our rights as schoolkids to a safe playground and healthy classrooms. We are fed up of not being heard. Ocado needs to find another site. We can’t find another school.”  Ocado, which often boasts of its green credentials, says the site would be “one of the greenest and quietest grocery facilities in the UK” featuring a fleet of green delivery vans and heavy goods vehicles that run on natural gas, with % lower emissions than diesel.Ocado’s Twitter account reported yesterday that the company currently has just  electric delivery vehicles in circulation nationwide.Campaigners say this ignores the pollution from  staff cars, and the motorbikes and cars which power Ocado’s Zoom one-hour delivery service, one of the purposes of the site.  The proposed depot is right next to the children’s playground, nursery, classrooms and playing fields, as well as local housing. A supermarket spokesperson said: “Ocado is committed to making our site on the Bush Industrial Estate the greenest and quietest grocery facility in the UK, with a % electric van fleet. We delivered to one in six ­households in Islington in .  Had our proposed site been open then, it would also have reduced the number of miles travelled by our fleet by over % for customers in the borough. Our aim is to be the best possible neighbour to the local community, while bringing a faster and more sustainable service to our Islington customers.” Yerbury Primary has been there for  years. Ocado’s site is “literally along theof our whole playground,” headteacher Cassie Moss says. “It’s about health, it’s about ­pollution, it’s about air quality and it’s also about noise pollution.”  Andrew Grieve, a campaigning air pollution scientist at Imperial College London, says: “Children are susceptible to air pollution as their brains, immune system and lungs are still growing. We have a duty to protect children who have no voice in the planning process.” The site’s owner, Telereal ­Trillium, was granted a lawful development certicate by the council in  allowing storage and distribution, and the food delivery giant applied to open its hub two years later. But last October, the council revoked the certicate after campaigners gave evidence that the site had not been used for storage and distribution since .  Ocado’s response was to take Islington Council to the High Court. The delivery giant’s plans come as it expands its Zoom service as part of a joint “Ocado Retail” venture with Marks  Spencer. Fast deliveries, competing with Uber Eats and Deliveroo, will be supplied by so-called “micro CFCs” – Customer Fulfilment Centres. But Ocado CEO Steiner, a former Goldman Sachs banker, has admitted land can be harder to find in cities for smaller warehouse space.

Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  In last week’s trading statement Ocado said: “The first micro site, in West London, Ocado Zoom, is already full, a year ahead of schedule. A second London site has been secured and we are looking for an additional dozen sites within London’s M orbital motorway to support the ambitious rollout plan of Ocado Retail.” Finance chief Niall McBride added that Ocado would love to bring the model to other cities. The result of the High Court case is expected in the next few weeks, with ramications for towns and cities across the UK. Ocado says local fulfilment centres can bring down “last-mile emissions”. But there will also inevitably be more “dark stores” – fully stocked but with no in-person customers – and depots in residential areas. We want our food faster, but the issues facing Deliveroo, and now Ocado, suggest there may be no such thing as having our cake delivered in under an hour and eating it, without consequence.Nocado.org #OcadoVsKids FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnOcadoSchoolsCourt casePollution"},{"url":null,"title":"queen never see archie again","story":"NewsReal danger Queen will never see Prince Harrys son Archie again, royal author claimsRoyal author Phil Dampier added that its grossly unfair that Archie has never met grandfather Thomas Markle amid concerns the Queen will not see her grandson againmirrorShareCommentsByAdriana Elgueta:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video meghan-harry-celebrate-son-archies-,customFields:,clearance:Network,source:ceaefcdbe,sourceUrl:,site:Mirror,brandSafety: Sport and specialist news – passed for ad targeting,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:ZMoTDY,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Government insiders are said to be keen to work with online matchmakers to encourage young people to take their jab when they are invited. It has been suggested that users who have been vaccinated could get a banner on their profile or a tick to signal that they have had it done.According to The , officials believe the move will tackle hesitancy among younger Brits - although it is not yet clearthe sites will agree.A source told the newspaper: As we get to younger people, Tinder and all those apps will be approached to flag the importance of getting vaccinated. It might also give more people impetus to meet up and find love. This is being properly looked at.  The insider said it was an ongoing conversation, but it will be a decision for the . If the blue tick plan does not go ahead, it is possible that the government could plough cash into advertising on the dating apps. Tinder, Hinge and Bumble - believed to the sites the government is keen to work with - have yet to comment on the reports. Users will not be required to show proof that they have been vaccinated, but officials believe it would be a way of promoting the jab, Thereports. Currently people aged  or over are eligible to be vaccinated, but it is not yet known what the take-up rate will be among younger people, who are less at risk of serious illness from Covid-.  The government says all adults will be offered their first vaccine by the end of July.Yesterday Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was up to the public to prevent the Indian iant from blocking the countryaposs progress against coronavirus.He told a Downing Street press briefing: This is on all of us again. We are masters of our fate. By taking the test in one of these areas , by coming forward and getting vaccinated, by behaving with caution - and we all know the things we need to do, especially outside is safer than inside, wearing masks - we can get this under control. But, again, it is something for us to do as a community, and in particular in the areas where we are seeing a faster rise.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnAppsCoronavirus vaccineTinder"},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle harry rarely lock","story":"NewsMeghan Markle and Harry rarely lock horns but are clashing over baby showerThe Duchess of Sussex is due to give birth to her second child later this year, but there are conflicting reports over whether shes planning a baby shower given the ongoing pandemicmirrorShareCommentsByNilufer Atik:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video buckingham-palace-unimpressed-meghan-baby-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:aPVtGKIW,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The Duchess of Sussex was joined in New York by a number of A-lister celebrity friends including Amal Clooney and Serena Williams, for an event with an estimated price tag of £,. But with her second child well on the way, there are conflicting reports about whether she plans a similar bash, or any kind of a baby shower, given the very dferent world she finds herself in two years later. Earlier this week there were claims she didnapost want a shower at all, with sources telling US Weekly she felt there had been too much stre in the world lately due to the Covid- pandemic and that she and husband Harry had more important issues to focus on.  Now though, Australia celebrity magazine WHO claims the couple have dfering views on whether they should hold such an event in a report that completely contradicts the earlier claims. Meghan, , is said to want a party of some kind following the hell of Megxit but it is claimed Harry wants to avoid the attention that the previous shower drew.“Meghan and Harry don’t lock horns much, but they struggled to get on the same page over their little girlaposs baby shower, an unnamed source is said to have told Who. “Meghan argued that she deserved a party. They’ve been through hell and back escaping England with Archie and she’s starting to feel very settled with a good core group of girlfriends with kids around her.” Whoaposs source goes on to claim that the pair didnapost want details of any shower to get out, with Meghan hoping for a private event with her mum and a few close friends. Time will tell which of the sources are correct. But the couple are now notorious for wanting to share information about their personal lives on their own terms so it remains to be seen what details,any, are made public. The claims come amid reports that the palace took a dim view of Meghanaposs lavish New York bash. Speaking in the Channel  documentary A Very Royal Baby : From Cradle to Crown, Omid Scobie, author of Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Royal Family, claimed: I remember speaking to a palace aide at the time who rolled their eyes.They were horried that something so common was happening within the House of Windsor. Scobie admitted the idea of a baby shower was as far from British tradition as you can get. And Ingrid Seward, a royal author, described the shower and celebration as trashy.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMeghan MarklePrince HarryRoyal FamilyMeghan Markle pregnant"},{"url":null,"title":"psychotic life seaworld orca tilikum","story":"NewsPsychotic le of SeaWorld orca Tilikum - forced drugs, bullied and deadly gamesAs horric details emerge of the  death of Dawn Brancheau, the story of the killer whale that mauled her reveals decades of madness and captivitymirrorShareCommentsByAlex Bellotti:,  MAY NewsThe death of SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau in  at the hands of killer whale Tilikum shocked the world \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

When the -year-oldaposs leless body was finally released from the jaws of a psychotic orca weighing more than five tonnes, her head was found scalped - while part of her arm was missing. The experienced trainer is one of three people to have been killed by Tilikum, once the worldaposs largest killer whale in captivity, who continued to be housed at the park in Orlando until his death in .This week, sickening details of the incident have emerged from a police report which recounts how the beast performed a deep e during its deadly game.Dawnaposs horrendous death sparked widespread outrage, as former staff members and activists railed against SeaWorldaposs treatment of animals - allegedly driving them to the point of madness. Captured when he was just two years old and allegedly fed drugs to stave off grim injuries, here is the tragic story of Tilikumaposs victims and his own heartbreaking le. Student killed by aposexcitedapos orca trio Two decades before Dawnaposs death, a -year-old student was also killed by Tilikum and two other whales at Sealand of the Pacic in British Columbia, Canada. On February , , just as the final killer whale show finished for the day, Keltie Byrne - who worked part-time at the public aquarium - was tidying up when she slipped and fell into the pool.  Before she could haul herself back on to dry land, one of the whales had pulled her in. Steve Huxter, head of animal training at Sealand at the time, said: They never had a plaything in the pool that was so interactive. They just got incredibly excited and stimulated. As trainers desperately tried to help from the pool side, throwing a le ring into the water, they couldnapost determine which of the killer whales had hold of Keltie. She managed to reach the surface twice - her terried screams for help echoing around the pool. After  minutes of being thrown around by Tilikum and the two other whales - Haida II and Nookta IV - Keltie bobbed to the surface for a final time. This time, she was silent - the student had drowned. Eyewitness Nadine Kallen said at the time: She went up and down three times. [The trainers] almost got her once with the hook pole, but they couldn’t - the whales were moving so fast. An inquest found that the orcas had prevented Keltie from getting out of the pool and ruled her drowning death an accident. Little more than  months after Keltieaposs tragic death, Sealand closed its doors for good. SeaWorld bought all three of the orcas, with Tilikum and Nookta moving to Orlando, while Haida and her calf, Kyuquot, were shipped to San Antonio. Eight years later, Tilikum killed again. Daniel Dukes was found dead on the orcaaposs back while he was in his sleeping pool. The -year-old had visited SeaWorld earlier that day and managed to avoid security cameras to stay until after dark. He got into Tilikumaposs tank, naked, and when his body was found the following morning, he was covered in cuts and bruises. An inquest ruled he had drowned. SeaWorld aposposter girlapos scalped and mutilated Dawn Brancheau had worked at SeaWorld for  years - quite literally becoming the parkaposs poster girl as one of its star killer whale trainers. A dedicated professional, she worked hard on her health and fitness to cope with the rigours of swimming up and down with the beasts in her care.  In particular, she had a special relationship with Tilikum, also known as Blackfish, who had by now been in captivity for more than  years. Those who worked with her said their bond was strong and based on love and trust. John Hargrove, a senior trainer at SeaWorld at the time of Dawnaposs death, said: We’ll never know why Tilikum made that choice to grab Dawn and pull her into the pool. He had a great relationship with her, and she had a great relationship with him. I do believe that he loved her, and I know that she loved him. It was after one of the parkaposs Dine With Shamu shows on February , , that Tilikum carried out his brutal act. Tourists could watch the action from screens beneath the water as they ate and saw Dawn climb out of the pool. She was lying with her face next to Tilikumaposs - the orca she had spent countless hours with and who had always treated her as a trusted companion. Suddenly, Dawn was dragged into the water. Initially it was claimed she had been pulled into the pool by her ponytail, but there were later suggestions Tilikum had grabbed her by her shoulder.  What came next was truly gruesome. Tilikum didnapost just kill his trainer - the attack was prolonged and incredibly violent. As Dawn drowned, her left arm was torn from its socket, her head was scalped, and her hair and skin were found at the bottom of the pool. Horrically, her spinal cord was severed, while she also suffered from broken ribs and a broken jaw. A post-mortem revealed she died from both drowning and blunt force injury. Chillingly, the captive whale killed his trainer and then refused to release her body. For  minutes, he kept Dawnaposs broken body in the pool with him, despite attempts from the other trainers to distract him with nets and food. Eventually, they managed to get him into a smaller, medical pool, where he was easier to calm and he finally released the body of the trainer. Following Dawnaposs death, Tilikum was sent to spend most of his days in a pool rarely seen by the public. There are reports that he would spend hours on end just lying on the surface of the water. Tilikum died at the Florida attraction in January . Whales aposself-harmed and were given Valiumapos Six years after Dawnaposs death, SeaWorld announced it would end its programme of breeding the orcas in captivity. However, animal rights campaigners have long called for a ban on the animal shows altogether, with former staff members claiming the creatures have been starved, drugged and put under so much stress that they self-harm.Jeffrey Ventre, who joined SeaWorld as a trainer in , told The Sun that the killer whales were subject to intense psychological trauma and even given Valium. “There was a lot of self-mutilation. Jaw popping was regularly seen - itaposs a threat display between two orcas, he said. “The whales and dolphins were stressed and this caused stomach ulcers. They got meds for that. They also got chronic infections, so they got antibiotics. They were also sometimes aggressive or hard to control, so they could be given Valium to calm their aggression. “All whales were getting vitamins packed in their fish. Several got daily antibiotics, including Tilikum, for chronic teeth infections.” Since SeaWorld - which has four parks across San Diego, Orlando, San Antonio and Abu Dhabi - first opened in , at least  orcas have died at its US sites, according to the UK charity Whale and Dolphin Conservation. In the wild, the average le-span of a male orca is  years, while a female usually lives to at least . In theme parks, however, most of the whales die in their teens and twenties. Tilikumaposs decades of trauma Experts told the landmark  documentary Blackfish that they believed Tilikumaposs capture and captivity had rendered the intelligent, sensitive animal psychotic - claims SeaWorld has denied. He was just two years old when he was torn away from his family off the coast of Iceland and taken to a concrete holding tank at Hafnarfjördur Marine Zoo near Reykjavík. There, he reportedly spent close to a year either swimming in circles or floating still on the surface before being shipped to Sealand of the Pacic in . The documentary heard how he was housed with the two older female orcas, Haida II and Nootka IV, who sought dominance, with females being at the top of the social structure in the wild. For  hours a day, the incompatible trio were allegedly forced into a ft-wide enclosed metal-sided pool known as aposThe Moduleapos, where the females raked Tilikum with their teeth in the darkness. He is said to have started suffering from stomach ulcers and was eventually isolated in a medical pool to protect him from the bloody attacks. Former SeaWorld trainer Sam Berg told the documentary: “There has not been a single incident of killer whales harming humans in the wild. In captivity, it’s happened more than  times. “Someone saidyou put a human in a bathtub for  years they’d be psychotic too, and it began to fall into place. I wasn’t training killer whales – I was messing with their minds.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnWhalesSeaWorld"},{"url":null,"title":"man horrified real meaning sad","story":"NewsMan horried by real meaning of sad emoji - and its not puppy eyesA man took to TikTok to put an iPhone shortcut to the test after he saw a viral Tweet that revealed what a popular emoji really means - and viewers couldnt believe itmirrorShareCommentsByPaige HollandShowbiz Audience Writer:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video man-gobsmacked-learns-real-meaning-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:DiLwSiiL,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Yazmina Jade Adler, from Australia, made headlines in  after claiming she relieved her severe period pain by rubbing menstrual blood on her face during a ritual meditation.Now, the Gold Coast business owner has attracted attention again after imposing a controversial policy banning coronavirus vaccine recipients from her Palm Beach salon.Immunology experts say it is scientically impossible for Covid- vaccines to cause illness in unjabbed people as they contain no live virus or any other infectious material that can pass from person to person.Ms Adler told News : It doesnapost really make sense, I guess a lot of people will question that, [but] it is like anything, like the disease or virus, it is spreading [jab particles] somehow and women are reporting side effects when they havenapost had the vaccine. She announced the new rule over Khemia HI vibe frequency salonaposs social media pages on Monday, stating: We are not your hairdresseryou have had the Covid vax.The unknown health effects of the mRNA vaccine are not covered by our public liability insurance, Ms Adler wrote on Facebook and Instagram. She apologised for any aposinconvenience to customers but said the safety of our staff and existing clients is our priority, adding the policy would be re-evaluated in  when clinical trials of the experimental injection are completed. But social media users hit back at her decision. One Facebook user said: I find your business decision ludicrous!! I’m a hairdresser andanything I’d rather my clients were vaccinated, but it’s a personal decision and I won’t discriminate! Another questioned: Itaposs curious to read that so many people who are so vehemently standing up for their right to privacy and standing against a vaccine passport are also asking people to disclose their vaccination history at a hair salon not run by medical experts  More challenged her decision: So just to confirm that the essential health workers, first responders and those working the frontline in health that have to get this vaccine are not welcome in your salon  The businessapos posts have since been flagged as missing context and defying scienceapos by independent fact checkers, the Australian Associated Press.  In a statement addressing the claims, AAP said a Facebook post circulating online claims that countless reports and anecdotes affirm people who are unvaccinated against Covid- are becoming ill just by being in the vicinity of those who have had the jab. The y post lists alleged examples of illnesses and injuries unvaccinated people have picked up from vaccinated people. These include irregular and heavy menstruation, bleeding while pregnant and miscarriages as well as supposed cases of pets dying when touched by someone who got the Covid jab. Associate professor Menno van Zelm from Monash Universityaposs Department of Immunology and Pathology agreed, saying that there are aposno credible reportsapos that vaccinated people can make other people ill. For one, Covid- vaccines do not contain the virus nor any other infectious agent that is contagious, Dr van Zelm said in an email. Yes, the vaccine activates the immune system and can make the recipient feel unwell for  hours, but this does not affect bystanders. Ms Adler, who also offers aposcrystal healingapos and aposfrequency technology and sound healing for your full mind body hair experienceapos in her salon, rose to fame two years ago after appearing on SBSaposs show Medicine or Myth. In front of a  of medical experts, she pulled out a jar of her menstrual blood - which she collects - and daubed it across her forehead, claiming it cures her period cramps.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnGold CoastPalm BeachImmune systemCoronavirusCoronavirus vaccineAustralia"},{"url":null,"title":"lived north koreas secretive world","story":"NewsI lived in North Korea’s secretive world - I was followed, filmed and banned from busesMonitored by creepy surveillance, drawn in by propaganda and blanked by locals, Brit Lindsey Miller lts the lid on le in the hermit state in a new bookmirrorShareCommentsByAlex Bellotti:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Running her hand underneath the flowers on the windowsill, she discovered a blue mobile phone - before an embarrassed waitress hurried over and picked it up. She went back to polishing glasses asnothing had happened, explains Lindsey. It didn’t mattersome measures to keep an eye on foreigners came across as hapless. What mattered was that we felt watched and under control. It was an unnerving reminder of the realities of le as a foreigner living in North Korea, famously the most secretive nation in the world under the rule of despotic dictator Kim Jong-un. Accompanying her husband on a diplomatic posting to the British Embassy in the capital Pyongyang, Lindsey is one of only a handful of Westerners to have experienced le first-hand in the shadowy hermit state.  In her new photo book, North Korea: Like Nowhere Else, she paints a vivid picture of communities kept under the close grip of police surveillance, while also unravelling some of the wider misconceptions about North Korean society. Lonely and kept at armsaposby locals fearful of foreigners, she found herself at the epicentre of a dangerous war of words between Kim and former US president Donald Trump - even becoming deceived by the warped propaganda that lined every street corner. Spied on by men in black suits A musical director and award-winning composer now living back in the UK, Lindsey and her husband were posted in North Korea in . Like any well-read visitor, she arrived in the midst of a hot, muggy summer with her own preconceptions. I knew that a pervasive cult of personality subsisted on air-lted lobster and caviar, while most of the population was condemned to beggary and misery, she writes. I’d seen the footage of goose-stepping soldiers, Cold War-style military parades, ballistic missile and nuclear tests, and the almost comedic, profound yet ultimately inconsequential, other-worldliness of the place. Settling down in the capitalaposs Munsu Dong district, where a tiny collection of foreigners reside, Lindsey was greeted by roadside outposts manned by armed guards and had a constant feeling of being watched. While free to walk and drive around the city, tight restrictions are put on Westerners - they have to be accompanied by authorised personnel on theand in taxis, while buses are off-limits.  Lindsey also struggled to find reliable internet connection and couldnapost call the outside world from her North Korean phone. More unsettling, however, was the constant attention from locals who would openly film her on their phones and take pictures. On one occasion, she describes being followed by two men in black suits at the height of the countryaposs famously harsh winter, watching in disbelief as they struggled for balance on the icy ground. I let it get to me too often, she says. But as suffocating as it sometimes felt, some instances were so ridiculous they simply made me laugh. Shunned by locals terried of guards The hardest part of everyday le for Lindsey, though, was struggling to make friends with North Korean residents. During her stay, she attended the famously dramatic military parades, joined running events and visited a plethora of restaurants and bars - many of which oddly double up as hairdressers, gyms and karaoke rooms. Talking to interpreters, drivers, waiters and cleaners who worked around the city, she found many were fearful of their conversations being misinterpreted by watching eyes - often ignoring or outright rejecting her. One of Lindseyaposs closest pals was a young girl called Min Jeong, an unusually outspoken worker at a local bar, the Myohyang Beer House. But even then, the limits of their relationship became clear over time.  Min Jeong was always unexpectedly candid about how bored or fed up she was,how tired she was of being set up on dates by her parents or being told by her friends that she had to lose weight, says Lindsey. She even went so far as to complain to me about some of the restrictions she endured. When I ran in the Pyongyang K she came to cheer me on, but at a distance from our mutual foreign friends. When I asked her why she didn’t let them know she was there, she just looked at me, widened her eyes and shook her head. ‘I couldn’t,’ she whispered. ‘Too much security. Didn’t you see all the security  Over time, the isolation began to overwhelm Lindsey. She became fearful that those who did try to befriend her had ulterior motives, such as three train conductors who shared noodles with her, only to smuggle packages in her bag to avoid customs. How much could I really trust these people  she says. This question would haunt me for the entire time I was there. I struggled to separate the human being in front of me from their environment. aposI was lured in by twisted propagandaapos As the months wore on, Lindsey also found herself subconsciously taken in by the red and yellow propaganda posters draped across buildings all over the city. Huge portraits of Kimaposs family, which alarmed her upon her arrival, faded into insignicance - but as they did so, it became easy to get swept up by government messages glorying Kimaposs achievements and railing against foreign superpowers. I would rationalise to myself the twisted behaviour of the system and somehow find myself buying into North Korea’s claims of victimisation by the West, Lindsey admits. I’d read translated statements by North Korean state media and think to myself that it was perfectly understandable that they wanted nuclear weapons. Why wouldn’t they when all they wanted to do was to protect themselves   While she soon separated herself from such thoughts, she also found her preconceptions about North Koreans were also wide of the mark.Fellow foreigners eager to tantalise locals with stories about Facebook, Amazon or other details of Western society quickly realised they not only knew about such things, but were far from in awe of them.Foreigners often failed to realise that the Koreans we were speaking to undoubtedly already knew the information we were so eager to impart and had probably been ideologically armoured against it, or at least were numb as to why they should care, she says. Min Jeong told me once that she was fed up with hearing about Facebook and told one man to shut up when he kept going on about the free internet. Terried of all-out war with West Tensions with the West nonetheless cast a dark shadow over Lindseyaposs stay. She recalls one day in September  being jolted awake by the sound of a ballistic missile being tested overheard, flying over , miles from a site near Pyongyang airport.As Donald Trump ramped up his war of words with Kim, the threat of conflict between the US and North Korea became an increasing concern for terried residents - who knew they would be unable to flee.A Korean friend told me they were worried about war breaking out, says Lindsey. They looked at me expectantly, willing me to say something in response. Ordinarily, I would have insisted that the US didn’t see North Korea as an enemy. I’d try and explain that it was their own propaganda exaggerating international responses to their own state’s reckless behaviour – but it was becoming increasingly dficult to do that, given what was coming out of the White House. However, against all odds, tensions began to cool. Trump and Kim adopted a more diplomatic approach, later culminating in the former presidentaposs landmark  visit to North Korea, which saw the two leaders even shake hands. As the hermit state was tentatively welcomed back into the international fold - even competing alongside its bitter southern enemy at the  Winter Olympics - the streets of Pyongyang underwent a face lt.  Propaganda slogans around the city, which had for decades encouraged the nation’s defiance against imperialist enemies, were replaced with more neutral expressions of ‘togetherness’ and musings on socialist construction, says Lindsey. Propaganda posters depicting American soldiers defeated by North Korean weapons and the US Capitol being destroyed by North Korea’s iron fist were gradually replaced with imagery of scientists, students and workers leading the country towards a better future. With the odd exception, state media dialled down its aggressive language. Shops stocking postcards and stamps for tourists suddenly ran out of the angry, anti-American designs, to be replaced by benign pictures of farms, fishing and factories. aposI knew Iaposd never see my friends againapos When it finally came time to leave in , Lindsey was overcome by a strange grief. Having failed to break down the walls of distrust with North Koreans, she nonetheless felt a sadness that the friends she had made would have to be cut out of her le completely. Here, there was no opportunity to stay in touch on Facebook, or invite them over to the UK for a holiday. Even after two years of friendship, I couldn’t break the wall, Lindsey says of those she met. They still couldn’t give the answers it felt like they wanted to give. I had tried to understand this country and desperately failed. But more than anything, the grief and definiteness of leaving behind the Koreans I cared about was the most painful part. I knew I would never see or hear from them again.North Korea: Like Nowhere Else by Lindsey Miller, published by September Publishing, is out now.

It is a fantastic gesture and one that is hugely appreciated by us.”Keiran’s Legacy has helped provide  automated external defibrillators, mostly in public places. The campaign also helps adults and children to improve their health and well-being.Mr Ross was elected to the Scottish Parliament on May  to represent the Highlands and Islands region, which covers Moray.#What his family have done in his name is truly inspirational.## Douglas RossHe already represents Moray as an MP at Westminster, so his pay at Holyrood is reduced from the ordinary £, to £,. The first pay cheque of the new job is lower than normal because of the timing of the election.Last month, Mr Ross said he would not take the cash from his second job at Holyrood and was exploring the idea of a charitable trust.Mr Ross said: “I am pleased to be donating the first month of my MSP’s salary to such a wonderful charity. Keiran’s death was an absolute tragedy but what his family have done in his name is truly inspirational and has helped to save lives.“Their tireless efforts are ensuring that people know what to do in le threatening situations and has placed vital defibrillators across our communities. That is a legacy to be very proud of and I know their excellent work will only continue to grow.“I know that this donation will be put to good use to educate more people in the use of CPR and enable more lives to be saved. I wholeheartedly congratulate everyone involved with Keiran’s Legacy and I am pleased to be able to be in this position to give a financial donation to support their work.“I saidelected as an MSP that I would donate my salary while I also continue as an MP and this is the first local charity that will benefit from the promise I made.”Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/Cerrys-and-Samantha-UO-558x372.jpg ","title":"dundee mum lands gig with fashion label whose clients include miley cyrus and paloma faith","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remA young Dundee mum with aspirations to be a star of the fashion industry has received her first big break as she helps design clothes for one of the country#s biggest retailers.Cerrys Duke, , will be a member of a team producing garments for Urban Outfitters in Edinburgh, after taking part in the successful local project Kindred Clothing.The project, which is run by Dundee charity Front Lounge, aims to provide young mums with the skills and confidence to create clothes for themselves and their children using sewing courses online.Kindred Clothing is soon to receive official SQA accreditation, with Cerrys one of the first students to graduate.And she has since been offered a six-week placement working on the retail order for Urban Outfitters by Samantha Paton, who runs Dundee-based fashion label Isolated Heroes, whose key clients include celebrities Miley Cyrus, Paloma Faith and Kate Nash.Cerrys said: “I started Kindred Clothing to master a few basic sewing skills and to fix things, with Layla at my side, but I genuinely never thought I’d get an opportunity to work on a big design order for a major retailer.“I’ve loved soaking up the atmosphere of a real fashion business. The course and this placement have really boosted my confidence and shown I can do anything I set my mind to.“Kindred Clothing has also led to some lelong friendships – we’re like a family now and we’re all starting to see our potential and imagine what our futures could look like.”Garments created by Isolated Heroes which Cerrys has been working on, including embellished mot sweatshirts, will go on sale next Friday May  as part of a pop-up event within the Urban Outfitters store on Edinburgh#s Princes Street.Fashion label boss Samantha, who has been involved in the project from the outset, believes Kindred Clothing can fill a gap within the fashion industry.“For us, Kindred Clothing ticks a number of boxes,# she said.“We have the privilege of complimenting their skills and experience and, in , we can tap into their talent pool – these are women who are ready to learn, to improve and to listen.“Cerrys is extremely able but also possesses that rare skill of listening to feedback and acting on it. We’ve loved having her in the studio and she should be exceptionally proud of herself.”Cerrys has also been involved in the creation of garments that are on sale within the VA shop, where Isolated Heroes are the exclusive fashion collaborator for the Night Fever: Designing Club Culture exhibition.“Selling our creations within Urban Outfitters and VA Dundee simultaneously is just amazing and for Cerrys to be involved in that is wonderful – she could have a really bright future ahead of her,# Samantha added.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/medw-tayport-football-club-anti-social-behaviour-3_39046835-558x372.jpg ","title":"tayport football club urge for review of public access path after a van was torched within the club grounds","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remThe chairman of Tayport Football Club has urged that a public access path inside the stadium should be closed off, after a spate of anti-social behaviour.Within the last few weeks several attempts were made to damage a van within The Canniepart stadium before it was torched on Monday.Chairman, David Baikie, said there have been a number of issues prior to the blaze, including the stand being turned into a makesht drinking den for youths.The club#s grounds on Shanwell Road are also the home of the famous Tayport Car Boot sale which has recently ed after lockdown.Mr Baikie, a former East Fe manager, said the van that was damaged was connected to the car boot sale operation, as sellers could rent tables and railings from it.#They#ve been captured on CCTV, there were two lads on bikes and they were here with intent to do what they did to the van,# David said.#They were here for hours, it took them so long to get the fire started and it eventually took hold after am on Monday.#From what we can see on the camera, it looks like they were maybe videoing it as the fire took hold. The flames must have been  or  foot high.#This is the fourth attempt on this van in recent weeks, one of the incidents involved primary school kids using slabs to smash the windscreen.#The man who had this van on site has been running this table and railing hire business for the car boot for -odd years and now that#s stopped.#The club, currently playing in the Midlands League, are in the pyramid system to try and get into the Highland League and Mr Baikie admits anti-social behaviour is not helping their attempts to improve as he urged action.He added: #We are in the process of trying to make a raft of improvements at the ground.#We are only one ision away from getting into the Highland League and we need to have a full license to get into it.#This means ground improvements, enclosed ground and a floodlight system.#How are we going to achieve that with a public access path and people coming in and wrecking the place #The public access only came in about  and we#d been on this ground for over -years prior to that.#This used to be a pig farm so there was never any public access previously.#At that time in  the club was told it could lock the public access during matchdays and in darkness.#That would mean a club volunteer potentially getting up at .am to allow public access in the summer and who are we to constitute what#s #darkness# #He added: #This club is an integral part of this community, we have an amateur side, running club, walking football, school sports, local youth summer school all using the facilities.#There are alternative routes people could choose to walk other than coming through the ground.#All we are asking is that a little common sense could perhaps prevail here, close the gate off and help us prevent the vandalism.#Fe Councillor, Tim Brett admitted the decision to have public access at the ground was #odd#.He added: #What happened over the weekend was totally unacceptable.#To me it is odd that we have a right-of-way going through a football ground.#I#ve been down there, I#ve walked it and my understanding is you can walk around the outside of the ground just as quickly to get to the same destination.#We need to start a dialogue with community about this access and find ways to help the club and stop this from happening again.#Fe Council#s Access Officer, Sarah Johnston confirmed that the council is working with the police to support the football club while making sure that the public#s right of access is protected.Police Scotland have also been approached for comment.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-memories-milton-couples-love-lasted-lifetime","story":"A PICTURE paints a thousand words, the old saying goes."},{"url":null,"title":"grew-glasgow-its-best-city-world---alexanders-gallowgate-memories","story":"Earliest memory of Glasgow  I remember being scared when the bombs were dropping on Glasgow during the Second World War."},{"url":null,"title":"louisa-jordan-katherine-watt---great-glasgow-nurses-celebrated-international-nurses-day","story":"WE all have a reason to be grateful for nurses and today is all about a celebration in their honour."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering-janey-buchan-fierce-glasgow-mep-fought-civil-rights","story":" Janey Buchan was a fierce cultural and political activist.

we will also be doing sound effects live on stage.#The show will be performed in a vintage radio studio style.#Some actors will also be swapping hats and doing dferent voices as they#ll be playing more characters.#You#d be hard-pressed to come out and have a bad time # let#s put it that way.#While the actors read through the play over Zoom to get into character, Stephanie said they#d start rehearsing in person just a week before the show.She added: #We#re planning to keep the staging socially distanced.#We#re a professional company so we could work within close range to each other because we would be in a bubble, but we just want to be on the safe side.#With drastically reduced capacity, families and friend groups will be seated in separate pods two meters from other attendees.Stephanie said: #We#ve been very lucky to be in a position to be able to adapt our auditorium into  pods so every household can be be two metres away from any other party.#I hope this immediate distance is going to give people a lot of reassurance.#We are constantly cleaning, we have a fogging machine # we fog between all performances # and we are also wiping down any touchable surfaces, and we have hand sanitiser everywhere too.#We also have a one-way system in place.#People can really book a ticket and feel safe and secure that they are not going to be in a crowded space # they can just get back to enjoying live entertainment and feel quite confident.#While Easy Money will be the King Street venue#s first in-house production, the family show Artie’s Singing Kettle will be the first show performed in front of a socially-distanced audience at Aberdeen Arts Centre on May .Granite City#s first live theatre show since lockdown set for Aberdeen Arts Centre\" title\"#Granite City#s first live theatre show since lockdown set for Aberdeen Arts Centre# #

infrastructure, issue contracts to private firms to run trains, set most fares and timetables, and sell tickets.It has been designed to end the current #blame-game system# between track and train

project.Aberdeen-based train driver Jordan Jack launched the Campaign for North-East Railat the start of April to reopen long-shut stations throughout the north-east that have been closed since the s Beeching cuts.Mr Jack, the co-chairman of the CNER, put forward the proposals after working together with engineers for on them for six months.His group seeks to help bring modern train links to Peterhead, Fraserburgh and Banchory, and to see the creation of an integrated bus service from Banchory all the way to Braemar.Prior to the Holyrood elections, the CNER sought support from candidates, and is in the process of trying to get a feasibility study commissioned – however Mr Jack says he is now seeking clarication on precisely what the GBR announcement means for his initiative.Mr Jack said: “It’s unclear in the documents that have been put out how the announcement today will impact on the future of rail investment.“Particular surrounding reopenings, there’s not very much mentioned, so we’re going to call on the Scottish transport minister to seek clarication on it.“In particular, around what it means for the devolved settlement, and what it means for campaigns like ours, and the future of rail transport in the north-east.“We know there’s cross-party support for rail reopening, we saw that during the campaign and we saw that more widely as well with UK ministers talking about

the current proportion of the Scottish population who have received the first and second dose of either the Oxford AstraZaneca or the Pfizer BioNTech vaccination so far.The table below is an at-a-glance view of the total figures by group.Data on the number of people vaccinated was initially provided in a weekly report from Public Health Scotland, however there was immense pressure to keep the public more regularly informed so on January  the statistics began to be provided each day.The chart below shows the daily numbers of first and second doses provided.The chart below shows the cumulative number of people who have received each dose since the vaccination programme began on December .It#s also helpful to look at this data as a proportion of the Scottish population so you can see how the percentage of people vaccinated grows over time.The chart below shows the progress for each UK country.On January , Public Health Scotland provided this data broken down by vaccine type which is shown in the chart below.The map below shows the available data on the regional rollout of the vaccination programme.January  saw the release of data by local authority area for the first time, which is shown in the map below.Regional data was originally available on a weekly basis but moved to a daily upload on February . The chart below contains data on the daily number of doses provided and the population covered. Use the drop down box to select your area and the buttons to move between daily vaccinations, cumulative vaccinations and the percentage of the population who have received first doses.Similarly to the regional data, data by demographics were originally provided in the weekly PHS report # however on February  they moved to a daily publication schedule.The chart below shows the daily number of people who have had first doses in each age range, as well as the percentage of that population, covered.Public Health Scotland began reporting daily statistics on vaccinations by JCVI categories in mid-March. The chart below shows the percentage of each group who have received their first and second doses.The vaccines are being provided in accordance with the priority list drawn up by the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation .

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past  dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland’s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days. The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best, serving their customers.Re-opening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps to support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain.Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail ConsortiumThe reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints.Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers.Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.Tracey Gilbert, Usdaw deputy isional officer for ScotlandSir,Oxfam’s shops in Argyll and Bute have an urgent need for volunteers to help deal with an anticipated deluge of donations as they prepare to re-open from Monday April .Sales from the first day of trading following the re-opening of its English and Welsh shops were up  per cent on  figures, with it being the most successful Monday ever sales-wise for the organisation outwith Christmas periods.Money raised by the dedicated staff and volunteers in Oxfam#s shops in Dunoon and Rothesay helps fight poverty and injustice around the world providing people with lesaving essentials like clean water and soap as well as the hope of a better future.We know from the last lockdown that people will have taken the chance to have a good declutter and we’re anticipating a deluge of generous donations.Volunteers are asked to give as little as a few hours a week of their time and can take up a range of vital roles, from serving customers to sorting donations and arranging window displays.Each shop typically relies on a team of  dedicated volunteers and one or two staff, with more than , volunteers required across the country.As well as volunteers, Oxfam stores are also appealing for good quality donations.Protecting staff, volunteers and customers from Covid- remains Oxfam’s priority, with shop teams continuing to implement strict protocol, including social distancing, readily available hand sanitiser, masks and gloves for staff, screens at tills, regular and frequent cleaning, closed changing rooms and encouraging contactless payment.In advance of shops re-opening, people are invited to register their interest online via www.oxfam.org.uk # just click on #get involved#.Tom Richardson, Oxfam interim head of retailSir,The demands placed on Scotland’s health service by the pandemic have intensied pleas for an increase in funding for Scottish NHS.NHS funding in Scotland comes from the block grant from Westminster. If huge sums of Scottish taxpayers’ money were not being used to pay Scotland’s share of renewing and maintaining Britain’s nuclear submarine fleet, there would be funds available to properly support the Scottish NHS.

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local wi and  I cannot get G on my phone.Dr Carina Spink, MuasdaleSir,Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun’s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips, owners can help to protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun’s rays.Dr Sarah Elliott, Central Veterinary Officer, Cats Protection"},{"url":null,"title":"from cradle to grave","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in Transport Scotland#s official reply or in recent press statements:If the next landslide, or subsequent ersion along the equally inadequate A, results in a fatality who will be held accountable Who is responsible for the social and economic impact on the people and businesses of Argyll while we wait another  years for something permanent to be done We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament.We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two km of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach.We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.John Gurr, chairman, The Rest and be Thankful CampaignSir,Mental Health Awareness Week opened on Monday May  and we are inviting everyone to #ConnectWithNature to support their mental health.Spending quality time in and around nature can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of positivity, and you don’t have to be surrounded by fields or have to take a walk in the wilderness to feel the benefits.The Mental Health Foundation, which works to prevent mental health problems and has organised this awareness week for the past  years, encourages you to recognise and grow your connection with nature by sharing a photo, video or sound recording with your family and friends, and on your social media.Connecting with nature can really make a dference to your mental health, and now more than ever, it is time to look after yours.Julie Walters, actorSir,Alan Reid, Dunoon"},{"url":null,"title":"new crop of msps welcomed","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I was really pleased to find a company that does dehydrated vegan food in compostable bags, so I bought  meals and have mailed them in batches to post offices around the country so I can collect them as I travel.#As far as training for such an extraordinary expedition is concerned, Ben explained that he has participated in several endurance events, including multi-day running, in the past, but, now three weeks since he left his starting point of Glasgow he is enjoying this trip more than these previous competitions.#I’m loving this as it’s not all ‘Go, Go , Go’. I want to be able to sit back and take time and explore all the dferent parts of the coast. This trip has given me time to write, which is something I’ve wanted to do for a while.#Ben’s blog can be read on his website where he has also written in detail about the threat plastic litter poses to marine le and the environment in general.#I wasn’t brought up by the sea I’m from Manchester,# Ben adds. #I worked at a youth hostel in Ullapool for a couple of years and felt a connection there.#When I’m picking up rubbish on beaches I feel really up and down about it all.#I feel so sad about what I find, and also about the amount that’s below the ocean’s surface. But then I realise I need to do what I can.#On that note, Ben is keen to work together with locals who want to make a dference.He is helping out at a beach clean in Oban this Friday, May . Information on this and how to donate to the John Muir Trust or the Marine Conservation Society can be found on Ben’s www.ukcoastjourney website."},{"url":null,"title":"lots to do for new argyll and bute msp","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

So, throw open your windows, stock up on blossom-scented cleaning supplies and follow my steps for freshening up your home for spring hellipDeep clean and declutter:Spring is the perfect time to assess your home and see what you can donate or throw out. Irsquove made multiple trips to the recycling centre lately and it really has made a dference to my home ndash I know Irsquoll never be a minimalist, but it feels calming to have a little less clutter at least.Set aside an hour or so once a week to clear out your wardrobe, kitchencabinets and hallway cupboards.Reorganise sideboards and shelves, and get rid of anything you havenrsquot used or worn in a while ndash be ruthless! Then give everything a once-over as you go ndash spring cleaning is good for the soul.Have a room refresh:Changing the layout of a room and giving your home a bit of a rejig does wonders for making the space feel like new. Once or twice a year Irsquoll consider how I can switch up my spaces. Irsquoll move furniture, swap out soft furnishings, relocate the sofa to another position or change our spare room completely. Irsquoll even rework the gallery walls and artwork around my home. Itrsquos like redecorating but without spending a penny.Bring the outdoors:in Stock up on tulips, daffodils and peonies, and place bouquets around your home ndash on mantelpieces, sideboards, kitchen worktops and coffee tables. Irsquom a big fan ofgreenery in the home too ndash plants like Pothos, Monstera deliciosa and ZZ plants are so easy to take care of and really breathe a bit of le into a room. Irsquom all about the indoor jungle, so go wild with blooms and plants and your home will feel bright and breezy in no time.Consider a lick of paint:With so many fun paint brands launching lately , itrsquos easier than ever to add colour to your le. Opt for a fresh eucalyptus green to revive a bathroom, or pick a played-down pink for warmth. Go wild with it ndash paint a feature wall in your living room or section off a room with a dado rail and paint the lower section a bright shade.

It will help protect the people around you, and help us avoid anotherto lockdown.\"It may be tempting to think as vaccinations increase and cases drop, that testing will become less important.\"In fact, this will only make it more important to spot and prevent new outbreaks as cases emerge.\"We know from our experience of last summer just how quickly one outbreak can lead to another.\"This also applies regardless of whether you have been vaccinated or not.\"While the latest evidence suggests vaccines provide a high level of protection against the effects of Covid-, they dont yet provide a guarantee that you cant still get the virus or pass it on to others.\"How do I take a test Follow these stepsyoursquore doing a rapid LFD test at home.Read the instructions that come with your test kit.Clean and dry a flat surface and wash or sanitise your hands before you start.Once you have removed the test strip from its packet, start the test within  minutes.Carefully open the extraction buffer sachet tube.Open the extraction tube and pour in all the liquid.Close the cap and put the extraction tube in the holderBlow your nose.Clean your hands again.Remove the swab from the packet. Do not touch the fabric tipof the swab.Open your mouth wide and rub the fabric tip over both tonsils . Do this  times on each side. Itrsquos normal to find this a bit uncomfortable.Using the same swab, insert it up your nostril until you feel resistance.Rotate the swab in your nostril  times.Pick up the extraction tube, open the lid and place the fabric tip of the swab in the fluid in the tube.Firmly press the swab against the bottom-inside of the tube and rotate it around for  seconds. Itrsquos important to mix thoroughly.Pinch the tube as you remove the swab and put the nozzle cap on.Squeeze the extraction tube to place two drops of fluid on the test strip. Watch out for any air bubbles.Set a timer for  minutes and leave the test strip on a clean, flat surface.Once your test is complete, place all used test kit contents in the waste bag provided and put this in your bin.Where testing takes place - community testing sitesIfyou do not have coronavirus symptoms but live in a community that has been targeted for testing, you can access a test at a rapid test site.These are only available in some parts of Scotland.You can usually just turn up and do not need to book in advance ndash but you should check the arrangements at your local site first.You will be tested using a lateral flow devicewhich involves taking a swab or saliva sample.You should usually get your result within an hour.Island testingThe First Minister also added that people visiting the islands should take two lateral flow tests before travelling.Nicola Sturgeon said: \"We are keeping island communities at the same level as the rest of the country at the moment, so that we can allow travel between island communities and the rest of Scotland.\"But we know this does create a risk for our island communities.\"Many of them currently have very, very low rates of Covid.\"And they will be welcoming visitors from parts of Scotland which I know many of them are looking forward to where Covid will still be circulating at a higher level and more widely.\"So If you are planning to travel to an island we do encourage you to take two lateral flow tests before you depart.\"The second test should be on the day that you are planning to travel, and the first should be three days before you travel.\"That means thatyou test positive, you have a chance to take a PCR test - which is more sensitive - to confirm the result before making a final decision on cancelling your visit.\"This is potentially an important way in which we can minimise the risk, of bringing Covid into island communities while nevertheless allowing our island communities the benefit of opening up again to visitors.\"Soyou are planning on travelling to an island over the course of next week, it is possible to get tests from today, and I would encourage you to do that.\""},{"url":null,"title":"times-league-table-borders-high-schools-appear-top-50","story":"A LEAGUE table of Scottish secondary schools has been published by The Timesndash and the Borders has two in the top .The newspaper creates rankings every year based on the proportion of pupils achieving five or more Highers.This years editionwas published in print on Wednesday, May , showing a total of  schools in the country.GalashielsAcademy has risen by more than  places compared with last years chart.The Elm Row school is now in th place ndash up from last yearrsquos finish of th, as reported in the print edition of The Times.: Talented executive director is leaving Scottish Borders Council for new jobAccording to the latest statistics,  per cent of Gala Academy pupils achieved five or more Highers in .That is up on , which saw  per cent of Gala pupils complete the feat.In this yearrsquos table, only Earlston High Schooland Peebles High Schoolfinished above Gala Academy among the high schools in the Borders.Sixty-seven per cent of pupils at Earlston managed five or more Highers in , an increase of  per cent on rsquos figure .Meanwhile,  per cent of Peebles High pupils achieved five or more Highers last year, up from  per cent in .: Historic mansion near Borders saved from demolition following outcry over plansThe other Borders schools named in the rankings were Jedburgh Grammar School , Selkirk High School , Berwickshire High School , Kelso High School , Eyemouth High Schooland Hawick High School .As a region, the Borders council area was th in a league table of Scottish councils after . per cent of pupils graduated with five or more Highers.That is a . per cent increase on rsquos figure .A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: \"There is a lot of good work going on right across the nine high schools in the Borders and it should be noted that there are a number of dferent ways of measuring the health and success of a school.\"The top performing school in the latest table based on this metric was Jordanhill School, Glasgow, which recorded an  per cent success rate of pupils recording five or more Highers.The lowest performing school was Craigroyston Community High School, Edinburgh, which recorded nine per cent of pupils achieving the feat."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-vaccine-passport-scheme-announced-scotland","story":"A new scheme that will allow Scots to prove they have been vaccinated against coronavirus before travelling abroad has been launched by the Scottish Government.Those who have been vaccinated can download a letter from the NHS Inform patient website, or request a letter from the Covid Status Helplinethey are not online.But as details of the vaccination status scheme were announced, Scotlandrsquos Chief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith urged people to be \"highly cautious about international travel\"and ldquocontinue to limit their travel abroad.Only those travelling to a country where proof of vaccination is needed as an entry requirement should request a letter.There are currently no countries that require travellers to show their vaccination status, but the letter scheme is being introduced because international travel requirements can change quickly during the pandemic.What to do before going abroad:If yoursquore planning to travel abroad, you must:check whether a country yoursquore travelling to is on the red, amber or green listconfirm what you need to do when you arrive back in ScotlandCountries may move between the green, amber and red lists at short notice.You should not assume that a country on the green, amber or red list now will remain on the same list over the weeks and months ahead.Before you travelYoull also need to:have taken a coronavirus testin the threedays before you begin your journey to Scotland -

Eight designs will be chosen to become stamps which will be on sale across the UK.Children may choose to illustrate frontline workers in health or social care.They may want to celebrate other key workers who have kept the country going, such as refuse collectors, cleaners, teachers, supermarket workers, public transport staff, delivery drivers or, indeed, postmen and postwomen.Or they might highlight the volunteers who have helped in their local communities or raised money for charity, such as the late Captain Sir Tom Moore.The competition is open until Friday May . A special  of judges will select the winners. As with all special stamps, the final eight designs will be sent to HM The Queen before they can be printed and issued as stamps. The winners will be announced in the autumn.We cannot wait to see who children choose to honour on their stamp. The past year has been very dficult for everyone, so let#s show the heroes of the pandemic just how much we appreciate what they have done for us.Full details can be found at www.royalmail stampcompetitionAs a coalition of leading providers of care and support to vulnerable children and young people, we welcome the consensus there is between the major political parties in the Scottish Parliament election to tackling the growing mental health crisis in our young people.We have for some time raised concerns over a potential lost generation of vulnerable children and young people, whose mental health is being impacted even further by the Covid- pandemic.The commitment by the political parties to focus on mental health, increasing investment in support services and intervention strategies, is therefore to be appreciated and must be a priority for the next parliament.Our children are remarkably resilient, but the frightening statistics on the deteriorating mental health of many of them presents a compelling case for a national crusade to address what is a mental health pandemic, underpinned by considerably greater resourcing.This mental health crisis is one we can address, but it will require a similar energy and commitment to that which was demonstrated for Covid-we are to achieve this and prevent many young people giving up on their futures – and themselves.The British Hedgehog Preservation Society is asking people create their very own haven for the UK#s only spiny mammal this Hedgehog Awareness Week, from May -.Gardens are a stronghold for hedgehogs, and we can make their lives so much easier with very little effort.Tips will be given out on our social media accounts during the week using #hedgehogweek with daily competitions to win hedgehoggy prizes.There are many things we can all do to help hedgehogs.

Their father Stephen, aged , is in his th year of service with the crew.His father Robert is now aged  and, before retiring, he served  years and his father, the late Robert Scally senior, served for  years.The sea is in the Scally family blood Stephen senior, who is also the Campbeltown harbour master, was a fisherman, as was his father.#My grandfather was a fisherman and he met my grandmother at Mallaig, where she was one of the herring lasses who followed the fishing fleet as it followed the herring around the coast,# said Stephen senior. #Her family came from Peterhead and all her brothers were fishermen.#None of the latest generation of Scallys to serve is a fisherman.Between them, the Scally family have served on Campbeltown leboats City of Glasgow, City of Glasgow II, Walter and Margaret Cooper and Ernest and Mary Shaw.Stephen Scally senior and Robert Scally are both recipients of the institute#s bronze medal for bravery and both are qualied coxswains.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOGerman giant to call in the Wee ToonGermany#s flagship passenger cruise ship is to visit Campbeltown next summer with up to  passengers on board, it was revealed this week.The Hamburg-based MS Europa will be docking in the town for six hours on Wednesday July  next year, during a voyage around the British Isles.The cruiser, owned by German shipping firm Hapag-Lloyd, is  metres high and nearly  metres long.It carries between  and  passengers.It will dock in the loch around midday and leave for Oban at pm. Campbeltown Harbour Office said that the Europa was #arguably the biggest boat to come into Campbeltown for a long time#.The chairperson of Campbeltown Community Council, Mrs Nancie Smith, hoped a special gala day could be organised to mark the ship#s visit.She said: #This is an opportunity we should grasp with both hands. I anticipate there will be some form of civic entertainment laid on.#Mrs Smith added that she hoped many shops in the centre of town would not close for the half day to make the visitors feel welcome.She told the Courier: #It is important that the visitors see the town looking at its best and we hope this will be supported by all the businesses and shops which will stay open for business that day.#The local director of Argyll, the Isles, Loch Lomond, Stirling and the Trossachs Tourist Board, Mr Bruce Urquhart, hailed the Europa#s planned visit as a great opportunity for Campbeltown.FIFTY YEARS AGOFarmer#s heroic effort to save barnFire dealt a cruel blow to a local farmer yesterday afternoon, for the second time in three years.As fire fighting units raced from Campbeltown, a barn at Low Tirfergus Farm near Drumlemble was ablaze from end to end. Flames were fanned by a fresh easterly breeze.And despite a heroic effort by the farmer, Mr Roderick Morrison, son-in-law of the farm#s owner Mr A Barker, the fire had a firm hold by the time the fire brigade arrived.The alarm was raised by Mr Morrison#s we who alerted him.Armed with a pitchfork, Mr Morrison tried to separate the blazing straw, which was being used as feeding, from the rest of the barn#s contents, but it was in vain.Firemen had to jump clear as the roof caved in with a tremendous crash.The straw inside the barn was totally destroyed.The £ barn was erected three years ago after  tons of hay and  tons of straw were destroyed in a blaze at the same farm.It stood on its own, some distance from the other farm buildings.Labour back in control – by one seatLabour retained control of Campbeltown Town Council at Tuesday#s municipal elections, though they lost one seat to the Progressives.The composition of the council now reads: Labour nine seats, Progressive eight seats.Provost Daniel McKinven and Councillor Edward Scragg, who formerly sat under the Independent Socialist and SBP banners respectively, fought the contest as Progressives. Both were re-elected.And -year old William Crossan, of Kinloch Road, Campbeltown, became the youngest member ever to sit in the council chambers.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCoal strikeAttention should be paid to the announcement in our advt. columns regarding the pressure of gas from the local works, special arrangements commencing on Saturday night with the object of conserving the stock of coal.A coal laden schooner, carrying about  tons of household coal, which arrived here just at the beginning of the coal strike and was prohibited from discharging by the customs authorities, had the embargo removed this week, the cargo being transferred to one of the local coal merchants.One hundred tons dished out in half-cwt lots, which is the household allowance for a week, will help a bit to keep the home fires burning.The coal fight drags on without the smallest sign of either side giving way. Apparently the nation will have to suffer much more before a settlement is reached, and unfortunately there is no very clear guarantee that even a settlement of the coal dispute would restore us to anything like prosperity.Every minute of the clock-round stocks are being reduced, andthe dispute lasts much longer, the miners will produce a general lock-out of their fellow-workers, which will have all the dire effects of a general strike without any of its heroics.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday joanne","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We decided this is something we can do safely, while also making the community smile, just like the previous flock did, eight whole years ago.#Please get in touchyou would like further details.#To find out how to get involved with the latest #flamingo flocking# campaign, email Agnes Stewart on Ags@yahoo, telephone   or contact the @CGSGambia Facebook page."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The shutdown means the loss of nine jobs at the plant, but local farmers believe the knock-on effect on employment will be even worse.Farmer and shareholder in the company Tony Archibald said: #It could mean the loss of another job on every dairy farm, not to mention the milk tanker driver.#The farmers are looking at ways of opening the creamery. It is very important because it is the one thing we have as a raw material for over here.#The farmers were due to meet as the Courier went to press to discuss ways of re-opening the creamery and they also plan to meet representatives of Scottish Milk.Mr Coffield described the closure as #devastating#. He said: #There#s not a lot of work round here. The main feeling about the place is disbelief.#The creamery produced about  tonnes of cheese a year.FIFTY YEARS AGOColour TV comes to CampbeltownColour television is to be launched in Campbeltown next Tuesday by Redfusion.And to mark the occasion, Redfusion is staging a demonstration exhibition in the town#s White Hart Hotel, where about six sets will be on view.The exhibition will be open to the public for three days.

I am grateful to the Courier reviewer and to the other reviewers in the BBC, ITV and papers from Stornoway to London for giving it such a good start.#My advice to young authors  Stick at it. The first  books are the worst!#His latest book for children, Super Nova and the Frozen Man, is also doing well in hard cover and paperback. Most of Angus#s books are published in European countries, and some in America, but only the other day he heard this one is being published in Japan.#I#d rather have heard that my golf handicap is coming down, but that would be even more of a miracle.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOPlease noteThe change in the publishing day of the Courier to Thursday of each week instead of Friday has proved so acceptable to readers, particularly to the large number resident outside the district, that we have resolved to make the arrangement a permanent one.Sparks and flashesA meeting will be held in the Town Hall on Friday evening with the object of forming a branch of An Comunn Gàidhealach in Campbeltown.Neil M#Bain is among the latest of the Ayr United Football Club players to fix up for another season.

We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report. Conducting a geological survey which will take eighteen months to complete, a process that could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides. It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment. This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside, or people#s homes, you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at RABT.What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The live action and CGI film tells of Peter#s latest adventures, this time out of the garden, where he finds himself in a world where mischief is appreciated, but soon his family comes to bring him home.Also hitting the big screen when the cinema reopens is the new part-live action and part-animated Tom and Jerry – the latest tale of the renowned mayhem-causing cat and mouse – and action-smash-fest Godzilla vs. Kong, a sequel to Godzilla: King of the Monsters and Kong: Skull Island.Coming in the next few weeks will be Nomadland, Minari, The Father, and A Quiet Place II.Alongside the newer films, the cinema has also rescheduled its #Thirty Films to See Before You#re Thirty# season, kicking off with Trainspotting and The Goonies.Ellen added: #Along with social distancing please ensure to wear your mask at all times in the building, except when eating and drinking in your cinema seat.#"},{"url":null,"title":"clarification 3","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I was really pleased to find a company that does dehydrated vegan food in compostable bags, so I bought  meals and have mailed them in batches to post offices around the country so I can collect them as I travel.#As far as training for such an extraordinary expedition is concerned, Ben explained that he has participated in several endurance events, including multi-day running, in the past, but, now three weeks since he left his starting point of Glasgow he is enjoying this trip more than these previous competitions.#I’m loving this as it’s not all ‘Go, Go , Go’. I want to be able to sit back and take time and explore all the dferent parts of the coast. This trip has given me time to write, which is something I’ve wanted to do for a while.#Ben’s blog can be read on his website where he has also written in detail about the threat plastic litter poses to marine le and the environment in general.#I wasn’t brought up by the sea I’m from Manchester,# Ben adds. #I worked at a youth hostel in Ullapool for a couple of years and felt a connection there.#When I’m picking up rubbish on beaches I feel really up and down about it all.#I feel so sad about what I find, and also about the amount that’s below the ocean’s surface. But then I realise I need to do what I can.#On that note, Ben is keen to work together with locals who want to make a dference.He is helping out at a beach clean in Oban this Friday, May . Information on this and how to donate to the John Muir Trust or the Marine Conservation Society can be found on Ben’s www.ukcoastjourney website."},{"url":null,"title":"new member makes his mark at dunaverty","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Irsquove made multiple trips to the recycling centre lately and it really has made a dference to my home ndash I know Irsquoll never be a minimalist, but it feels calming to have a little less clutter at least.Set aside an hour or so once a week to clear out your wardrobe, kitchencabinets and hallway cupboards.Reorganise sideboards and shelves, and get rid of anything you havenrsquot used or worn in a while ndash be ruthless! Then give everything a once-over as you go ndash spring cleaning is good for the soul.Have a room refresh: Changing the layout of a room and giving your home a bit of a rejig does wonders for making the space feel like new. Once or twice a year Irsquoll consider how I can switch up my spaces. Irsquoll move furniture, swap out soft furnishings, relocate the sofa to another position or change our spare room completely. Irsquoll even rework the gallery walls and artwork around my home. Itrsquos like redecorating but without spending a penny.Bring the outdoors: in Stock up on tulips, daffodils and peonies, and place bouquets around your home ndash on mantelpieces, sideboards, kitchen worktops and coffee tables. Irsquom a big fan ofgreenery in the home too ndash plants like Pothos, Monstera deliciosa and ZZ plants are so easy to take care of and really breathe a bit of le into a room. Irsquom all about the indoor jungle, so go wild with blooms and plants and your home will feel bright and breezy in no time.Consider a lick of paint: With so many fun paint brands launching lately , itrsquos easier than ever to add colour to your le. Opt for a fresh eucalyptus green to revive a bathroom, or pick a played-down pink for warmth. Go wild with it ndash paint a feature wall in your living room or section off a room with a dado rail and paint the lower section a bright shade.

Itrsquos not so far, but it might be a bit dficult to reach, Irsquove never explored it before.Finn wasnrsquot sure.Izzy helped him decide: ldquoIt might have a connection to the original Merlin.That sold it to him.ldquoWell, I have my boots, he smiled, ldquocan I lead the way So they set off in the direction of Coille Coire Chuic, a small remnant of the ancient Caledonian forest. Izzy let Finn decide on the route and as they neared the wood they arrived at the River Cononish. There was no obvious and safe way to cross, but Izzy was sure there was a small bridge downriver.The route got increasingly boggy and Izzy suspected Finn may want to give up, but instead he took the role of leader seriously and carefully planned each step, identying dryer patches and helping his aunt. They made slow progress, but with much hilarity as they balanced on small tufts of dry land surrounded by bog myrtle.Finn paused and listened. The noise of a waterfall could be heard ahead and he aimed for it. Izzy lagged behind to take in the beauty of the heather, which carpeted the ground with a blaze of purple and pink. The old Scots pines on the other side of the river looked magnicent, framed by the mountains beyond.She caught up with Finn, who was sitting on a rock watching the waterfall. It cascaded into a hidden pool, where the water twirled and bubbled asin a giant cauldron. Scots pine trees stood guard on the edge of it, one growing precariously from the overhanging rocks, its trunk curving upwards so its higher branches reached the sunlight. A gnarled rowan with vivid berries grew from the rocks on the other side, while on the opposite bank birch trees clung onto the steep side of the river, bent over like weeping willows.Finn wanted to sit awhile and so Izzy took it as an opportunity to make a brew for them both. He was beginning to understand that using her small camping stove was an important ritual for his aunt: the hissing sound, the waiting, the trail of steam, the anticipation it made a warm feeling, turned a wild place into home.They sipped tea together and shared well-earned snacks. Finn waited, expecting his aunt to tell a story. Finally, she did.ldquoSee that giant boulder over there, Finn, it was dropped by the giants who sculpted this land many years ago.ldquoLike with Samsonrsquos stone we saw Izzy nodded.Finn raised a cynical eyebrow and half a smile.ldquoHuge giants, Finn, a race called the Fomorians. The legend says they emerged from the sea long ago ndash grotesque troll-like creatures, incredibly powerful and cruel. Two of them made Rannoch Moor their home and they terrorised the people for miles around, destroying homes and taking livestock.ldquoNobody knew what to do, even the bravest and best warriors were defeated by them, ripped apart without mercy. Then a young lad about your age had his home destroyed by one of the giants, and in his grief he decided to rid the land of them.ldquoBut how could he do thateven the best warriors couldnrsquot Izzy gave him a wry smile, which he knew meant that was a good question and that she was just about to answer it.ldquoThe lad was wise. He had noticed how the two giants argued with each other about who was the stronger.ldquoSo he got them to fight each other ldquoKind of, he persuaded them to have a competition to see who could throw a stone furthest. They began hurling bigger and bigger stones, then they tore chunks of rock off the mountain sides. Soon the land was littered with boulders, and after three days the two giants were utterly exhausted.ldquoThen the young lad told one of the giants he had won, for he knew this would cause a fight. And so it did.ldquoThe giants fought each other with fury, using up what energy they had left. Finally, one gave the other a fatal blow, but it was the last thing he did, as he collapsed with total exhaustion.ldquoThey had killed each other ldquoYes, smiled Izzy, filling her cup with more tea and raising it. ldquoThatrsquos why the land around here is littered with all these huge stones.ldquoI know giants are mythological, aunty.Izzy sipped some tea.ldquoDepends what kind of giants you mean.Finn looked at the boulder.ldquoThe next tale is the gt of the sun, continued Izzy.ldquoAfter the death of the giants the land was bathed in sunshine, bringing new le.It became a green world, grass and plants grew, then trees arrived. The ancestors of this tree were first to arrive, she pointed to the nearby silver birch.ldquoOthers followed: the rowan, the aspen, alder and even oak. But it was these trees which made the forest canopy: Scots pines, also called Caledonian pines, an old name given to them by the Romans. Arenrsquot they a beautul tree Finn peered at the Scots pines around them.ldquoCreatures filled the forest with their songs, their roars, their grunting and howling the birds, bears, wolves, elk, deer and boar. Seven thousand years ago, where we sit we would have been amidst the Caledonian forest in its prime. Those trees over there are the descendants of that forest. If you sit with them and feel their presence, they will tell you their stories.Finn chuckled at his aunt, then explained why. ldquoYou are like Yoda! He defensively held up his hands to explain: ldquoNot the way you look, I mean the way you speak about things.Finn was a Star Wars fan. He had all three films on video at home and knew much of the dialogue by heart. He spoke to Izzy, mimicking Yodarsquos voice: ldquoSearch the force, le creates it, makes it grow, its energy surrounds us and binds us, luminous beings are we. Finn gently pinched Izzy on the shoulder, saying: ldquoNot this crude matter. You must feel the force around you, the tree, the rock, everywhere.Izzy laughed out loud, feeling rather flattered to be compared to one of Finnrsquos screen heroes. She thanked him for the compliment.Finn looked over at the old Scots pines on the other side of the river. He knew his aunt wanted to reach them and they were tantalisingly close, yet the river was too dangerous to cross.ldquoLetrsquos find a way to get there, he ventured.They packed up and followed the river, eventually finding a place to cross. They sat amidst the flowering heather under the canopy of old trees, near a clearing so a light breeze kept the midges at bay. As promised, Izzy spun legends of Merlin, but also other tales connected to the ancient forest: of Lailoken, the Picts and St Columba, and the sad tale of the last wolf. Finn added tales of his own, about Jedi Knights and what he could remember of the story of Tam Linn. The forest was both their theatre and audience. But there was a sense of melancholy in this wood, for something was missing: it was bereft of young trees. The old pines were missing their children.The walk back was much quicker and they arrived back at the car tired, but with a sense of achievement. It felt asthey had been in a dferent world.ldquoCan we camp tonight aunty  asked Finn. ldquoAnd have a campfire like the first night ldquoLetrsquos see how the weather holds and how we feel later, she replied, keeping options open.Food was now a priority and Izzy was keen to get away from the busyness of Tyndrum. Soon they were on their way, heading for Loch Tulla, where she planned to make their tea. She knew Ewen would already be at the Bridge of Orchy. What she didnrsquot know was his mum was with him, Finnrsquos grandmother, whom Finn had loved so much.She was waiting with her son in his car, literally trembling with emotion, desperate to see her beloved grandson, whom she hadnrsquot seen for more than four and a half years.Here are the links to chapters one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, , ,  and ."},{"url":null,"title":"section-a1-closed-overnight-later-month-work-overhead-lines","story":"Roadworks on the A, between the Thistly Cross and Abbotsview junctions, mean that the road will be closed from pm on May  until am the following day.A spokesman for Bear Scotland confirmed that work was being carried out by Keltbray on behalf of ScottishPower.He said that Keltbray had produced a statement, which reads: ldquoKeltbray, on behalf of ScottishPower, are carrying out essential work on a section of overhead lines between May  at pm to May  at am which will result in the closure of a section of the A.ldquoThis will include work on the high voltage and low voltage networks, changing electricity poles and overhead power cables.ldquoWe are replacing and refurbishing equipment which is coming to the end of its serviceable le, which is essential works to make sure we maintain a good quality of supply for our customers.ldquoA ersion route will be in place.ldquoAccess for emergency vehicles will be maintained at all times."},{"url":null,"title":"bbcs-money-nothing-salvages-items-kinwegar-recycling-centre-wallyford","story":"Salvage superhero Sarah Moore was at the East Lothian Council-run site at Kinwegar recently to pick up unwanted goods, give them a new lease of le and turn them into cash for their original owners.The presenter spoke to three East Lothian men ndash two from Musselburgh and one from Elphinstone ndash who arrived at the skips to dispose of the three items.They were delighted to hand them over to her and appear on the programme, which was aired on BBC last month.Michael Clague, the owner of the four-man tent, from Musselburgh, said it was ldquopast its use-by date.He said: ldquoIrsquom just glad the tent is going to be recycled as it was sitting in our garage for some time.Sarah took it to award-winning bag maker Neil Wragg, who turned the old tent into  tote bags, which were sold to people all over the country via social media.Sarah visited the Honest Toun to hand over pound to Michael, who said he would use the cash for a homecoming for his son, who was at sea, and donate some to the Tranent-based Walk with Scott Foundation to help with its charity work.Another Musselburgh man, Alan, was getting ready to throw away a glass-topped coffee table.

SunflowersLt spirits with this summer favourite loved by birds and bees. The flower heads come in a range of colours, from yellows to dark reds and oranges. You might want to pick a very tall iety such as American Giant, which can reach a towering height of around m.\"Sunflower seeds are large, making them easy for tiny hands to handle - they can be sown inidually in pots first and placed on a bright windowsill, or sown straight into the soil in a sunny spot. Sow them in May and keep them well watered,\" Cama advises. \"Watch out for slugs as the seedlings appear and support the stem with a cane as the plant gets taller. Sunflowers take about - weeks to grow from seed to flower.\"Add a sense of excitement and keep kids interested by having a sunflower growing competition, involving your household or street,\" suggests Cama. \"Or consider gting potted sunflower seedlings to friends and neighbours to brighten up their day.\". NasturtiumsNasturtiums not only look pretty, they have edible peppery-tasting flowers that are great for decorating summer salads. Carefully sprinkle the large seeds into cm-deep drills made in the soil and then cover up. Give trailing ieties a go by sowing them in a container or hanging basket.Children might enjoy keeping an eye out for caterpillars of the cabbage white butterfly, which often munch their way through the leaves. These hungry caterpillars are interesting to watch and provide food for birds so its worth putting up with a bit of damage, Cama suggests.. Dwarf French beansPods of dwarf French beans can be eaten fresh from the plant or are delicious cooked up as a side helping of vegetables. French bean pods come in a range of dferent colours from green to cream and yellow to purple. Varieties include Cobra, Tendergreen, Purple Teepee and Purple Queen.This type of bean doesnt like the frost, so the end of May to early July is the ideal time to sow them outdoors, planted cm deep and cm apart.\"They grow to about cm tall so are best grown grouped together so the plants support each other. Another option is to collect twigs and push them upright into the ground to help keep the beans climb up and keep them off the soil. Remember to keep the beans well-watered, especially during dry weather,\" Cama advises.. Squash\"Squash are exciting to growyou have lots of space and they come in a huge assortment of dferent shapes, sizes and colours. One even has flesh that resembles vegetable spaghetti. Varieties include Sweet Dumpling, Crown Prince, Honey Bear, Sunburst and many more. You could even try growing a butternut squash,\" she suggests.Squash have very large seeds so are easy for little hands and fingers to plant. Sow in late May to early June and only plant them outside once all chances of frost have passed.Squash are very thirsty so keep them well watered, especially in the drier summer months. It is also a good idea to give each plant food in the form of liquid fertiliser , to help them grow luscious green leaves and lots of tasty inidual squashes.. HerbsBasil, coriander and chives can be grown in pots on an indoor windowsill, so are idealyou dont have much space. Sow these small seeds in pots and watch as they grow.\"Our top tip is to use a seed sower or the palm of your hand to sow these teeny tiny herb seeds.

But there doesnrsquot appear to have been any rebuke for the drugs deaths crisis, their failed education record, missed hospital waiting time targets, rising child poverty rates, the exam results scandal, or failures in local policing.The next Scottish Government has an opportunity over the next five years to make amends for past failures and getting caught up in an independence campaign will only take the SNPrsquos eye off the ball once again.However, the SNP did not win a majority in the election and as a minority government will require support from other parties to pass budgets and any major reforms.The Scottish Greens will likely prop up the SNP in future policy discussions, but this will requirepolicy trade-offs infor budget support.With COP firmly in the sights of both parties as an opportunity to showcase Scotland as a leader in tackling climate change on the global stage, will the Scottish Greens be willing to lend support to independence which could risk the SNP taking its focus off meeting its emissions reduction targets of % by  ndash which it has done for the past two years in a row.They have already said they want bold action from the Scottish Government and now they are in a position to bargain for this.Read more:Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureDuring Sundayrsquos Andrew Marr programme, a suggestion of next spring to hold another referendum was put to the First Minister, to which, of course, she said she was contemplating. Nicola Sturgeon hasnrsquot officially committed to a timescale, other than the first half of the next parliamentary term, but it would appear that the media is setting the ball rolling by proposing such a timeline. As much as I have criticised the SNP for pedalling talks of Indyref during a pandemic, journalists are also guilty of fuelling the debate and diminishing print space or airtime for more immediate and pressing issues.Over the past week I have been moving into my new house, which has involved many hours of deep cleaning whilst tuned in to my radio and coverage of the election.Hats off to BBC Radio Scotland team for managing to fill three daysrsquo worth of election coverage with very little to report on other than the one major news story: would the SNP gain a majority Although they covered results and reaction across the entire country, the main topic on every reportersrsquo lips was whether the SNP would have a mandate to hold another referendum. So, for every listener tuned in, we are being told that this is the discussion we need to be having, this is the headline we should all be taking away.In between googling tutorials on how to sand kitchen worktops, I checked in to the community Facebook page for my local village and was struck by the fact that none of the members were remotely engaged in discussions over the election, let alone independence. Like many other communities across the country, this village is still in the grips of a pandemic, so quite understandably, most posts and discussions revolved around Covid advice and best practice, information about the local youth club reopening, as well as a series of church services.Read more:Scottish election: Indyref cant continue to dominate the next five years mdash there are bigger issuesMembers were posting aboutfitness camps and slots which had come available for hairdressers and beauty salons.

It could be your living room or home office, or simply a bright corner of your kitchen or a balconyyou live in a flat. Just wherever you feel good and where you can relax like you would on holiday, surrounded by plants.Are there rules for where you place your plants Plants love light and require it for photosynthesis. However, the amount of light they need to thrive is particular to each plant. For example, cacti and succulents generally love the bright sun on the windowsill.Which plants are likely to give you least trouble Calathea zebrina, aloe, sansevieria, spider plants, pothos and peace lily.How do you match your plants to your decor Find your plants some beautul pots and baskets. Perhaps you could go for a handwoven basket that matches the colour palette and style of your interior. This may be custom-designed, a classic terracotta pot, a vintage planter, or you can even make your own ceramic pots at a workshop.Which houseplants are trickier to grow Usually, plants that grow in very dferent native conditions such as high humidity can pose some challenges when growing them indoors. This includes alocasia, the banana palm and some philodendrons. Others such as the date palm require specic temperatures and lots of space to grow, which can also present challenges indoors.Which houseplants prefer shadier conditions For shadier conditions we recommend the ZZ plant , epipremnum, the Philodendron Brasil, as well as colocasia and azalea.Which houseplants can be moved to a sunny patio or balcony and can be left out in summer As long as temperatures dont drop too muchduring the warmer months, plants like the banana palm, kentia palm, agaves, opuntia, kalanchoe, crassula, haworthia and chamaerops palm can be kept outside at night.Some, like the palms and certain succulents, can even be kept outdoors all year long, but need to be protected from frost. Also ensure the soil and pot are well drained to prevent root rot due to heavy rainfall.How can the plants be cared for when the weather cools Before bringing your plants inside, check them for pests that they picked up outside. Make sure you find them a spot in your home where they get a similar amount of daylight as on your balcony or patio.Expect some leaf drop from the adjustment to new light conditions, which is normal, and help your plant by removing the dead leaves.Avoid any extreme changes in temperature and dont put your plants near or on top of the radiator, or next to a front door that opens frequently, as sudden hot and cold draughts can cause the plants stress.When you bring your plants inside, or when you start heating your home again during the colder months, adjust your watering schedule. Most plants require less water during hibernation, butyour apartment is very dry, use a humidier to keep your plants happy.Also, foliage growth slows down considerably during autumn and winter so you can stop fertilising until spring.Which houseplants will match your chosen destination Moroccan riad: Banana palm, papyrus plant, colocasia, Phoenix canariensis , bougainvillea, oleander, agave.Mediterranean haven: Lavender, Opuntia cacti, eucalyptus, olive tree, any kind of citrus tree, Chamaerops palm.Australian rainforest: Kentia palm, Schefflera actinophyla, umbrella tree, Epipremnum pinnatum, Alocasia brisbanensis, Hoya australis, Staghorn fern.South African safari: Strelitzia nicolai, kalanchoe, Zamioculcas zamiolia, string of pearls, crassula, Euphorbia ingens, haworthia, protea.Japanese garden: Azalea, Japanese spindle, moss balls , bonsai trees, a mini zen garden, Japanese painted fern.Amazonian jungle: Philodendrons of all sorts including monsteras, Thaumatophyllum xanadu, Calathea Burle Marxii, Calathea ornata, Begonia maculata, orchids, airplants, heliconia, dieffenbachia."},{"url":null,"title":"recipe-french-bean-toasted-hazelnut-salad","story":"Ingredientsg French or runner beans- tablespoons extra virginolive oil cloves garlic, peeled and sliced dried chilli crushed tablespoon red wine vinegarBlack pepperHandful finely chopped flat leaf parsley handfuls hazelnuts or pine nuts, roasted for - minutes in a medium oven.MethodTop and tail the beans.

A couple of hours later Irsquod be woken by a sozzled opera singer, wending his way home along Ingram Street and treating us to arias from Verdi and Puccini.Irsquod never lived anywhere like it, and even though I am now happily ensconced in the country, I miss the buzz and beauty of Glasgowrsquos majestic city centre. Yet there are some things I donrsquot pine for. Not long after I arrived, an independent grocer set up business, offering all the fruit, veg and granary loaves yoursquod ever need. Sadly, he didnrsquot last long, driven out by the proleration of micro-supermarkets. Soon it became harder to find a bag of red lentils than a magnum of champagne or a state of the art sound system.Children were as rare as ospreys. Yoursquod hear the purring of a Lexus as it idled at the lights, and at weekends the squealing of revellers tottering from club to club. But hardly ever did I see, let alone hear, a youngster. On our floor there were more French pugs than prams.The centre of Glasgow, with its high-end shops, restaurants, bars, and penthouse flats, prided itself on its glamour. Yet by the time we left, swathes of it had been turned into soulless student-land. This ever-shting community mirrored the wider picture: people living in self-contained pods, barely connecting with anyone .I never knew the names of our next door neighbours I couldnrsquot even have picked them out in an identity parade. As became increasingly apparent, you might have every extravagance money can buy within a five-minute walk, but painfully absent was a sense of community.The pandemic has highlighted a long-brewing problem. When shop and cafeacute shutters come down, students flee and the elderly retreat indoors, the centre becomes ghostly: a neighbourhood without a pulse.This unhealthy trend has not gone unnoticed. In recognition of the people-shaped hole at its heart, Glasgow City Council has devised a long-term plan to revivy the centre. Its Strategic Development Frameworksets out enlightened proposals aimed at regenerating six areas of the city, including what you might call the dead centre.For this zone, as with others, the aim is to transform it into a pedestrian-friendly and family oriented destination for day trips. At the same time the council wants to repopulate it, thereby making the area more appealing to residents who want to live there fully, rather than treat their flat as a bunkhouse. Along with initiatives to promote walking and cycling, and to reconnect the centre with surrounding districts, the hope is that by  its population will have doubled.No-one will miss the irony of trying to attract families back to an area that was once renowned for some of the highest-density housing in Europe. The demolition of overcrowded slums in the post-war era was seen as tackling disease and deprivation. Instead, the solution ndash tower blocks and housing schemes pushed to the outskirts ndash created arguably even worse problems. Meanwhile, the centre languished.It was this sort of short-sighted urban planning, which messed with peoplersquos lives, that the writer Jane Jacobs tore into. Her classic book, The Death and Le of Great American Cities ndash published in  but as fresh as todayrsquos newspaper ndash was a salvo against dehumanising architecture and development. When it came out, it was immediately understood, she said, by what she calls ldquofoot people: residents who either prefer to get around on foot, or wish they could ditch the car.Jacobs started out as a newspaper reporter, although she married an architect who, she wrote, taught her what she needed to become an architectural writer. That her views became so influential, despite her having no authority other than a clear mind and good taste, points to the obvious truth. Ordinary people instinctively know what makes a city tick: what works and what is doomed from the start.You donrsquot need a degree in urban planning to see that concrete wastelands, featureless parks or pigeon-hole flats in the sky are a recipe for misery. Or that well-designed green spaces allowing people to breathe completely change the mood and potential of a district. What Scotland needs right now is our own Jane Jacobs, to articulate the city dwellerrsquos view.The novelist John Cheever understood how hard it could be to pinpoint the problem. In The Wapshot Chronicle he describes a fictional scene: ldquoNorth of the park you come into a neighbourhood that seems blighted ndash not persecuted but only unpopular, asit suffered acne or bad breath, and it has a bad complexion ndash colorless and seamed and missing a feature here and there.Most of us who know Glasgow ndash indeed almost any city in the world ndash could point to places this perfectly fits. Now, it seems Glasgowrsquos leaders are intent on fixing the problems previous generations of developers helped create. I wish them well. But, unfortunately, there are factors to be considered which are beyond the control of any planner.Quite how to address this is for others to consider, butGlasgow city centrersquos transformation is to succeed then solutions to such wildcat problems must be factored into its vision. It sounds daunting, but it is not necessarily an impossible task.Jane Jacobs believed that, ldquoLively, erse, intense cities contain the seeds of their own regeneration, with energy enough to carry over for problems and needs outside themselves.Irsquom no expert, but that sounds like Glasgow to me.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions. They do not necessarily represent the views of the Herald."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-government-allowed-human-nature-let-fans-ibrox","story":"In the circumstances it is not surprising that their dedicated fans wanted to celebrate boisterously.However, like many, I was totally appalled at the scenes of Rangers fans all crowding together and behaving so badly. Well, I was appalled until I read that Rangers FC, understanding their fans very well, had tried to pre-empt trouble and ensure a celebration that would be both safe and satisfy their fans enthusiasm.They knew that it would not be possible to stop fans from inidually and separately deciding to go to Ibrox to celebrate this remarkable victory, so how much better to manage the process.In April, the chairman of the club wrote to the Scottish Government suggesting that, on four successive nights, , season ticket holders could be invited to Ibrox to join an in-stadium celebration.The request was turned down on the grounds that it did not comply with Covid rules. In my book this makes the Scottish Government culpable for the scenes in Glasgow, yet I see that the same Scottish Government is now heaping all the blame on to the football club and trying to work out how to punish it.Itrsquos no good Nicola Sturgeon emoting about how she feels our painshe does not understand human nature. The Rangers fans were always going to gather to celebrate in the same way that those grieving over Sarah Everadersquos disappearance were always going to gather in a vigil. How much better in both instancethe governments concerned had recognised the force of human emotion and allowed both events to take place safely, as proposed. Therersquos no virtue in being all bossy and sticking to the rulesit leads to a situation that canrsquot then be controlled. In any case, the Covid rules are not absolutes ndash they y too much between the four nations for that to be true.Judith Gillespie, Edinburgh.DONT BLAME SNP FOR VIOLENCESURELY only someone as blinkered as Brian Wilsonwould attempt to blame the SNP for the violent attacks on the police by unionist mobs in George Square. It is noticeable that the carnage has not been condemned by Tory politicians or by Scotland in Union officials.Mr Wilson also ignores the clear scientic advice that shows poor ventilation in crowded indoor situations combined with the effects of alcohol makes the spreading of Covid much more likely.There is no reason for Scotland to follow Boris Johnsonrsquos disastrous handling of Covid as illustrated by his failure to put India on the red list which allowed thousands to travel to the UK and bring the more virulent Indian iant to Glasgow, thus making it much more dficult to reopen hospitality venues and football stadiums.If Glasgow has to suffer further or extended restrictions thanks to the selfish actions of those Rangers supporters in George Square, then itrsquos guaranteed Mr Wilson will blame the SNP.Mary Thomas, Edinburgh.CELEBRATIONS WITHOUT THE BILETHE headline over Brian Wilsons article states that the \"SNP ... guaranteed George Square chaos\". Younger readers may not be aware of Mr Wilsons long history of visceral opposition to Scottish independence. Does he believe that the poisonous tribalism which afflicts our society in the West of Scotland and beyond and which sustains the dominance of the \"Old Firm\" over Scottish football is attributable in whole or in part to the SNP It may have escaped the notice of Mr Wilson and many others that the championships of SPFL League  and League  in  were also won by Glasgow teams. The smaller and more local tribes which support Partick Thistle and Queens Park were equally joyful and held celebrations which attracted little or no media attention.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.WAS THERE UNITY IN A COMMON CAUSE NEIL Mackay claims that \"sectarianism shows a Scottish face to the world\" .As is understood, the tribal Rangers Celtic Protestant Catholic ide arose from immigration in previous centuries.It is to be hoped that sectarianism in the west of Scotland gathers less publicity when the world looks at Pollokshields and the strong public intervention to stop brutal dawn raids on two immigrants who were from a country far away.It would be interesting to knowthat gathering included many Rangers and Celtic supporters united in that effort to prevent the immigrantsrsquo deportation. Or in the same George Square on Sunday after the Rangers mayhem in the previous hours, who knowsthose united at the peaceful rally for Palestinians from another country far away from Scotland included Rangers and Celtic supporters protesting in that common cause Maybe any future humanitarian-type protestations could show a representation of peaceful Rangers and Celtic supporters in their colours to show the world that the destructive face of sectarianism is promoted only by a flawed section of small-minded people who are outnumbered by the big-hearted people of Scotland. This may help discard bigotry and prejudice as all come together to promote a better face to the world of concern and kindness to the desperate and the downtrodden.Irene Munro, Conon Bridge.CAUSE FOR DISMAY AND CONCERNWE would need to have a heart of stone not to have been moved by the words of Canon Matt McManus . Here we have a man who has clearly spent his le in works for the public good feeling that he has to write such words in disbelief, bewilderment and, perhaps, even despair at the hatred generated toward him in certain quarters.While his sense of dismay will have moved our hearts, it should also be recording concern in our minds. Yes, concern in our minds because we live in a country where such awful behaviour can still arise. No doubt the many true friends of Canon McManus, to whom he refers, will be confirming to him that his many years of work and service are truly valued and appreciated.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.CHALLENGE UNJUST LAWS IN COURTIF \"the law of the land should not be sovereign over the will of the people\" as suggested by David Gray , then who rules  The answer is simply anarchy.If any law is perceived to be so onerous or unjust the answer is clear: it can be challenged in court and changed by Parliament.This Mr Gray acknowledges in the case of suffragettes .There were many residents in Pollokshields who were not best pleased by the antics of those who chanted and shouted their opposition to the legal removal of two illegal immigrants, especially on the grounds that the timings were religiously inauspicious, that is, the end of Ramadan and the beginning of the Festival of Eid. It transpired that they were not of the Islamic faith, rather Sikhism. Im not convinced that the deeds of the Pollokshields protestors could be labelled \"kindly motivated actions\" by lying under a vehicle and blocking the police.Robin Johnston, Newton Mearns.SWINNEY OFF TO A BAD STARTAS always the news on your front page this morning makes interesting reading. John Swinney has been moved from his outstanding successin education, to deal with the current Covid situation, which as we know is causing much worry and distress .Having overseen the continuous fall in education standards in Scotland since he became Education Secretary in , what have we to look forward to in the coming days and months with regards to Mr Swinneys dabbling with Covid  He hasnt started well, of course, stating that the \"silence from Rangers was deafening as fans gathered last Saturday\" ndash as was his, the First Ministers and Humza Yousafs deafening silence about the congregation of hundreds of protesters in Pollokshields last Thursday, the thousands demonstrating in George Square during the Palestinian Support Rally last Sunday and the thousands demonstrating outside the BBC headquarters in Glasgow on the same day. Selective Covid restrictions being enforced would appear to be the name of the game under the new SNP regime.I presume, too, that Mr Swinney will replace the First Minister at her daily and or regular TV news updates re Covid  That must be a dficult decision for the humble Ms Sturgeon to make ndash what on earth will she be concentrating her efforts on  Let me guess.Walter Paul, Glasgow.Read more: I have sought to do good for  years.

As these lsquoheat highwaysrsquo pass through urban areas, some of the heat can be extracted by submerged pipes and boosted in temperature by large scale heat pumps.

However, it is also important that I exercise that mandate with responsibility and humility, and only when the crisis of Covid has passed. I give that commitment today.Whether that load of self-confessed humility emerges remains to be seen.However the pace of exercising her mandate is not, for now, in doubt.With the pandemic still proving immune to wishful thinking by politicians, the economy stumbling, and the polls showing it would be a terric gamble right now, the First Minister is not about to ramp up the Yes campaign any time soon.There are also the small matters of a refusenik Prime Minister, Westminster sovereignty, and a potential fight at the UK Supreme Court to consider.In addition, Ms Sturgeon knows she will be pounced on by the opposition and certain sections of the pressshe starts to turn her attention away from the recovery onto the constitution.Throughout the election campaign, her rivals repeatedly said it would be unconscionable for civil service resources to be applied to the case for leaving the UK amid the crisis.By promising to make Covid and the economy her top priority, Ms Sturgeon tacitly went along with this argument.Her allergic reaction to questions about basic issues such as borders and trade, deficit reduction, currency and a central bank, suggests she did so in large part because she doesnrsquot have a strong enough pitch to make yet.The argument from democracy remains the strongest one for independence because it is the most enduring. It applies in all weathers.The idea that the people who live and work in a nation should decide and supply its system of government is straightforward and appealing.However the argument from economics, a cornerstone of Alex Salmondrsquos offer in , is as weak as it has ever been under the SNP.Not only has Brexit scrambled previous assumptions about cross-border trade between Scotland and the rest of the UK, the pandemic has shot the public finances to hell.So for now Ms Sturgeon is holding back, pinned down by her opponents, and leaving her new Constitution Secretary Angus Robertson to focus on rhetoric and process and buttering up the chancelleries of Europe.But that does not mean all is quiet on the constitutional front. Far from it.Since the election, there has been a marked surge in activity by Unionist organisations keen to keep Ms Sturgeon gagged and to fill the vacuum with their own arguments.There have been polls and open letters, commissions and demands for parliamentary inquiries.The key players are Gordon Brownrsquos Our Scottish Future, the anti-Indyref Scotland in Union group, blogger Kevin Haguersquos These Islands, and Scottish Business UK .Being Unionists, they naturally work in concert.

In ,  stops were recorded and over , passengers came ashore.The council’s head of marine services, transportation and harbour master, Jim Buck, has moved to reassure the wider Orkney public of the stringent measures being discussed, in order to facilitate the lucrative industry.Dialogue continues between OIC and cruise companies, tourist groups and business networks, and confirmation has still not been received from the Scottish Government on when and how the resumption of cruising in and around Orkney waters will begin, and in what shape.Mr Buck said: “The tourism industry — and this includes cruise — is a vital part of Orkney’s economy, and to not allow it towould adversely affect many people and businesses. I want to encourage an industry that was very important for us beforehand to recover.“This does not mean to say that we will rush into anything, and every step will be in line with and directed by national government and industry guidance and best practice.“It has been over a year now since the last cruise ship called into Orkney, and it is very likely that this will not happen for some time yet. It is impossible for us to put a date on this at present, as we simply do not know the answer — this will be dictated by UK and Scottish Governments — it is for them to decide, and we will be guided by the ongoing advice provided by the Government and Public Health Scotland as restrictions are eased.”Mr Buck stressed that ato pre-pandemic cruise activity in Orkney is not on the cards.Nevertheless, conversations surrounding the management of cruise passengers continue to take place, discussions that are hampered somewhat by uncertainty over the guidance in which the industry will operate.Planning ahead is the sensible option, according to Mr Buck, to start these “green shoots of recovery to make sure that everyone benefits from money being spent here.”“The cruise industry is very aware of reputational damage by not getting this right that is why they are so keen to ensure all the i’s are dotted and the t’s crossed from the outset,” continued Mr Buck.“We are working hard to develop the safety protocols and risk assessments we all believe will be necessary to try and ensure cruise can restart as safely as possible and with stringent safety measures in place.“The discussions we have had with the cruise industry are focused very much on a safe and secure , both for their customers but for Orkney as well. It is in no one’s interests for it to be anything other.“The safety measures will depend on what the regulations are, and the big problem at the moment is that we simply do not have final guidance at this stage of what we are working towards.“The conversations we have had are everything from everyone on board being COVID-vaccinated and proving that, to extremely reduced numbers of passengers on board. We have also discussed passengers not coming ashore or,they do, only allowing bubble tours or a drive around the many tourist sites.”One key aspect of discussions is the increasing success of the vaccination programme, and that cruise tourism is “impeccably planned and managed”.“We will at least have a lot of information and certainty on vaccination status, and ability to plan for passenger arrivals and movements when they do arrive. In any event, we are planning for every opportunity.”He reiterated that the industry has been operating on a “rolling cancellation” programme and that all bookings, at any time, are regarded as provisional until a vessel confirms it is en-route and anchors or docks in Orkney.Mr Buck added: “We remain in the position that we are not allowed to open up for cruise liners and we will not release any spaces until the Scottish Government says we can.“Orkney is my home and I understand people’s concerns — we are all living through the pandemic. But it is vital for this industry to resume — we just need to make sure it is done as safely as we can.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Only  per cent were in favour, with  per cent choosing #other.#Despite this clear decision, Lockstep is exactly what folk got, leaving many businesses closed for another month.This is a developing story, and The Orcadian will be speaking to islands leaders throughout the week.Since submitting the FOI, the Scottish Government have now published the results of the consultation on their website.Full story will be available in the upcoming edition of The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We did a huge amount of work including introducing a one-way system, social distancing measures and putting down markers,” said theatre manager Paul Baines. “One of the biggest challenges was getting people in and out safely.“We have to ensure the measures are genuine and effective and they are visible. Visible reassurance is important for customer confidence.“It is a juggling act because you have to balance creating a too clinical atmosphere with offering a unique theatre experience.”The theatre has been awarded the VisitEngland We’re Good to Go industry standard mark, signying that it adheres to government and public health COVID- guidance, also approved by UK Theatre Seat Safety.Alongside familiar COVID- safety measures, Rosie Fraser has introduced a new service called “Silent Treatment”.“We love a good chat but we also understand some people prefer not to,” said Rosie, whose beauty salon opened in .“Clients can see the service as soon as they look at the online booking menu and add it with whatever treatments they are having.“We still carry out a full consultation and then let them just relax.”Also in place are bespoke engraved screens between stations, extra time for cleaning, screening forms for track and trace, PPE and sanitising measures. Rosie emphasises that it is safety with style! Members of the seven-strong team are carrying out rapid COVID- tests at home thanks to the UK Government asymptomatic testing initiative.“We have exciting plans for this year in expanding. COVID- and lockdown has reaffirmed how much people need care and pampering to feel good.”Investment has helped Fish City in Belfast continue operating. The award-winning seafood restaurant extended its seating, installed outdoor heating and started a delivery service. Since reopening for outdoor dining, it has been doing a brisk trade bolstered by confidence in the vaccine programme. Reopening indoors is scheduled to start on May .“We created a dining room upstairs with a completely dferent feel,” said John, who owns the restaurant with his we Grainne. Safety processes include a digital thermometer mounted at the door which all staff and customers are required to pass before entering. Anyone recording a high temperature is refused admission.Hand sanitisers are also available. Kitchen and front of house staff are required to wear masks and wash their hands regularly. Tables and chairs are cleaned rigorously after every diner. The restaurant’s commitment to the safety is also seen in its recognition as COVID- Compliant by Tourism NI.“If I could do cartwheels, I would” is one retail chief’s response to welcoming the public back.“When we saw the first trickle of people coming back last month, it was lovely,” enthused village location manager Meurig Jones. “Portmeirion needs people here.“It’s lovely but it isn’t what it should be without people appreciating it. It’s easier this year in that it was such a new thing when we opened in July.“We had to do a lot of work to train the staff into a new way of working. We’re constantly improving and we’re learning as we go on.”App orders and one-way systems will ensure ongoing safety. Outside seating, pods and marquee are also available. Misting machines, meanwhile, will keep hotels “squeaky clean – safe for staff and guests”.Meurig added: “There’s hand sanitiser outside every shop and we ask people to wear masks indoors, but not outside.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Subsequent site investigation works were undertaken, and confirmed the presence of oil contamination below part of the area, which falls within the council’s ownership.However, after writing to the MoD, it was in November  that confirmation came that OIC was unsuccessful in its request that the MoD foots the bill for the clean-up operation.According to the MoD, the evidence did not support them assuming liability for the contamination.The ambition to attract new businesses and industries to Lyness, transforming and breathing new le into the area with signicant new job creation, has been held by OIC for years.Its potential and the characteristics the area boasts have been lauded by the authority for some time, but aside from interested glances and preliminary works carried out by companies, nothing has come to fruition.The last of these was in , when plans to revitalise the area into a decommissioning base to serve the oil and gas industry failed to materialise.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The BBC should have made greater effort to get to the bottom of what happened at the time and been more transparent about what it knew.ldquoWhile the BBC cannot turn back the clock after a quarter of a century, we can make a full and unconditional apology.

Before there was a space available for her I was away in college and my mother had to care for my grandmother as dementia caused her to become increasingly dficult to look after.“My mother had very little free time as she had to look after my younger siblings, manage the croft, work five days a week and care for my grandmother. Replacing the old folks’ home with ‘social care flats’ would not be adequate for looking after my grandmother.”Mr MacLeod’s ‘Halt the Hub’ petition on the  degrees website is addressed to the comhairle, Scottish Government, SNP election candidate Alasdair Allan and Western Isles MP Angus MacNeil.It states: “If the comhairle is going to spend £ million on a development on Barra they shouldn’t dismiss opinions expressed by the people living on Barra. The consultation with the local community where most expressed a wish to have separate buildings for dferent local services appears to have been ignored by the decision makers in the comhairle and the Scottish Government.”One petitioner, known as Jeanne C, stated on the  degrees website: “Nothing about this ugly hub is right and there has been insufficient representation from Barra. All facilities will be smaller – with Covid distancing  We will have no care home and Eoligarry [Primary] School will be closed.“The comhairle is spending millions on decanting pupils instead of building the new school just near the old one. The comhairle and the health board can do exactly what they like with our island in the face of our expressed concerns. Lewis, by the way, is to have a new care home.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/UIG-TIDY-UP-3-scaled.jpg","title":"uig beach clean volunteers remove two years worth of","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineCommunity members came out in force across the course of the day with their efforts culminating in a skip-load of rubbish being cleared from Uig beach.Young and old beach buddies worked hard to remove two years’ worth of waste which had accumulated since the last event in .shortly after the beach clean, Ross Watson, the north Scotland site manager for Woodland Trust Scotland said: “It was gloriously warm and we must have had around  people take part in the clean over the course of today.“It was also a great occasion for people to catch up, so there was probably as much chatting as there was litter picking.“We filled the whole skip and had to work really hard to fit everything in. There was a huge amount of rope and all sorts of litter.“Beyond that there was general litter such as Coke bottles, beer cans, and a few face masks. The only odd thing we found was a massive oxygen tank.”Highlighting the volume of rubbish encountered during the clean, he added: “Nearly everyone who came along was from the community and they had seen this litter building up over the last two years.“The beach clean is an annual event we tend to do in April but we had to cancel last year’s so this year is basically two years’ worth including two winter storms’ worth.”When asked how much of the responsibility for the mess he believed lay with local people, he went on to say: “Some of the litter will certainly be from local industry but so much of it will be dropped from people on the island – whether locally or swept in.“The problem is not just local to here, it’s a UK-wide issue.”Addressing the challenges facing the village more broadly, Mr Watson said: “On Friday one of our contractors pulled up two trailers of fly-tipped metal down the side of one of the bridges away from the beach.“That has been years’ worth of local people dumping bikes, climbing frames and all sorts of bits and pieces. Both the Woodland Trust and the Uig Community Trust were speaking today about how we can make a bigger impact through this event, and how we can cover the whole of the community.“There is real potential for the event to be an Uig clean as a whole and not just a beach clean.“A lot of people were saying that it was the first event that they had been to in well over a year, while some of the older people hadn’t seen anyone for months.“It was a real feel-good event from that side of things.“There was a mixture of working-age parents through to retired folks.“It was great to see the kids there and have a chat with their parents. The children were appalled at the amount of litter on the beach, and we were talking about what they can do to help. Getting the message across to them about these matters at an early stage is ideal.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portree-View-scaled.jpg","title":"new skye homes to be sold at a fixed","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine revealed proposals by London-based developer Charlie Garton Jones to build  family homes in Portree on the site of the old golf course off the Struan Road.The plans,approved, will comprise  three-bedroom houses, and five four-bedroom houses, each with a garden and drive, situated on a site of around five acres in total.Mr Garton Jones lodged a planning application with Highland Council in late April this year, and hopes to provide homeowners with an ultrafast one gigabyte broadband connection free of charge for the first five years via the excess capacity the Bracken Hide Hotel will have from the nearby BT exchange.If given the green light, the scheme will be built on land next to where the developer is constructing his -cabin hotel, which is scheduled to open in April .Mr Garton Jones runs an independent estate agency specialising in the sale and rental of residential property in London, which has offices in Westminster, Nine Elms, Cha and Battersea.He also owns the Cow Shed boutique bunkhouse in Uig. report on Mr Garton Jones’ proposals has sparked a heated debate via the paper’s Facebook page over the last few days, attracting more than  comments.Although opinions dfered on the appearance of the houses, the main point of contention centred on whether the homes would be affordable and accessible to local people.Peter Brown commented: “The local community should have the final say. Personally I would think social housing should be a priority.”While Helen Grianan said: “Will these houses be £, or under  If not, they are not affordable housing for locals or key workers.”Calum J Morrison from North Uist was in favour of the scheme saying: “Sounds like a good type of thing in my opinion, the dude seems to know what he’s doing, good luck to him I say!”Annie B Campbell, meanwhile, highlighted broader issues with housing on the island, stating: “Key workers, like some NHS and teachers, are being outbid for most of the houses that come on the market in Skye.“They are not ‘officially’ homeless so do not have enough points to qualy for council housing.“Some are forced to skip between illegal short term lets. This is not simply a locals versus incomers issue.“Key workers coming to fill essential jobs on the island and local families need somewhere to live. There is a very real housing crisis.”Mr Garton Jones said the price of the houses could not be confirmed until planning permission was obtained.However, in the last few days, he took to social media to try to address worries that people on the island will be priced-out of buying the properties.“There has been a lot of focus on the larger family house we are hoping to build but  of the  houses we are building are smaller, three bedroom, houses,” he commented.Kevin McMahon simply asked: “Will there be a first refusal for locals and the children of local families ”In response, Mr Garton Jones said: “I am happy to confirm that the properties will not be sold via the Scottish ‘sealed bids offers over’ system but will be sold at a fixed price on a first-come, first-served basis.“Obviously until we have planning, we cannot sell the houses, but we have opened up a ‘waiting list’., which is the only place the houses have so far been mentioned or advertised – have emailed me to express their interest in the houses.“Many of them do, indeed, appear to be locals, although we will not be checking birth certicates as part of the sales process.”He added: “There are  houses in total, soyou would like your name added to the list, please email me via charlie@gartonjonesChisolm talked about his own chances of finding a home, questioned the effectiveness of the Highland Council in its current form, and underlined the importance of investing in smaller communities on the island.“I am living with my parents, and with my work I am fortunate to still live on Skye,” he said.“Saying that, I haven’t taken any steps to purchase a home as the prices do not justy the property, or are just too expensive.“I know people who have taken steps to purchase but were outbid either at the start or last minute.”Chisolm has worked for CalMac since  and says he has thought about moving to the Western Isles due to his poor prospects of finding a home on Skye.He said: “I have strong family connections to Lewis and Harris, and I might have the possibility of moving across as house prices haven’t been affected as much as on Skye in terms of second homes and holiday homes. However, it is now on the rise as on other neighbouring islands.”Chisolm believes a revamp of the local authority is needed to force meaningful change.“Skye is facing issues linked to the lack of investment and communications. That makes me question why are we governed by people in Inverness and not the people of Skye and the surrounding islands.“I look at the Western Isles, and I’m seeing housing developments across the islands in dferent areas with the goal of helping local people stay where they are from, sustaining school numbers — including Gaelic communities — and helping small areas grow.“That should be critical here and not just developing in Portree. Roads, housing, harbour investments are just a few aspects that link together and time is critical.”He added: “It’s very important for young people and young families to stay on the island with the support of affordable housing, whether that’s purchasing or renting.”Chisolm said he had been encouraged by responses to Iomairt an Eilein’s call to action.“Political responses ahead of the election have been very welcoming and we are grateful for the support,” he added. reported on plans to build a new -home private scheme on the outskirts of Portree.Commenting on the merits of the proposal, Chisolm said: “I welcome the new development in Portree, I’m sure many young people and families from Skye will benefit from thesethey are available at an affordable price.“That being said, I do question why we’re only developing in Portree. I can name many schools in surrounding communities that would benefit from even a half of a development like this.”Painting a stark picture of the dficulties facing townships such as Staffin, he said: “Smaller communities are missing out and our school numbers and Gaelic communities are suffering. This should be a wake-up call to our government and ‘our’ council that more housing investments in rural areas will have more of an impact and better outcomes.“We all have a right to articulate our viewpoints and opinions. Not everyone will agree but that’s what makes a community – having dferent voices for the benefit of our island.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3812692.jpg--.jpg?1621502247000\n","title":"moderator on visit to ballykeel","story":"Presbyterian Moderator Rev Dr David Bruce visited Ballykeel Presbyterian last Sunday.

The latest initiative is the brand new PCI Youth App.Rev David Thompson, Secretary to the Council for Congregational Le and Witness, explained that one of key elements of fruitful youth ministry is effective communication, which was challenging before Covid-, but has become even more so in present circumstances. The new app will allow congregations to safely and effectively keep in touch with young people, leaders and parents.”With a number of default ‘pages’, which can then be customised by congregations as their own ‘affiliate’ app, it brings everything together in one place, that is easily accessible to everyone involved in a church’s youth ministry. Congregations with less time and resources can start off with a basic template and build as their needs change, but others may want to be a little more adventurous, which makes it not just a useful tool for these times of additional challenge, but one that will continue to be useful long into the future.David Thompson explained that this makes the App very flexible, “As a Council, we were delighted to receive funding from Northern Ireland’s Education Authority to make the App freely available to  congregations and we have really been encouraged by its steady uptake by congregations. We hope that it will prove invaluable in effectively communicating not only what is happening, when and where, especially when our youth groups can’t meet in person.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3813137.jpg--.jpg?1621509111000\n","title":"moy park offer jab at work to employees","story":"Moy Park is facilitating its Northern Ireland workforce with the opportunity to receive the COVID- vaccination at work.

Mid and East Antrim has the lowest annual figure at , tonnes.These areas shipped .% and % of their waste outside Northern Ireland respectively.SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said: The SDLP is strongly committed to the circular economy: treating our waste as much as possible as a resource for further reuse, rather than as material to be dumped or burnt.It is particularly worrying that so much of Northern Ireland#s waste is being sent to other places for disposal.Councils have to up their game, processing wastes in ways that maximise their reuse.We must all accept our responsibility in reducing, reusing and recycling. These statistics are not just embarrassing, they are disgraceful.My local council, Derry City and Strabane, has shown what can be done with its #New  You# service.This takes old items such as furniture and redundant computers, restoring them for new use.Much more could be done along these same lines and I urge consumers to think before they dump.Alliance’s John Blair, a member of Stormont#s DAERA committee, added: Whilst there is evidence we have achieved recycling targets, we are not maximising recycling and circular economy opportunities.He said his party#s Green New Deal plan highlights the urgent need for a review of the current waste management structures in Northern Ireland, including an audit of existing residual waste capacity for landfill and incineration.Exportation of waste is not without risks or controversy.Last December several tonnes of household waste from here ended up in the sea off the east coast of the US while on its way to an incinerator in Orrington, Maine.It had been part of a larger shipment sent by Co Down-based company Re-Gen, which has contracts with councils to collect and dispose of black bin waste.Two cubes of shredded waste fell off a ship when they were being unloaded at docks during a storm, one of which could not be recovered.A clean-up operation ensued for what was deemed a one-off, extremely unfortunate occurrence.Last month the Belfastrevealed tonnes of material left out by people for recycling is instead incinerated each year.In the year to March , % of all local household waste was burned.Of the , tonnes of recycling collected by the roadside, around % was rejected and sent for energy recovery, ie incineration.The news emerged following a Channel  Dispatches programme that revealed some councils in the UK recycle less than % of the waste householders put out in bins.Defending the % figure, Environment Minister Edwin Poots said it is signicantly lower than other parts of the UK, and my department is working closely with councils and delivery partners to improve this fu rther..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadBelfast’s Methodist College receives £.m donation from past pupilFury as loyalists warn of ato violenceCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Indoor hospitality and foreign travel to resume as Executive agrees to lt restrictions Son of Martin McGuinness possible Sinn Fein candidate in Derry as party drops another MLA in pre-election reshuffle Sinn Fein’s Martina Anderson and Karen Mullen reject ‘scurrilous allegations’ of illegality in Derry Top VideosPlay#I wouldn#t rule violence off the table# LCC member tells NI Affairs CommitteePlayPrince Charles visits Co Tyrone village of CaledonPlayVideo: George Best son Calum says dad would have hated European Super league planLatest Northern IrelandBusinesses ‘will still struggle’ despiteof ind​​​​oor trade‘Signicant’ number of firearms seized in Co DownLisa SmythOpinionExecutive serves up a reason for us to raise a glass in celebration£m boost for Covid- recovery effortPortugal among countries included on NI#s green list for foreign travelLatestEx-Panorama producer says BBC should make it easier for whistleblowersSir Alex Ferguson film gets world premiere at Old TraffordMI chief accuses Facebook of giving a ‘free pass’ to terroristsBusinesses ‘will still struggle’ despiteof ind​​​​oor tradeSir Alex Ferguson film gets world premiere at Old Trafford,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

If you have bought there in the last few years, then you should be quids in as values have taken a huge leap in the past  months. It#s so popular that supply isn#t meeting demand, as people moving in are there to stay, meaning fewer properties coming onto the market. The few that have recently become available are so sought-after that they have prompted bidding wars. Average property values here rose by £, in the past year to £,, but local agent Neil Templeton reckons that#s a conservative figure. A director of Templeton Robinson Estate Agents, he says: It#s been a good market since we came out of the first lockdown in June of last year but it has been particularly busy since Easter. I think that#s because people are seeing light at the end of the tunnel now, with the number of Covid cases down and vaccines being rolled out. While some people will have a tough time ahead because of employment, others have been told their jobs are safe. The dynamic of what people are looking for has changed and generally people want more space internally and externally. Also a lot of people have been told by their bosses that they will continue to work from home for the foreseeable future. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBelmont FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBelmontPeople are attracted to this area by the great schools and many restaurants and shops and the close proximity of the City Airport. We also have something for everyone in terms of price brackets as there are houses from £, to £m.There are also people moving back home from England because they have the option of remote working. Neil says: They are looking for a better lestyle, a better education for their children, savings on school fees as well as a lower cost of living. These are people who maybe worked in London but have now been told they can work from home. We recently put a four-bedroom semi on the market at £, and had four bidders, three of them from England. The house sold for £,. The biggest increase has been in terraced properties, up by almost £, from £, to £,. He says better mortgage products - some at % LTV - have fuelled growth, especially for first-time buyers. If you can get your hands on a -% deposit then you can buy a terrace house in east Belfast and have mortgage payments which are lower than rent. People have been able to save money during the pandemic and a lot of first-time buyers are being assisted by their parents to get on the housing ladder. Semi-detached houses are at a premium, rising in price over the past year from £, to £,. Agents are now facing a shortage of houses and unabated demand. Neil says: There is very little land left to develop in east Belfast and generally people moving into the area are moving in to stay. Those already here don#t want to move so there aren#t enough properties for sale to meet demand. .app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadFury as loyalists warn of ato violenceBelfast’s Methodist College receives £.m donation from past pupilCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Indoor hospitality and foreign travel to resume as Executive agrees to lt restrictions Sinn Fein’s Martina Anderson and Karen Mullen reject ‘scurrilous allegations’ of illegality in Derry Son of Martin McGuinness possible Sinn Fein candidate in Derry as party drops another MLA in pre-election reshuffle Top VideosPlay#I wouldn#t rule violence off the table# LCC member tells NI Affairs CommitteePlayPrince Charles visits Co Tyrone village of CaledonPlayVideo: George Best son Calum says dad would have hated European Super league planLatest NewsEx-Panorama producer says BBC should make it easier for whistleblowersTonnes of Northern Ireland’s waste shipped as far away as Africa and AsiaMI chief accuses Facebook of giving a ‘free pass’ to terroristsBusinesses ‘will still struggle’ despiteof ind​​​​oor tradeSir Alex Ferguson film gets world premiere at Old TraffordLatestEx-Panorama producer says BBC should make it easier for whistleblowersSir Alex Ferguson film gets world premiere at Old TraffordTonnes of Northern Ireland’s waste shipped as far away as Africa and AsiaMI chief accuses Facebook of giving a ‘free pass’ to terroristsBusinesses ‘will still struggle’ despiteof ind​​​​oor trade,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchSocialsFacebookTwitterEmailThe Belfastis a member of IPSO and subscribes to its Editors Code of PracticeIpsoSitemapContact UsTerms  ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyPaid-for content PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with UsBelfastPension SchemeA MediahuisWebsitecopy Belfastdocument.documentElement.style.setPropertydocument.documentElement.style.setProperty Didomi.preferences\" href\"#\" style\"cursor: pointer position: fixed background:padding: px px color: #ffffff display: flex align-items: center max-height: px z-index:  bottom: px right: px border-top-left-radius: px border-top-right-radius: px\" Privacy"},{"url":null,"title":"ex panorama producer says bbc should make it easier for whistleblowers","story":"The BBC has been heavily criticised for how its  interview with Diana, Princess of Wales was obtained  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe BBC has been heavily criticised for how its  interview with Diana, Princess of Wales was obtained By Eleanor Cunningham and Keiran Southern, PAMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailFormer Panorama producer Mark Killick said the BBC’s response to Martin Bashir’s illicitly obtained interview with Diana, Princess of Wales opened the door to further scandals at the corporation.Mr Killick worked on the investigative journalism series at the time of the  interview and first alerted the BBC to the existence of the forged bank statements used to entice Diana.After blowing the whistle, Mr Killick said he was sacked from the programme due to “disloyalty” and then smeared by the broadcaster.Speaking after Lord Dyson’s damning report into the interview was published, he said what happened to him sent a message to other journalists at the BBC and prevented them speaking out.He told the PA news agency: “When the BBC dismissed us, run a smear campaign and then the cover up, lots and lots of people in the BBC at the time knew that.“And it sent a message to the whole of the BBC staff – don’t whistleblowthere’s a problem with the BBC. If you do you could lose your job.”While Mr Killick did not specy a subsequent scandal at the BBC, the corporation was heavily criticised for its handling of historic allegations against Jimmy Savile.If you look at the subsequent scandals the BBC had, the continuing thread is #surely people would have known #. And there#s a reason why people didn#t say, it#s becausethey did say, they were in danger of losing their jobMark KillickMr Killick added: “If you look at the subsequent scandals the BBC had, the continuing thread is ‘surely people would have known ’. And there’s a reason why people didn’t say, it’s becausethey did say, they were in danger of losing their job.”The producer said it was imperative Tim Davie, the BBC’s director-general, made it clear to the corporation’s staff they will be supportedthey blow the whistle and can “speak truth to power without being scared of losing their job”.He also demanded the broadcaster issue specic apologies to those harmed by the Bashir scandal.“So many people were hurt,” he said. “On the Diana side of the line there’s Diana’s employees, there’s the people who are named in the bank statements, there’s Earl Spencer, there’s Diana herself. And then on the BBC side of the line there’s the people who lost their jobs, that were smeared.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming de .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_-bc-d-ae-efecaad_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming de .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_-bc-d-ae-efecaad_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming de .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_-bc-d-ae-efecaad_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming de .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_-bc-d-ae-efecaad_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"The BBC has apologised to the royal family for how it obtained its  interview with Diana, Princess of Wales PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe BBC has apologised to the royal family for how it obtained its  interview with Diana, Princess of Wales Responding to the statement, Mr Davie said: “While today’s BBC has signicantly better processes and procedures, those that existed at the time should have prevented the interview being secured in this way. The BBC should have made greater effort to get to the bottom of what happened at the time and been more transparent about what it knew.“While the BBC cannot turn back the clock after a quarter of a century, we can make a full and unconditional apology. The BBC offers that today.”The broadcaster has published a document highlighting the steps it has taken since  to improve the conduct of its employees, protect whistleblowers and overhaul its complaints process.The BBC also said it would not keep the awards it won for Bashir’s interview with Diana.PATop VideosPlay#I wouldn#t rule violence off the table# LCC member tells NI Affairs CommitteePlayPrince Charles visits Co Tyrone village of CaledonPlayVideo: George Best son Calum says dad would have hated European Super league planLatest UKMI chief accuses Facebook of giving a ‘free pass’ to terroristsSir Alex Ferguson film gets world premiere at Old TraffordPfizer Covid- vaccine can be stored in fridge for a month, regulator saysThe Duke of Sussex’s full statement on the Lord Dyson reportThe Duke of Cambridge’s full statement on Lord Dyson’s report,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It could have been titled “Ulster’s foremost radical”, because she was, but sadly Ulster’s foremost radical had become Ulster’s almost forgotten radical.Isabella Tod was one of the most notable women in Ulster in the th century and is remembered as a social reformer, a suffragist, a campaigner for women’s rights and a liberal unionist.She was born in Scotland in  of an Ulster-Scots mother and a Scottish father but spent all her adult le in Belfast and described herself as an Ulsterwoman.She contributed to newspapers such as the Northern Whig and was an active member of the Presbyterian Church, but she is remembered especially as a pioneer in such fields as women’s rights, women’s health, women’s education and votes for women.Isabella Tod was involved in the campaign to amend the laws governing the property of married women and was the only woman called to give evidence to the  Select Committee Inquiry on Married Women’s Property, to which she gave evidence at Westminster on July , .This reflected the high esteem in which she was held as a social reformer across the British Isles.It also led her to recognise the importance of securing votes for women and, in , she founded the North of Ireland Women’s Suffrage Society.The society campaigned for votes for women and achieved its first success when an  Act granting city status to Belfast created a new municipal franchise which conferred the vote on persons, rather than men.That was  years before women where in Ireland gained the vote in local government elections.Along with many other progressive women, she was concerned about the abuse of alcohol and, in , with the support of Margaret Byers, the founder of Victoria College, she formed the Belfast Women’s Temperance Association and Christian Workers Union.The plight of women who had fallen into poverty and prostitution was a subject in which she took great interest. Out of this developed the Belfast Prison Gate Mission for Women, which provided support for women emerging from the prison system, and the Victoria Homes for Destitute Girls.Isabella Tod also sought equality for women in the field of education. She was secretary of the Belfast Ladies’ Institute, which provided educational classes for women, and campaigned successfully for Queen’s College Belfastto accept female students.She was also associated with the National Union for the Improving the Education of Women of all Classes.Her interests were regional, national and international. In , she was a contributor to the Journal of International Arbitration and Peace Association.Her last public appearance in Belfast was at a meeting to highlight the problem of genocide in Armenia.A devout Presbyterian and active member of Elmwood Presbyterian Church, she was a Liberal in politics, as indeed were many Presbyterian Ulster-Scots of that time.But she believed in the Union of Great Britain and Ireland and, when the Liberal Party split over the issue of Home Rule, she became an organiser for the Liberal Women’s Unionist Association in Belfast.Isabella Tod was representative of a progressive liberal unionism that was predominantly Presbyterian and Ulster-Scots and, during the last decade of her le, she spoke on unionist s across the United Kingdom.She was a remarkable woman, formidable, forceful, fearless and utterly faithful to the causes she espoused.The last two years of her le were hampered by poor health. When she died in December , at the age of , she was buried in Balmoral Cemetery.Isabella Tod was one of the most signicant Belfast women of all time a woman of national and, arguably, international importance and yet one who has been largely neglected by the city she called home.As Ulster’s foremost female social reformer, is it not time for her to be recognised as an iconic figure whose le and work should be an inspiration to young women today At present, there are conversations under way within Belfast City Council about statues and other commemorative representations in the City Hall.Surely the name of Isabella Tod should be part of that discussion .app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadFury as loyalists warn of ato violenceBelfast’s Methodist College receives £.m donation from past pupilCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Indoor hospitality and foreign travel to resume as Executive agrees to lt restrictions Sinn Fein’s Martina Anderson and Karen Mullen reject ‘scurrilous allegations’ of illegality in Derry Son of Martin McGuinness possible Sinn Fein candidate in Derry as party drops another MLA in pre-election reshuffle Top VideosPlay#I wouldn#t rule violence off the table# LCC member tells NI Affairs CommitteePlayPrince Charles visits Co Tyrone village of CaledonPlayVideo: George Best son Calum says dad would have hated European Super league planLatest NewsEx-Panorama producer says BBC should make it easier for whistleblowersTonnes of Northern Ireland’s waste shipped as far away as Africa and AsiaMI chief accuses Facebook of giving a ‘free pass’ to terroristsBusinesses ‘will still struggle’ despiteof ind​​​​oor tradeSir Alex Ferguson film gets world premiere at Old TraffordLatestEx-Panorama producer says BBC should make it easier for whistleblowersSir Alex Ferguson film gets world premiere at Old TraffordTonnes of Northern Ireland’s waste shipped as far away as Africa and AsiaMI chief accuses Facebook of giving a ‘free pass’ to terroristsBusinesses ‘will still struggle’ despiteof ind​​​​oor trade,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Derry News has learned that Lilian Seenoi-Barr has put her name forward to replace SDLP councillor Mary Durkan on Derry City  Strabane District Council. Ms Durkan stepped down from the local authority this week after two years in the role and the SDLP can co-opt someone to take her seat. Its understood that the deadline for nominations is tomorrow. When contacted by the Derry News yesterday, Mrs Seenoi-Barr, who is Director of Operations at North West Migrants Forum and has been one of the leading figures in the local Black Lives Matter campaign, confirmed that she has expressed an interest in standing as a councillor. googletag.cmd.push However, she said that it is a democratic process and as such she must wait to see who  puts their name forward. One party insider indicated that it is quite likely Mrs Seenoi-Barr will be selected. The SDLP was asked whether any other candidates have emerged and when the party will make a formal announcement. However, no response was received at the time of publication. In a surprise move, Ms Durkan, who topped the poll in Foyleside in the  local elections, announced her intentions to stand down ‘in light of the limitations in party structures’. At the local elections in , Mrs Seenoi-Barr narrowly missed out on being elected in the Foyleside ward. googletag.cmd.push She has  years of experience working in the community, with a focus on human rights and social justice in Kenya and Northern Ireland. Her work began in Kenya fighting for Maasai women and girls’ rights - advocating for the eradication of Female Genital Mutilation , early forced marriages and access to free primary education for deprived communities. She emigrated to Derry in  and since then has been involved in promoting and protecting minority rights in Northern Ireland through political engagement, dispute resolution and reconciliation. At first, Mrs Seenoi-Barr struggled to integrate due to the lack of services and support for migrant, refugees and asylum seekers in the city.     Determined that other Black and Minority Ethnic residents should have better support, she worked to establish and build the North-West Migrants Forum. Despite a harsh economic climate, she secured funding and sustained a migrant centre in the city, increasing visibility of and a leline for migrants. She has been a prominent figure in the local Black Lives Matter Movement, highlighting racial inequality in the North. Following the murder of black American man, George Floyd, a rally was organised by Mrs Seenoi-Barr in Derry.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Staff from Rosemount Resource Centre have written a letter of no confidence to Derry City  Strabane District Council which questions the suitability of a ‘new management committee’. Ten workers who signed the no confidence letter say they have provided a collective  years’ service to the local community. A list of grievances and concerns are laid out in the letter over two and a half pages. They include allegations of bullying and harassment in the workplace, mis-use of funding, closed Annual General Meetings , concerns of ‘family collusion’ and a lack of knowledge in terms of financial reports. googletag.cmd.push In addition, it details the removal of committee members from an investigating  to ‘manipulate the outcome of grievances’, ‘victimisation’ of staff and exclusion of the community from decision-making. The letter says that all complaints can be backed up with emails, minutes and testimonials. “Staff are now feeling unhappy, vulnerable and threatened to be in their place of work. “This is having a devastating impact on our health, leading to us being unsure of what our future holds as community workers,” the letter adds. In conclusion, the staff say the situation will not be tolerated any more. The Derry News has since viewed correspondence from management which was sent to signatories of the ‘no confidence’ letter. googletag.cmd.push They have been called to an investigation in relation to their ‘participation in a letter sent to public representatives and others containing serious allegations’. It aims to establish facts and gather evidence relating to the allegations.

Mourners at the service in Our Lady of Mercy Church in Lavey heard how Catherine showered the children she taught with love and was devoted to her family. Officiating at the funeral, parish priest Fr Eamon Graham said she was a beautul person. “If I was to mention this morning all the people who Catherine loved and who she in turn was loved by, we would be here all day,” he told the congregation. “The past few days I was trying to think how I would sum up Catherine she was beautul inside and outside, in every aspect of le. googletag.cmd.push “She loved all the good things in le. She always had her hair done and presented herself better than any of the rest of us. “Behind that, it wasnt a facade. It was a reflection of the goodness within her. She lived her le in a wonderful way.” Fr Graham told those gathered in the church how Catherine had doted over her many nieces and nephews, and encouraged them to keep her memory alive by following her example. Her love of both those in her family and the children she taught was central to her le, a le in which her faith was strong. googletag.cmd.push “You know every child she ever taught, because she brought all the childrens bothers and woes home. She loved the children she taught, particularly in Creggan,” he said. “She had a special love of her godchildren because her faith was important. She loved God deeply and many people are closer to God today because they encountered Catherine.” A proud Lavey woman, she was deeply involved in the local community. She attended the local primary school and was steeped in the areas GAA tradition. “In our own parish, Catherine was so involved in the GAA, the camogie. She was a pupil at our school and the teachers remembered her as a pupil and a student teacher,” said Fr Graham.     “When she was dealing with student teachers, she always went the extra mile. Teaching wasnt just a job for her, it was a vocation. “She was a perfectionist in every way possible, but she missed her mummy. It is our hope, prayer and belief that she is with her mother and with God.” Erins Own GAC led their own tribute to Catherine online. “Lavey GAC is greatly shocked and saddened to learn of the untimely death of our former senior camogie player, Catherine McCann,” they said. “Today and forever well remember Catherine McCann. Every team with Catherine on it was a better team.” Catherine taught for  years in Creggan Primary School, near Randalstown, County Antrim, and the school paid tribute to her kindness. “Miss Mc Cann taught in our school for  years. She was a model teacher in every way, always putting her pupils first,” they said. “An amazing friend to all the staff and parents and her displays of kindness to everyone she met came so naturally. “She always arrived to school dressed in the latest fashion and then quickly pulled the trainers on her to deliver sports lessons in her lovely pink trainers. “We cannot even begin to realise the void that is left in Creggan Primary School.” Concluding the homily at her funeral mass, Fr Graham said she had touched the le of every person she encountered. “I cant sum up Catherine – I wouldnt even try to – but the thought thats in my head is that she wove a thread of gold through le,” he said. “It touched every person she encountered and it was made out of love. Its up to the rest of us to take up that thread and bring it through le. “Thats the greatest tribute everybody can give.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Derry News has learned that Home Bargains is keen on opening a new outlet on the large Waterside site. The Lisnagelvin Leisure Centre site was put up for sale last year by its owners Derry City and Strabane District Council with an asking price of pound,. It is understood that there was strong interest in the site from potential buyers. However, the council has confirmed that a preferred bidder has been approved by the councils Business and Culture Committee. That decision will now need to be ratied at the councils full monthly meeting later this month before the final details of the sale can be processed. googletag.cmd.push While all those involved in the sale of the key Waterside site are remaining tight-lipped, the Derry News understands that the preferred bidder would see Home Bargains opening a new store on the site. This would involve the demolition of the former leisure centre building and the construction of the new store. The Derry News contacted Home Bargains, who already have a store at Strand Road in Derry, about their plans for further expansion in the city. However, a spokesperson for the company said they were not able to comment at this time. A spokesperson for the local council said a report was brought before the Business and Culture Committee last week in confidential business seeking members approval for the appointment of the preferred bidder for the purchase and development of the Lisnagelvin site. googletag.cmd.push “This decision will come before Full Council for full ratication at the end of the month,” the spokesperson said. “Once ratied Councils legal services team will engage with the successful bidder to commence legal formalities for the disposal and development of the site in accordance with the Conditions of Sale set out in the tender documents.” ​Lisnagelvin Leisure Centre closed several years ago. The leisure centre was hugely popular with generations of young people in the city, especially because of its swimming pool and its famous wave machine. Since being closed, the building has been empty and there has been much debate about the future use of the large site.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Former Desertmartin, Glen and Derry player Emma Kelly took over as the Saffrons manager on the eve of the new season. She played camogie for Ballinascreen and football with Desertmartin alongside current Derry players Nuala Brown and Tomaisina Cassidy. When the Martins folded for a season, she played for Glen with current Derry players Caoimhe Kirkpatrickand Danielle Kivlehan. In the Derry colours, she soldiered with Ciara Moore who is still part of Odhran McNeillys Oakleaf plans. When it looked like Derry werent going to have a team, she moved to play for the Saffrons and was later part of their  All-Ireland junior winning team. googletag.cmd.push After not being part of manager Dee McConvilles plans for this season, she had resigned herself to the fact her county career was over, while still playing for St Pauls, to whom she transferred when moving to Belfast for work. When McConville stepped down as manager on the cusp of the league, Kellys phone was hopping with players urging her to take the job, followed by a call from the Antrim Chairperson asking her to take on the role in an interim basis. “So it is sort of forced retirement...I am hardly going to put myself on,” Kelly jokes. “I turned  last month, so it was about time somebody stepped into the roleanyway. googletag.cmd.push “I coached most of the senior squad going up through underage,” Kelly said of her time in charge of ious Antrim Development squads. Kelly enlisted the help of Down All-Ireland winning forward Kyla Trainor as Head Coach and the duo got to work with a trial process to get a squad of players drawn up for the new season. Now confirmed as manager, Emma looks ahead to a five year plan of development. “We opened up the trials to every club, regardless of ision. If girls want to trial for a county team, then they should be given the opportunity and it was the same in Derry when I was playing,” Kelly points out.     She listed Antrim and Derry under the same umbrella, sleeping giants of the ladies game. There is youthful tinge to the Saffrons squad. There are five current minors on board, with a group of talented players still in their first year of minor left to their own grade and to focus on their studies for now. “With me out, Cathy Carey is the oldest...she ticks that box now,” laughs Emma. “The next oldest would be  or , so we have a range all the way down to  or , so it is a good mix.” Going down the years, there wouldve been a core of players putting their shoulder to the wheel of Antrim football. Others, came and went, with some coming in at the last minute on the basis of a reputation earned where. The new management duo have a dferent outlook, based on their experiences on squads down the years. “We know what we hated when we were playing, you dont like people walking into ,” Kelly states. “We have stamped that out. If youre not committing,you havent havent been at training and havent told us...youre gone. It is as simple of that.” The starting team and squad will be picked based on Antrim performances. The seven of her St Pauls clubmates have been told they will be judged on their commitment and application to the county. “I dont care who you think you are or what you think you are, were out to win and put the best team out,” Kelly adds. “You will be taken off and put on as we see fit and I think they are buying into it. There is a buzz, that things are going to be done right and people arent going to walk out. “We are putting changes in place that we have girls there who want to play for the county. We have  girls who will commit to being there, they mightnt be the best  in the county talent wise, butyou are the best in the county that are going to commit and work together at bringing the county on, thats the way we are going.” Emma, who works in Sports Development, looks on the Antrim job as a five-year project. Getting out of Division  figures in her thoughts. “We obviously want to compete this year, we came in late but there is a good buzz and a lot of talent there, so we will hopefully compete well. It is a building process and there is a lot of talented young girls coming though. “Theyll be playing along with the likes ofMcFarland, Tosh , Cathyand Aine Tubridy, who will all bring them along in the setup.” Derry and Antrim will meet in the Ulster final later in the season and Sunday will be a marker on how the season will fare out. With a mixture of both counties, in opposite corners, it will be an interesting Sunday ahead. LISTEN: Interview with Derrys Anna Frizelle.

That was the last we heard from him.ldquoI was listening to the news all afternoon to hearthere was anything happening. It wasnrsquot until pm that night when I was listening to the RTE news that I heard a priest had been shot in Ballymurphy.Mr Mullan knew in his gut that it was his brother, but could not bring himself to tell his parents, John and Mary.ldquoAll that was said that he was shot, it didnrsquot say he was dead. He was actually dead within  minutes of being shot, he continued.ldquoWe were phoned around am and I found out he was dead. I called the doctor just in case my mother would get badly upset and she was badly upset after the doctor told her. I couldnrsquot bring myself to tell her.ldquoMy father was up the stairs and couldnrsquot come down the stairs but he knew it was bad news.Mr Mullan said it took the Ballymurphy families a few years to organise in order to campaign for truth and justice as a  inquest recorded an open verdict in all the deaths.He has been involved with the campaign for a new inquest for over  years, travelling to Dublin and Brussels and beyond on order to plead the familiesrsquo case.Mr Mullan, his niece Geraldine McGrattan and son Hugh had been regular attenders over the  days the inquest was held.The family, including Mr Mullanrsquos late sister Teresa, lived for a time on the Strand, beside the Portaferry Hotel.While Mr Mulllan took after his father and spent his working le fishing, Fr Mullan spent a year in the Merchant Navy before opting to go to Queenrsquos University and then Maynooth College to train to be a priest.He served for a time at St Josephrsquos Church in Killough before moving to Dunloy for nine years. While his funeral was held in Belfast, he was buried in St Patrickrsquos graveyard in Portaferry.ldquoHugh baptised all my family, he married me and my we Mary, so he was very close to us all, said Mr Mullan.He recalled how his brother loved to sail in Strangford Lough and entertain his family or parishioners by singing along to his guitar.But most of all, Mr Mullan mourns what his brother could have done for others.ldquoHugh was the type of priest who needed to be among people all the time, helping people, he said.ldquoHe was someone who would have given anyone anything he had, even his last penny. He particularly liked to help young people and loved working and encouraging them.ldquoIf he had have got a chance in Ballymurphy, he would have helped the people no end to help themselves. Thatrsquos what he aimed to do with people and was always thinking of dferent things that he could start.Mr Mullan thanked everybody who had called him or send cards over the week and in particular, local priest, Fr Feargal McGrady, for his help and support over the years.Mr Mullanrsquos granddaughter, Mairead OrsquoHare, added: ldquoThese families have fought so tirelessly over the years to get justice for their loved ones, it has been both inspiring and heartbreaking to watch.ldquoI never met my great-uncle, but the stories my Granda tells regularly make his presence known and you can easily tell that the love my Granda has for his brother has never ceased.ldquoHe has known for the last  years that his brother was innocent, he didnrsquot need a coronerrsquos ruling to know that, but having Fr Mullan declared innocent to the entire world has brought much needed comfort and peace..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-World.jpg","title":"‘World knows Hugh was innocent’  ","story":"THE family of Ballymurphy Massacre victim Fr Hugh Mullan have welcomed a coronerrsquos ruling that he was an innocent ldquopeacemaker.The Portaferry priest was shot dead by soldiers as he tended to a wounded man on waste ground in west Belfast on August  .Fr Mullan and nine others shot dead were all exonerated in an inquest ruling by a coroner last week.At the time the Army reported that the nine men and one woman who died were Republican gunmen killed in crossfire.The first to die over the three days of shooting, Fr Mullan had only served a a church for seven months.Mrs Justice Keegan said in her findings that he was ldquounarmed, not acting in any way as a threat, attending to a wounded man in the field and waving a white object as a sign of his peaceful intentions.ldquoHe died as a result of gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen. The shooting of the deceased has not been justied by the State. The use of force by the Army that resulted in his death was disproportionate.Fr Mullanrsquos youngest brother, Patsy, said that he and the rest of his family always knew the  year-old priest was innocent.Now , he said the first learnt something was wrong when he heard that a priest had been shot in Ballymurphy that day on the RTE late news.ldquoI knew right away it would be him, he was the type of person and would be out to help anyone in trouble or who was injured. That was just his nature. Unfortunately it was his downfall, said Mr Mullan, who still lives in Portaferry.ldquoHugh was the type of priest who would have been among people all the time, helping people.ldquoHe was someone who would have given anyone anything he had, even his last penny.Mr Mullan was left unimpressed with an apology that Prime Minister Boris Johnston made in a call to former First Minister Arlene Foster.ldquoI wouldnrsquot have wanted an apology from him actually. I donrsquot have much time for him at the best of times because I donrsquot think hersquos the best person for that job.Mr Mullan, his niece Geraldine McGrattan, his son Hugh and other family members attended nearly all  days the inquest since it started in November .Mrs McGrattan said that hearing the judgersquos findings ldquolted a weight of me.ldquoIrsquove known for the past  years that Hugh was innocent but now the world knows, she said.ldquoTo hear him call him a peacemaker was very touching.

This means that plastic litter in the sea is just adding up and, globally, we are adding a truck load full every minute, she continued.ldquoThat is a lot of plastic and, on top of looking bad, it is harmful to sea plants and animals. Every year, plastic kills , sea animals and over a million sea birds. It is a big problem.During last weekrsquos launch event in Ardglass, a number of fishermen told Jenny how sad they were to see how much litter is in the sea and that they have noticed an increase in the amount of it in during their letimes.ldquoIt also takes their valuable time at sea to clear from their nets and can potentially contaminate their catch, so the new scheme is a win-win for them to do their part in getting rid of it.Describing the new project as ldquoinnovative, Jenny said it has already been successful where with fishermen bringing marine litter caught in their nets back to shore.She said the Harbour Authority provides durable bags for the litter to be collected in and that once landed onshore, it is sent off to be recycled or otherwise disposed of.ldquoThis is how our fishermen in Northern Ireland are reducing the marine plastic problem at sea, Jenny explained. ldquoThe thing that makes this project so unique is that fishermen are almost the only people who have access to litter that is out in the open water or at the seabed.ldquoStopping waste entering the sea is imperative, but taking litter out of the sea is too, even though it is more challenging. That is exactly what lsquofishing for litterrsquo fishermen do.Jenny praised the fishermen in Ardglass who have signed up to the scheme as did local councillor, Dermot Curran.ldquoThis is a great scheme and anything which can help reduce the amount of marine litter being washed ashore is to be welcomed, he said.ldquoTen Ardglass skippers have already signed up for the scheme and I hope that there will be more. This is a great new initiative but we also have to look at how litter gets into the sea in the first place which poses problems for trawler skippers as this waste gets tangled up in their nest which is time-consuming and a distraction they could well do without, he said.ldquoThe Fishery Harbour Authority is to be congratulated for bringing this initiative to the Co Down ports and the more skippers that sign up for lsquofishing for litterrsquo the better. The scheme can help protect the environment and reduce the amount of unsightly litter being washed up along the shoreline..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-Business.jpg","title":"Business support programme helps secure 78 jobs in district  ","story":"A COUNCIL-LED local business support programme has created  jobs in the last  months.According to new figures released, the Business Growth and Tender for Growth programmes facilitated by Newry, Mourne and Down District Council have helped to create an average of one new job each week.The programmes are part-funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern Irelandprogramme.Despite the impact of recent lockdowns over the last  months, NMD Business has continued to provide SMEs with support packages in response to challenges created by the pandemic.This has resulted in ongoing growth for the business and the creation of  new job roles, as well as helping  businesses involved in the programme to navigate an unprecedented economic environment.Participants in the programme are able to avail of one-to-one mentoring from leading experts, who help guide them and their business through unprecedented times, as well as learning new skills in financial management, cross-border sales and maximising your chances of winning tenders.As a result, many businesses have been able to not only grow their business, but grow their workforce.Sara Velasquez, from Ecoplastic in Downpatrick, completed the programme last year and has already recruited four new staff for the business.Her firm designs and makes all kinds of structures from % recycled material, from boardwalks to street furniture, bridges to bike trails and picnic tables.She said: ldquoThe NMD Business programme helped us focus on the most lucrative areas for growth for our business.ldquoOur dedicated mentor provided us with expert guidance which allowed us to respond quickly to a new market environment, giving us confidence that decisions we were taking were anchored in good commercial sense, while the workshops equipped us with new skills that will stand us in good stead into the future.ldquoSales have since increased as a result and we continue to work on exciting projects across Ireland and the UK.

They have been allowed to continue for too long.ldquoPotentially using body cams and CCTV to apprehend offenders is welcome but, as I have consistently argued, there is a need to beef up existing legislation and work alongside other bodies to examine how they have successfully dealt with the problem.The politician said everyone had a responsibility and a duty of care to make sure their rubbish doesnrsquot end up being illegally dumped and to clean up after their pets.ldquoThere is simply no excuse for not doing so, Cllr Walker declared. ldquoWhile most people dispose of their waste properly and clean the mess that their pets create, there are many who donrsquot, caring little for the environment, the districtrsquos appearance or the cost of cleaning up after them. We need affirmative action so those who blatantly disregard the law are made accountable.Cllr Walker said dog dirt posed a major health risk to children who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.He added: ldquoWhile the council has been told that the DNA testing of dog dirt is not feasible as the local authority has no legal power to insist that dog owners register for the service, we still have to get to grips with this issue.ldquoThe enforcement improvement plan is welcome, but it would be so much easier of dog owners cleaned up after their pets.

It was a four-lap course which started at Greenisland Golf Club and carried on via Monkstown Wood, Shore Road and then a bit of a challenge with a hill to contend with on Station Road.The weather was grey with a little drizzle but nothing to cause major problems and in fact Declan felt that there was a slight wind assistance on the climb which was welcome.The overall winner Chris Denton, was the only runner to break three hours and he took top spot on the podium with a time of two hours and  minutes.Declan was more than happy with his own time of . and the fact that he placed seventh overall.

footpaths.SAINTFIELD ndash A councillor has this week called for planning officials to ensure a Saintfield primary school has enough room to expand to meet future demand.Mr Robert Burgess says there is increasing concern among teachers and parents that plans to build  new homes at the rear of the Academy Primary School could prevent its future expansion.He said that in addition to restricting the growth of the Listooder Road school, the planned new homes would result in a major increase in traffic in the area which would impact on the safety of young children.Mr Burgess said the safety of the pupils is the schoolrsquos number one concern and confirmed its officials have been in contact with local planners over the past number of months.He said the safety of pupils is already jeopardised as

There will also be increased emphasis on ensuring that public toilets meet the needs of those with autism, dementia and other health conditions.The new toilet strategy mdash which includes a review of how council-owned toilets are managed, cleaned and maintained mdash is expected to be formally signed off at tonightrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee.Across the district, the local authority is responsible for  public conveniences, many of which have been in place for over  years and are showing signs of corrosion and internal wear and tear. A number have also been vandalised.Councillors will be told tonight that a decision is required to repair, replace or remove these particular units and they will be provided with a detailed breakdown of the work that is required.Toilets at Castlewellanrsquos Upper Square need to be replaced while the outer shell of the building would remain in place, while the existing facility at Market Street in Downpatrick would be entirely replaced.The new strategy suggests that the current public toilets at The Rocks in Ballyhornan would be replaced as would existing toilets at the local authority-owned car park at the Newcastle Road outside Dundrum.Plans have also been drawn up to replace toilets at Crossgarrsquos Lislea Drive and at Ardglass harbour, while public toilets at the New Line in Saintfield mdash which have been repeatedly targeted by vandals mdash would replaced, alongside those at the Quoile Road in Downpatrick.Public toilets the Lough Inch cemetery in Ballynahinch and Struell Cemetery in Downpatrick are also in line for refurbishment under the new council strategy, alongside conveniences at Windmill Street in Ballynahinch.It will also be confirmed at tonightrsquos council meeting that almost  people responded to a -week consultation on the new strategy with over  percent of those who responded agreeing with the suggestion to pay to spend a penny.

My uncle was the first to be shot, then Frank Quinn, the  year-old, who was shot beside him and killed.What hurt Geraldine and the wider Mullan family so much was in press reports Fr Mullan was said to have been involved in a gun battle with soldiers.ldquoHe was such a big part of our family le, for the lies that were told about him were very dficult for us all, she said. ldquoIt was hard enough to lose him, but to lose him like that and then everything afterward was so hard.She said on that fateful day, her uncle had been trying all day to calm things down.ldquoThere was trouble from Loyalists behind Springfield Park and the people in Springfield Park started to evacuate their houses and tried to flee across a piece of waste ground over to Moyard to safety.ldquoBricks and stones were being thrown at their houses and houses were badly damaged. They were carrying children across the waste ground and firing started. A man, Bobby Clarke, was shot and wounded in a field and local people called for a priest as they thought he was going to die.ldquoUncle Hugh had been standing outside his own house and had spent the day ringing the Army, trying to get thing quietened and calmed. He called the Army to tell them that he was going out to the wasteland to help an injured man. Then he got a white cloth, began to wave it and went out onto the wasteland.ldquoHe got to Bobby and he told Uncle Hugh he wasnrsquot too bad. Uncle Hugh said he would go and get him an ambulance but would give him the Anointing of the Sick to help him anyway.ldquoHe did that and he was making his way back to get an ambulance when he was shot. He was shot at least twice and left in the field. Frank Quinn went out to help Uncle Hugh and he was shot and died instantly.The family never received any official explanation about Fr Mullanrsquos death.ldquoIn the early days, we were told that Uncle Hugh had been killed in crossfire during a gun battle, said Mrs McGrattan. ldquoNewspapers reported that he was a gunman, carrying a weapon. No one ever contacted us, there was never a person at the door to tell us what had happened.Along with the joy from last Tuesday of the coronerrsquos ruling that Fr Mullan was an innocent, Mrs McGrattan said there was also a lot of sadness for her.ldquoIt was a sad day as my grandparents, John and Mary, werenrsquot there to hear it, nor were my parents, Teresa and Gerry, my husband Gerard and my brother Hugh Kearney. So many of us have died in those  years and didnrsquot get to hear the good words she used.There was another loss for her family mdash her mother Teresarsquos baby died at birth and her parents moved to England shortly afterwards.Mrs McGrattan said she was really moved to hear the testimonies of civilian witnesses who gave evidence during the inquest.ldquoWhenever Mrs Justice Keegan said that Hughrsquos story was stark and in her opinion, he was a peacemaker, and totally innocent, it lted a weight off me.ldquoIrsquove known for the past  years that Hugh was innocent but now the world knows. To hear him call him a peacemaker was very touching. It was though that I had been coiled up in a tight spring and suddenly just released. It was a great day.She praised and thanked the Portaferry community for their support over the years.ldquoThe people of Portaferry were so generous and so kind to the whole family at that time, actually all through the years. The community held Uncle Hugh in great respect and always have done..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12625712.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is celebrated on Sunday, May .In their joint message, the bishops opened by quoting a verse from the book of Acts in the Bible: \"All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability - Acts :.\"They continued: \"One of the great marks of the first Pentecost was the ability the Holy Spirit gave the apostles to speak across barriers of language of the works of God.ldquoThe Spirit today gives the people of God the same ability to speak as one across all kinds of barriers and boundaries.ldquoWe rejoice today that we can speak together to both our church communities and beyond with a common message of hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.\"Stating their disappointment that for a second year they are unable to mark this \"great feast\" by coming together for their Ecumenical Service of Prayer, as they have done for almost  years, the bishops added: \"This service allows us to give thanks and praise together to God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Please God, next year this might again be possible.\"They continued their message by noting how speaking together about \"the goodness of God\" across barriers is an \"important expression of the language of hope\".They said: \"This is so important as we begin the journey of recovery from the impact of coronavirus. There has been much suffering the loss of loved ones, illness, financial challenge and isolation.ldquoWe all need to hear the healing and strengthening words of Christ, lsquoCome unto me all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you restrsquo.\"Outlining how during the pandemic people quickly realised how important communication is when denied simple non-verbal qualities of close contact and touch, the bishops said: \"We discovered how much we need the warmth of the love of our family and friends.ldquoThe telephone and internet became our key means of keeping in touch and we thank God for these technological aids that kept us connected.ldquoCrucially, we learned how much we are indebted to medical staff, nurses, key workers and volunteers who have communicated dedication, care and love to the community through their skill and acts of kindness.\"We must continue to communicate the language of love and hope across all barriers and boundaries.ldquoIt would be so easy after this long period of restrictions to move to despair and lose hope. Yet we believe there are signs of new le all around us in the vaccination programme and the good response to public health guidance.ldquoLet us encourage one another to communicate the hope that by Godrsquos help, our common le will slowly , and together seek his grace to renew our lives.\"In closing, the bishops said: \"We pray that the Holy Spirit of Pentecost may inspire us so that we communicate in our words and deeds the hope we have in God.ldquoMay we as Christian people speak of our belief in the transforming power of God, and by his Spirit to work together for the rebuilding and re-energising of our churches and society.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The DUP ‘family’ ignored his last column, and refused to make him leaderI wanted to make sure they were all proper, true, reliable friends and not Christopher Stalfords.Christopher is the ‘friend’ of Arlene Foster who helped to oust her, neglected to talk to her in advance of the coup, and has failed to phone her since her resignation. The rough and tumble of friendship eh    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Given Edwin Poots’ traditional religious beliefs, two groups of people will be disappointed he is the new leader — nationalists and paleontologistsI’m not saying Arlene is being given the cold shoulder by her former colleagues but they are treating her like she was Neil Lennon at a Rangers street party.Christopher said the DUP operates as a family — clearly the Sopranos rather than the Waltons. Anyway, the DUP ‘family’ ignored my last column, refused to make me leader and instead had an election last week. They counted all the votes and the people have spoken!!So well done Edwin. Your election means the DUP now says No Surrender to science!Well, three dozen of them spoke. And Edwin beat Jeffrey by  votes to  votes. If it had been  votes each apparently it would have gone to an Irish League penalty shoot-out where you get extra marks for stepping over the line. Andit was still a draw after that, it would have gone to a march-off. God knows what Protestant teachers they would impart to Catholic children in biologyNineteen out of  amounts to exactly % of the votes. And as we all know from recent experience % of a vote is a ringing endorsement of any project. So it is highly unlikely that anything could possibly go wrong for the DUP. Part of me is delighted that Jeffrey didn’t get the job. I mean I do like to recycle gags but I remember doing my first ever ‘Jeffrey Donaldson looks like Daniel O’Donnell’ joke  years ago and there were people still doing it last week online. So well done Edwin.There are however two groups of people who will be bitterly disappointed that Edwin is the new leader — nationalists and paleontologists. Oh and astro-physicists. And geologists. And fans of the Big Bang Theory — the sitcom and the actual theory. Yes, it’s official, the DUP now says No Surrender to science. Brendan Behan famously said that the first item on in the agenda of every Irish republican party was the split. Unionists tend to avoid formal splits but they are in a state of flux. The DUP is unlikely to split.And the TUV can’t split, on the grounds that a split requires members to form two factions and the TUV have barely enough for one. In factJim Allister wants to retire, according to party rules, he has to tender his resignation to Stephen Nolan. And the UUP won’t split. To be fair they have had quite a smooth leadership transition from Steve Aitken to Doug Beattie. Remember Steve  Steve joined Arlene several weeks ago in demanding that the PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne must resign for alleged incompetence. Of course the irony of someone being accused of being no good at their job by two MLAs surely deserves more than ‘pot, kettle, black’. And as a sign of the contemporary power and influence of unionism, sure enough, six weeks after demanding that Simon resign both Arlene and Steve had resigned. Schadenfreude is an ugly emotion butI were Simon Byrne I’d be dancing round my office singing ‘Arlene’s on fire’ and ‘Ste-vie lives in a sunken submarine’. So Doug is now the new UUP leader and is determined to attract more liberal voters to the party. In fact he’s already renamed UUP headquarters the Edward Carson Wellness Centre. He was going to get Meghan and Harry to open it until he realised that they were separatists rather than unionists.• We can’t have Protestants teaching their chemistry in Catholic schoolsOn the plus side, there were things to celebrate this week.Northern Ireland has reached a million vaccinations. A million! This is a great achievement. Robin Swann should be walking like a man who’s  feet tall. Or six feet. Or over five feet anyway.And two Northern Ireland men, Brendan Rodgers and Jonny Evans, won the FA Cup — there were a few other people involved but it was basically them. Plus the Northern Ireland Assembly finally voted to remove the loophole that meant that schools could legally discriminate on religious grounds when appointing teachers. It was revealed this week that only % of teachers in Catholic schools are Protestant and % of teachers in mainly Protestant schools are Catholic.To be fair this % is still more than when I went to my Catholic schools. It’s % more than when I went. I’m all for integrated education but I can’t help being concerned that removing this loophole could be unhelpful.We can’t have Protestants running around Catholic schools teaching their Protestant French and their Protestant chemistry. It doesn’t bear thinking about what they would get up to in the history lessons. And God knows what filth they would impart to the good Catholic children in biology.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityNasir Adam - Plaid CymruRaised in Butetown, the son and grandson of merchant navy, Irsquove lived in Cardf South my whole le and itrsquos where I still work and live and itrsquos here Irsquom raising my family. During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area. Wales has  constituencies, with each being represented by one MS in the Senedd. Constituency votes are counted in a first past the post system - so the candidate with the most votes is elected.     Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are also around  to  cases of the India iant in parts of Scotland, including Glasgow, with these cases again connected to travel.The India Covid iant, officially known as B.., was first detected in India in October.It has been designated a ldquoiant of concern by PHE as it is thought to be at least as transmissible as the iant detected in Kent last year, known as B, which is now dominant in the UK.PHE said there is currently no evidence to suggest that the new Indian iant is more serious than previous mutations, nor is there evidence which indicates that this version of the Indian iant is resistant to current vaccines.Health experts said they ldquohavenrsquot seen any hint of a current Covid iant that can fully evade the effectiveness of vaccines.On Wednesday , the European Medicines Agency said it was ldquopretty confident that vaccines currently in use will be effective against the Indian iant, a view that has been echoed by some British scientists.However, Professor James Naismith from the University of Oxford said not enough is known to say for sure whether the iant could frustrate the UKrsquos vaccination programme.Speaking on BBC Radio rsquos Today programme, he said: ldquoThe vaccines donrsquot  per cent prevent infection for people.ldquoWhat they do is, they almost  per cent prevent hospitalisation and serious illness.ldquoWe donrsquot know enough to know yet whether the Indian strain will behave dferently than that.ldquoSo even the regular virus can infect people who have been vaccinated and sometimes you do get reinfection.Could the iant delay lockdown ending The growing number of India Covid iant cases in the UK has sparked concerns that the lting of lockdown restrictions, which is set for  June in England, could now be delayed.Ministers have also not ruled out re-introducing local lockdowns in areas where the iant of concern is increasing.Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said that the government will make decisions based on the data, and measures will be eased ldquoat a pace and in a way which is safe.Symptoms to look forThe main symptoms of coronavirus to look for include:a high temperature ndash this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back a new, continuous cough ndash this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing episodes in  hours a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste ndash this means youve noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste dferent to normalMost people with symptoms have at least one of these symptoms, although some do not experience any. As such, it is advised that everyone gets tested regularly to help prevent further spread of the virus. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments are closed on this article. -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt was girl power when ten female walkers joined Joy and sheepdog Bracken from Penarth and District Ramblers at Penarth clftop for an . mile walk, with no stiles only gates and which would see them experiencing the weather of all four seasons in one day. They set off on a socially distanced walk in lovely spring sunshine across the old pitch and putt course before joining part of the old railway line, now a walk and cycle way, and heading through a built up area Lavernock Road led them into Cosmeston Country Park.Past the eastern lake with its floating jetty where canoes can be safely launched and making their way through the eastern paddock with its carpet of pretty cowslips, open meadows led them towards Old Cogan Hall Farm, where they deviated into the churchyard of St Peterrsquos for morning break in glorious warm sunshine reminiscent of summer. Admiring the herring bone masonry which dates to Celtic and Saxon times and the ancient yew trees that could even pre-date this lovely old church, which allegedly is the oldest building in Penarth and hearing some of its long and interesting history, it fell into disrepair in the th century. By the th century the ruinous building was a cattle shelter until the latter part of the rsquos when the rd Marquis of Bute was persuaded to pay for its renovation.Mile Road built by the Bute family led them to the western paddock and through the sun-dappled Cogan Wood to re-enter fields where a footbridge led them across the Sully Brook for the short climb up to Home Farm, with its glorious views towards the eastern end of Barry and the surrounding farmland. Exiting through a gate, some road walking in a southerly direction brought them into Sully village and pounding pavements to reach the Jubilee Hall and the cricket field, the full beauty of Sully Bay with its views across the Bristol Channel towards the Somerset coastline and Hayes Point to the west confronted them.     With the wind beginning to pick up they tramped by track and field to the public slipway at Sully beach and stopped for lunch utilising rocks for seating whilst gazing eastwards towards Sully Island and Flat and Steep Holm beyond, as clouds thickened overhead and the temperature dropped making it feel more like autumn.Time to move on along part of the long distance Wales Coast Path, through the playing fields to exit onto Beach Road, following it to the car park of the Captainrsquos We where there were only a few people sitting at outdoor tables for food and drink, not really enjoyable in the cool breeze.The fairly quiet St Maryrsquos Well Bay Road brought them up past The Bay Caravan Park and into fields with growing crops where, without any warning a sudden short sharp shower of rain engulfed the group forcing coats to be swtly donned.Crossing a wooden footbridge into the delightful Lavernock Nature Reserve the grassy path led them into the remains of the WW gun emplacements. Initially in the late rsquos the original Lavernock Gun Battery was built to protect the Bristol and Cardf shipyards and the Bristol Channel, but unfortunately most of the original buildings now lie underneath the caravan park.Being bombarded by a short hail storm whilst moving on through the nature reserve, lovingly cared for by volunteers and passing the man-made pond with its surrounding carpet of bluish violet bugle, a plant which attracts moths, butterflies and bees, before exiting onto Fort Road their route led them past the Marconi Holiday Village and the Church of St Lawrence before heading along the clftop. With thick black clouds heading up the English side of the Bristol Channel, the race was on to get back before the rain hit. As the weather turned wintry and the wind increased, a huge shower of hailstones and heavy rain struck them on the open Penarth clftop soaking them as they made their way back to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits before, during and after lockdown on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Health Minister Robin Swannsaid: “This announcement today will be welcome news for those within the age range and is a further testament to the successful delivery of the vaccination programme in Northern Ireland. Vaccination is vital in helping us move through this pandemic and there is no doubt that there are people in Northern Ireland alive today because they have been vaccinated. “Next week we will see further easing of restrictions with the re-opening of licensed and unlicensed premises indoors, the remainder of tourist accommodation and the further relaxation to the rules over visiting indoors. This has been made possible because of the success of the vaccination programme and the majority of people acting on the public health advice. Iappeal to everyone who is eligible for the vaccine to book an appointment. I know there are some younger people that think they don’t need the vaccine but we have seen what this virus can do and with iants now in the mix we all need to protect ourselves and those around us. Chief Medical Officer, Dr Michael McBride added: “While the risk of severe disease is lower in younger people, some may get very sick. There is much we still have to learn about this virus and post COVID syndrome or “long COVID”, which can be very debilitating for some. In making the decision to get the vaccine you are protecting not only yourself, but also those that matter to you. Every vaccine really does bring us closer, together. People making bookings are asked to be patient, as demand for appointments is expected to be strong. The ongoing roll-out of the vaccination programme will continue to be dependent on the availability of vaccine supplies.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aaeedbfcceaef   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eedbacadeaf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
