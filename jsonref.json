They are due for release next year, when the Queen will celebrate her Platinum Jubilee to mark 70 years on the throne. In February a spokesperson for Meghan Markle and Prince Harry confirmed the couple were expecting a second child together. The couple shared their announcement - aptly on Valentine\u0027s Day - by posting a black and white image of Harry resting his hand on Meghan\u0027s head as she lay in his lap underneath a tree.\u0027The photograph of the Duke and Duchess was was taken by the couple\u0027s longtime friend Misan Harriman. What wonderful news for the Sussexes!!\u0027 their spokesperson added. Lilibet – whose middle name is Diana – was born at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in June.    It is understood the Queen was informed by Prince Harry that her great grandchild would be named in her honour, ahead of their official announcement which was made on their official website. However, Buckingham Palace appeared to be caught off guard by the timing of the Sussexes\u0027 news with a spokesman for the palace congratulating the couple 90 minutes after the announcement broke.    Omid Scobie, a journalist favoured by Harry and Meghan, later tweeted that the couple would \u0027not be sharing a photograph at this time\u0027 of Lilibet and that they were now on \u0027parental leave\u0027. He said the couple\u0027s office was encouraging anyone who wanted to send gifts to support organisations working for women and girls. The name Lilibet was coined by the Queen and used by her younger sister Margaret and their parents. George VI once said: \u0027Lilibet is my pride. Margaret is my joy.\u0027Lilibet arrived six days before what would have been the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s 100th birthday."},{"url":null,"title":"Elon Musk slashes price Bay Area mansion 5 5m 32m vowing rid possessions","story":"Share this articleBloomberg - Are you a robot?Elon Musk and Grimes break up after three years together"},{"url":null,"title":"The rise middle class migration Families flying Mexico getting cab border","story":"Share this articleMiddle-Class Migrants Fly to Mexico and Then Cross U.S. Border Illegally - WSJ"},{"url":null,"title":"Rishi Sunak says confident gifts tree Christmas","story":"Share this article   Asked about Christmas, he said: \u0027I\u0027m confident people will be able to get their toys for Christmas.

The carbon centre of gravity is calculated by taking an average of each country’s latitude and longitude, weighted by their annual emissions. The most polluting countries exert the strongest gravitational pull on the centre of emissions. At the beginning of the 20th century the industrial powerhouses of the US, UK and north-western Europe were responsible for the majority of emissions. By the end of the second world war, the global centre of emissions was located a mere 25 miles off the east coast of the US. Since then, rising industrialisation in Asia – led by China – has dragged the centre of emissions more than 7,000 miles eastwards. It is now located on the Tibetan plateau in western China. This representation should not be interpreted as suggesting that the population of China produces a disproportionate amount of CO2. On a per-capita basis, 36 countries had higher carbon emissions in 2020. But the centre of gravity does highlight the importance of getting large emitters such as the US and China to commit to stronger climate policies at the Cop26 summit. New modelling from the International Energy Agency suggests carbon emissions have peaked in the world’s wealthiest economies –⁠ including in Europe and the US –⁠ but are likely to rise in less developed countries over the next decade. This is under a stated policies scenario, which considers current and announced climate policies from governments around the world. To limit global warming to 2C, governments would need to drastically raise their ambition, shutting fossil fuel power plants while ramping up investment in renewable energy and electric cars.

The government stopped normal commercial flights abroad when the pandemic struck last year, but it has since been gradually relaxing the restrictions.  The flight bans dealt a heavy blow to Russia’s airlines, according to Reuters. In the Islamist-controlled northwest - home to around 4 million people, the majority of whom have been displaced by fighting in other parts of the country - the number of cases doubled in September compared to August, reaching 73,000, according to Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).  Cases are also increasing at a worrying pace in the northeast, where western-backed Kurdish forces are in charge. In the last week of September, an average of 342 people in northeast Syria tested positive each day - the highest daily number since the pandemic began.   The area only has one testing laboratory, leading healthcare workers to fear the true caseload is much higher.  Both the northeast and northwest are running out of oxygen supplies, hospital beds and testing kits, the charity warned on Thursday, in a call for urgent assistance from international donors.  We start with the news that the Republic of Ireland has raised doubts over its plans to drop almost all Covid restrictions next week due to a rise in cases. Finance minister Paschal Donohoe has admitted a full return of office workers was now unlikely, according to the Reuters news agency. With hospitalisations ticking up, though still far below peaks this year and last, ministers will discuss at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday whether this will push up critical care needs ahead of the busy winter period. After one of Europe’s toughest lockdowns, the government had planned to let nightclubs open for the first time in 20 months from 22 October, with other venues back at full capacity, and a requirement for vaccine certificates in bars and restaurants dropped. Foreign minister Simon Coveney told the Newstalk radio station: Asked if there would be a major return of workers next week following last month’s gradual reopening of offices, Donohoe said that was “a little less likely”.That is it from me, Martin Belam, today. I will be back tomorrow. Andrew Sparrow is covering Covid in the UK in his live blog today, as it is somewhat bound up with Sajid Javid’s comments and push for access to GPs. You can find that here. It is currently leading with a warning from chief medical officer Chris Whitty that the NHS faces ‘exceptionally difficult’ winter even without Covid spikes. Tom Ambrose will be here shortly to take you through the rest of the day’s global Covid news. I am off to host the comments in this week’s edition of the Thursday quiz.31,299 new cases is the country’s highest one-day infection tally since the pandemic began, and a jump of around 2,500 higher than the day before. Reuters report the country also recorded 986 deaths, a slight increment on the record set yesterday. Russian president Vladimir Putin has called for the nation to accelerate its vaccination programme. Currently around a third of Russians are vaccinated, and the health minister revealed this week that over one million people are currently being treated in Russia for Covid symptoms.Only one-third of parents plan to vaccinate their children as soon as the vaccines are ready, the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation has found. Another third of those surveyed want to wait and see how the rollout goes. “What’s going to be actually more challenging, beyond having the infrastructure to be able to administer the Covid-19 vaccines, is ensuring that parents feel comfortable vaccinating their children,” Syra Madad, an infectious disease physician and senior director of the System-wide Special Pathogens Program at NYC Health + Hospitals, told the . About half of children 12 and older have been vaccinated in the months since the vaccines were given the green light for those ages. Vaccinating people of all ages is a crucial part of ending the pandemic, said Dr Saad Omer, an infectious disease epidemiologist and director of the Yale Institute for Global Health. “We will not be able to get out of this pandemic without vaccinating children – both for their own sake and for the sake of having overall protection,” he added.

Most activities are back to normal and India has administered almost a billion vaccine doses, with around 75 percent of people receiving at least one shot. India’s peak holiday season includes Durga Puja, Dussehra and Diwali - major Hindu festivals celebrated with noise, colour and exuberance across the country. In Kolkata on Thursday, crowds flocked to colourful “pandals”, temporary structures where idols of the Hindu goddess Durga are installed during the festivities. Traffic police in the West Bengal state’s capital used loudspeakers to remind people about physical distancing, but in vain, although many people wore masks. “It’s festival time so people will come and people will enjoy. Now there are no restrictions, the government has allowed us (to celebrate) so we are enjoying out here,” Aradhana Gupta told AFP. Another reveller Riya Tai rued how she could not celebrate the festival last year when strict virus restrictions were in place. “I am feeling happy (this time) although the crowd is excessive. I am sweating like hell but still I am enjoying it,” she said. On Monday, prime minister Narendra Modi’s government kicked off a campaign dubbed “Mission 100 Days”, with fears that the long festive season could see a resurgence of Covid-19. “We are asking states to be extra vigilant during the next 100 days, and ensure that Covid-appropriate behaviour is observed,” a government official was quoted as saying by the Hindustan Times newspaper. “Only then we will be able to save the country from an expected surge in cases.”PA Media report he told the BBC radio show, when asked about mistakes the government might have made in handling Covid: “I have been in this job for 100 days and was out of government when a lot of those crucial decisions were made. I was a humble backbencher.” He did offer an apology of sorts, saying: “What I am saying sorry for is the loss that people have suffered and how they have been affected. I don’t think I am in a position yet to go back and look at every decision that was made and how we can learn from that.” The health secretary then revealed that he has not read the report on the coronavirus pandemic, which he is in charge of dealing with. He told listeners “It is one report and I welcome the report. I haven’t had the opportunity to study every word of the report. I will study it properly this weekend,” he said.Besides Russia’s Sputnik, Hungary plans to produce China’s Sinopharm’s vaccine in the planned $193m (£140m) vaccine plant. Earlier Hungary reported 1,141 new infections, with the number rising above 1,000 for the first time during the fourth wave of the pandemic.It is the subject of our Today in Focus podcast today. While the daily commute has returned for many, it is not everyone and not every day. Instead a new form of hybrid working has emerged as a popular alternative: half a week in the office and half at home. But it is not working for everyone. Last week the prime minister suggested in his party conference speech that Britain needs a further push to get back to the office full-time. In Today in Focus,  business reporter Joanna Partridge tells Rachel Humphreys that there could be other unintended consequences of retaining remote working permanently. In many cases, it will be those who have childcare or other caring responsibilities who decide to work more from home and in many cases this still means women. And as the gender pay gap continues to grow, this could set women back further. On the other hand, a workforce less concentrated in big cities could help the government’s highest-profile policy initiative of “levelling up” living standards and wages across the country.

Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine.

Photograph: Karl MageePublicans have said it would be unfair to penalise entire sectors because “some people are opting to remain unvaccinated”.“It doesn’t seem in any way proportionate that entire sections should be penalised because some people are choosing not to take the vaccine. Already this speculation is having an appalling impact on businesses, staff and suppliers who were all focused on reopening in a week’s time,” said Licensed Fintners Association (LVA) chief executive Donall O’Keeffe.Doubt has been cast over the planned easing of almost all restrictions from Friday of next week , including the reopening of nightclubs and requirement to provide proof of vaccination or immunity to access events. Under the current roadmap for the reopening of society, most remaining restrictions are due to be eased from October 22nd. These include requirements for physical distancing, requirements for mask wearing outdoors and indoors in private settings, and limits on numbers at indoor and outdoor events and activities.Restrictions on religious or civil ceremonies would also be permitted to resume without limits on numbers under the plan, as well as limits on numbers that can meet in private homes or gardens. Certification or vaccination, immunity or testing as a prerequisite for access to events, with exception of international travel, would no longer be required under the plan, and high-risk activities like nightclubs would be allowed to resume. Measures that would remain in place regardless of a full reopening would include self isolation when we have symptoms and mask wearing in healthcare settings, indoor retail and public transport. However, a full reopening is now in doubt as escalating covid infections and risks to the health system have caused concerns among officials. Senior officials and political aides were on Wednesday briefed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) that the path of infection had taken an unexpected negative turn, and that all key indicators of the disease were now performing badly.“Late night venues such as nightclubs and late bars are yet to reopen. The rest of our sector is still operating under severe restrictions, even though indoor service is limited to those who have been vaccinated,” Mr O’Keeffe said.The budget arithmetic would “need to be reworked” if there are any further delays, he added, as the supports for the sector were based on the full resumption of activity. The Taoiseach said the trajectory of the disease had taken a ‘wrong turn’ and there was no guarantee almost all restrictions would be lifted on October 22nd as planned. With nightclubs among the ‘high-risk activities’ due to resume from October 22nd, a nightclub operator in Dublin has said he is devastated at the lack of clarity about the reopening of the industry next week. Ian Redmond runs the Tramline nightclub in the city centre, which has been closed for 581 days, since March 2020.Speaking on RTE’s Morning Ireland, he said “We are just devastated… the amount of work that has gone into this… I just want certainty and clarity from the Government, we deserve this,” he said.“It is just not fair,” he added. Meanwhile, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said it was “a little less likely” that there would be a widespread return to the workplace on October 22nd.“We will have to see where we are with the disease,” he told the Pat Kenny Show on Newstalk.It is understood that no official decisions have been made yet as to the plans for reopening.

Budget documents show how €49 million that was expected to be used to help the agriculture sector to decarbonise will instead be used to help fund welfare payments targeting those at risk of fuel poverty.A carbon tax increase of €7.50 per tonne of CO2, combined with rising energy costs, saw the Government move to increase the fuel allowance payment by €5 to €33 per week in Budget 2022.Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue has promised that the full €1.5 billion in decarbonising incentives for farmers will be delivered over the course of future budgets.Budget documents note that the €1.5 billion will still be made available during 2021-2030 and a future scheme will form part of the suite of programmes under the new Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) due to start in 2023.However, the deferral of the use of €49 million in funds for farming has sparked criticism among the Opposition and in the farming community.Sligo-Leitrim Independent TD Marian Harkin is critical of the overall package for agriculture in the budget. She said the purpose of the carbon tax was to incentivise people to change behaviour as part of the fight against climate change and to use part of the receipts to help decarbonise farming. “Not doing that makes a complete mockery of what carbon tax is about in the first place,” Ms Harkin told The . She questioned if the Department of Agriculture was ready to introduce incentives for greener farming next year and raised concerns that this money would only start to flow once the new CAP starts in 2023.“In the meantime how are farmers expected to deliver cuts in emissions?” she asked.Irish Farmers’ Association (IFA) president Tim Cullinan claimed the Government had reneged on a commitment to allocate to the sector a portion of the €1.5 billion carbon tax money in the budget. He said “it will further rock farmer confidence in the programme for government commitment on the allocation of the carbon tax, which is also costing farmers a lot of money”.A spokesman for Mr McConalogue responding to the points made by Ms Harkin and Mr Cullinan, said, “The needs of the Department of Agriculture for 2022 were met without recourse to carbon tax. This is simply a matter of scheduling. “The Minister will shortly be announcing indicative allocations for a new CAP Strategic Plan for the period 2023 to 2028, and funding for this programme will be supplemented by significant carbon tax revenues.”"},{"url":null,"title":"eu offers to drop 80 of border checks to meet british demands","story":"European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic said that the ECJ had only been first raised by Britain as a problem this July, long after the Protocol had been agreed and entered into force. Video: EUA sign on a lamppost near Larne Port calls for the Northern Ireland protocol to be dropped. File photograph: Mark MarlowBloombergMost checks on goods from Britain destined for Northern Irish supermarket shelves would be dropped and half of customs formalities slashed under new proposals unveiled by the European Commission.Drawn up in a bid to ease the implementation of the North’s post-Brexit arrangements and settle the issue in the face of British calls for change, the proposals were based on discussions with local civic and business stakeholders.“We have completely turned our rules upside down and inside out” to find solutions, commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic said as he unveiled four papers laying the groundwork for discussions with London.“I think that it’s quite obvious that we are really doing our utmost. And I hope that this will be reciprocated by our UK partners.”The proposals include a change to EU law to allow medicines to continue to be seamlessly distributed from British hubs special exceptions for trade in meat goods deemed to be important to “national identity” express lanes, and formal structures to involve Northern Irish stakeholders and authorities in overseeing the arrangements.As much as 80 per cent of checks on retail goods originating in Britain would be abolished under the plans, which were pushed through by Sefcovic despite reservations by some EU member states and officials within the commission who feared they went too far.If the proposals are to come into force however, the commission will require Britain to fully implement aspects of the protocol that it had agreed to but has yet to enact, such as sharing real-time customs data and building permanent border infrastructure.The papers are expected to form the basis of talks with Britain in the coming weeks or months, with the EU expressing hope that the matter could be settled by the end of the year.Britain’s Brexit minister David Frost had warned in a speech on the eve of the launch that his government could not accept any proposals that retained the European Court of Justice’s (ECJ) oversight of the EU regulations that apply to Northern Ireland.It is a demand seen as impossible for Brussels to concede, as it underpins the EU’s legal order, and Sefcovic said it had not been raised during the protocol negotiations and had hardly featured as an issue on his recent visit to Northern Ireland to meet with stakeholders.“In all these discussions, the issue of the European Court of Justice was mentioned once,” he told journalists, adding that he first heard it mentioned in July.UK sources have insisted that the ECJ is an intrinsic part of the problem with the protocol, which they describe as too discredited among the unionist community to be salvageable in its current form.“Significant changes which tackle the fundamental issues at the heart of the protocol, including governance, must be made if we are to agree a durable settlement which commands support in Northern Ireland,” a UK government spokeswoman said in response to the launch.The proposals were welcomed by the Government, with Taoiseach Micheál Martin describing them as a “serious response to the challenges and concerns that have arisen”, while Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said they were “far-reaching proposals that comprehensively address the practical, genuine issues that matter most” to the people of Northern Ireland.Industry figures in the North said it was clear that the commission had taken their suggestions on board. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the ideas “go further than many expected”, while UUP leader Doug Beattie said the EU “has moved significantly”.Democratic Unionist Party leader Jeffrey Donaldson said the proposals “clearly fall a long way short”, though he welcomed them as an “acknowledgement that the NI protocol has not worked” and backed efforts to find more far-reaching solutions in the coming talks.

Video: EUEuropean Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic: The proposals began life in his engagements with Northern Irish stakeholders on a visit there in September. Photograph: Aris OikonomouAFP via Getty ImagesThe nod from the member states came late. Hours before the release of the proposals to adjust the Northern Ireland protocol, it was still unclear whether all capitals would give their approval.The move to eliminate 80 per cent of checks on goods from Britain destined for Northern Irish supermarket shelves, to slash customs formalities, and exceptionally to allow unfrozen meat products into the single market due to reasons of national sensitivity, arguably opens up a gap in protecting European Union agriculture and, officials admit, creates an opportunity for cross-border smuggling.To offer it, the EU’s Brexit point man Maros Sefcovic had to overcome the reservations of member states including France, long wary of the risk of plant and animal diseases entering the single market via Britain and threatening its agriculture industry, and already in a stand-off with London over fishing licences that makes it reluctant to be seen to reward British brinkmanship with concessions.\u0026nbspSefcovic also had to overcome resistance within the European Commission, among officials who work on food, animal and plant safety and on fair competition under the French internal market commissioner Thierry Breton.“The lawyers have been at it for months,” a diplomat recalled, describing “blood on the floor” in the confrontations over the matter. “The commission is pushing at the very edge of what is accepted by member states.”The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has trashed its relationships on the continent. Even Irish officials, who once enjoyed special insight into Whitehall due to long personal and cultural links, are estranged from the true motivations of London.Cummings tweetA throwaway line explaining how Britain could agree arrangements for Northern Ireland only to ditch them later in former Downing Street svengali Dominic Cummings’s latest Twitter screed crystalised the impression London has given its allies: “good faith blah . . . cheating foreigners is a core part of the job”.To win the support of member states, the EU’s package was presented not as a cave-in to this deeply unpopular regime, but as an adaptation to a very different group, one seen as much more sympathetic and pragmatic: the people of Northern Ireland themselves.The four papers began life in Sefcovic’s engagements with Northern Irish stakeholders, particularly the industry collective the Northern Ireland Business Brexit Working Group, and in a trip to Northern Ireland in September to listen face-to-face.What the commission heard was appeals for practical adjustments to ease the implementation on the ground, for stability and predictability. To work within the protocol – a hard-fought solution to the conundrum posed by a Brexit that a majority in Northern Ireland did not ask for – not to jettison it.Industry figures have indicated that they recognise in the EU proposals a response to their demands, and that indeed the measures go further than what they could have hoped for.Unfortunately for them however, these fixes are not the sole gift of the EU to give. They require London: British authorities must implement aspects of the protocol that were agreed but never enacted, such as sharing real-time customs data, labelling NI-only goods with stickers, and building permanent border infrastructure, as part of the package.Equally, proposals by the EU to formalise direct links with Northern Irish authorities and stakeholders and involve them in oversight of the package through parliamentary and committee structures require the British government to acquiesce.ECJ issueIn a speech on the eve of the EU’s announcement, Britain’s Brexit minister David Frost repeated a demand he knows that Brussels cannot concede: that the role of the European Court of Justice be removed in overseeing the EU regulations that apply in the North.This was seen in Brussels as a piece of political theatre, arranged last minute in a bid to blunt the impact of the EU’s proposals.British sources insist that the ECJ goes to the heart of the problems with the protocol. Yet it did not feature as a problem when the text was negotiated and agreed, and only emerged as a demand this July, long after the deal came into force.The adoption of the principle of opposition to the ECJ by a handful of the unionist politicians closest to the Brexiteer camp – described as “latter-day converts” to the issue by one person close to the talks – is viewed as a risky strategy.“History shows Boris Johnson can change his mind very quickly, and defend his new position as if he had never believed anything else,” one official mused.“When will the DUP realise they shouldn’t tie themselves to Brexiteers?

A recent report by the Northern Health Science Alliance found we northerners were more likely to die from Covid-19, spent nearly a month-and-a-half more in lockdowns, suffered worse mental health and were made poorer than the rest of England during the first year of the pandemic.This week’s hugely critical report by MPs in Parliament’s Science and Technology and Health and Social Care committees highlighted the incompetence of this Government in its preparedness for a pandemic, but what was not stressed was that here in the North we were a sitting duck for Covid-19.Before the pandemic, data frequently pointed to geographical inequities in health (and so our ability to fight serious illness). And now, in perhaps the most devastating empirical evidence to date, that disparity has been laid bare.A report published today by Imperial College London reveals that life expectancy fell by up to three years in areas of the North in the 17 years before the pandemic, leaving people more vulnerable to Covid.For example, in Leeds female life expectancy fell from 78.7 to 75.6 between 2002 and 2019. For men, the biggest drop was in Blackpool, where longevity declined to 68.3 years.They are both cities which – living in Manchester as I do – I know well and visit frequently. It is astonishing to think that only around 200 miles away, a woman in Camden has a life expectancy of over 95. Men who live in Kensington and Chelsea have a similar life expectancy – or, to put it bleakly, enjoy 27 years more life than men in Blackpool.It’s welcome that Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, in a recent keynote speech in Blackpool (he must be glad he lives down South) pledged to tackle “the disease of disparity” as part of the levelling-up agenda. Yet the deep-rooted regional inequalities in health across England have long been cause for alarm. Spiralling hospitalisation and mortality rates caused by Covid simply exposed them for all to see.The question is: what is to be done, considering the scale of the challenge?Of course it makes sense to look at geographical imbalance in the NHS and public health services. But addressing such disparities is pointless without robust social and economic policies to underpin drives to improve Northern health.The Government has to ask why the South has a younger population with healthier lifestyles. Certainly legions of young people – my own twentysomething sons included – have migrated South for improved opportunities. And with their well paid jobs, such young workers can afford fresh fruit and gym membership. Certainly poverty, paucity of opportunity and overcrowded housing in the North does plenty to explain how the pandemic played out geographically. Not least for those with low-paid roles who couldn`t work from home. Covid was pushing on an open door. The Office for Health Improvement and Disparities was launched at the beginning of October with the aim of tackling health inequalities across the country. This is only half the answer. Educating people away from fags and booze isn`t enough. Rather than hoping the impact of a rebooted economy and revitalised big business will spread to the North, we need initiatives to help the local private sector create more opportunities. We need more affordable housing, better job prospects – promoted through devolved initiatives.Theo Rashid, the lead author of the Imperial study, said: “A system that cannot protect lives in normal times inevitably struggles to protect people during a pandemic.”In that we all agree. Levelling up cannot just be a sound bite. It must be a prescription for saving lives.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Doctors accuse Sajid Javid of being \u0026#39frit\u0026#39 after he cancels GP conference speech A masterpiece worthy of MonetNorway bow and arrow attacker was Muslim convert known to policeInsulate Britain says it will suspend its campaign after breaking High Court injunctionAnglican Bishop who criticised direction of Church of England converts to CatholicismPrince George \u0026#39annoyed\u0026#39 rubbish keeps appearing after he goes litter picking, Prince William revealsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rampant misuse apostrophes has consequences","story":"Where, if I may ask, Dear Reader, do you stand on apostrophe’s? Sorry, sorry! I swear I won’t do it again. Just seeing it on the page gives me a visceral feeling of fingernails-down-a-blackboard horror. Not funny. Sorry again.I only did it to make a point, namely that grammar really matters. Those who care about it, do so deeply. Those who don’t used to be in the ascendancy – but no longer, thanks to a court case in Australia where a costly civil trial pivots on an apostrophe. How fabulous is that? I couldn’t be more cock-a-hoop if Lynne Truss herself came to tea – even if she eats, shoots and leaves.Interestingly, the nub of the issue is an apostrophe causing mayhem in absentia. To whit an estate agent posted remarks on Facebook about his former employer. These included a reference to the expensive properties on the firm’s books, followed by the qualifier “but can’t pay his employees superannuation. Shame on you Stuart!!! The estate agent claims he meant to write “pay his employee’s superannuation”. This cut no ice with his former employer, who felt the implication was that he had failed to pay “his employees’ superannuation” and wants to sue for defamation. The judge agreed there was a case to answer, saying: “To fail to pay one employee’s superannuation entitlement might be seen as unfortunate to fail to pay some or all of them looks deliberate.”Frankly, I’d sentence him to life for all those exclamation marks, but the salutary plight of the Apostrophe One is the ultimate endorsement of traditional education with its nitpicking emphasis on correct practice. After years of sloppy indifference towards punctuation et al, a new primary grammar curriculum was introduced in England in 2014 – whereupon parents like me raised a cheer. Catholic guilt gets a bad rap, but to their credit, back in my day the Irish nuns (holy) waterboarded us with concepts including subjunctives, the gerund and never using a preposition to end a sentence with.Once the fundamentals are mastered the truth is that there’s great delight to be had in language. Its structural rules are no more onerous and every bit as sensible as those laid down for cricket, Monopoly or flying a plane. Quite simply, syntax is the scaffolding that enables others to understand what we mean and thus makes language accessible and universal.As for those stereotypes about “grammar Nazis”, frankly it ill behoves the wilfully illiterate to equate entirely justified attention to detail with authoritarianism. Last time I checked, Fowler’s Modern English Usage bore vanishingly little resemblance to Mein Kampf, not least because the latter was riddled with grammatical errors.Language, of course, evolves. Why, I have learned to joyfully embrace the split infinitive.

In 2010, five bishops quit the church because of their dissatisfaction regarding the introduction of women bishops. The Catholic Bishops Conference of England and Wales confirmed that Dr Michael Nazir-Ali, was received into the full communion of the Catholic Church by Monsignor Keith Newton on the Feast of St Michael and All Angels. With the permission of the Holy See, he will be ordained to the Catholic priesthood for the Ordinariate in due course.Dr Nazir-Ali added: “I believe that the Anglican desire to adhere to apostolic, patristic and conciliar teaching can now best be maintained in the Ordinariate.“Provisions there to safeguard legitimate Anglican patrimony are very encouraging and, I believe, that such patrimony in its Liturgy, approaches to biblical study, pastoral commitment to the community, methods of moral theology and much else besides has a great deal to offer the wider Church.“I am looking forward to receiving from the riches of other parts of the Church, while perhaps making a modest contribution to the maintenance and enhancement of Anglican patrimony within the wider fellowship.”He was born in Pakistan in 1949 and has both British and Pakistani citizenship. He also holds many academic awards including from the Universities of Karachi, Oxford andCambridge, as well as a Lambeth Doctor of Divinity.He has taught and researched at a number of institutions and continues to teach and supervise research. He was ordained an Anglican priest in 1976 and served in England and Pakistan before being consecrated Bishop of Raiwind in 1984.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Doctors accuse Sajid Javid of being \u0026#39frit\u0026#39 after he cancels GP conference speech A masterpiece worthy of MonetNorway bow and arrow attacker was Muslim convert known to policeInsulate Britain says it will suspend its campaign after breaking High Court injunctionPrince George \u0026#39annoyed\u0026#39 rubbish keeps appearing after he goes litter picking, Prince William revealsFrance and Germany fear EU\u0026#39s Northern Ireland Protocol plan could threaten Single MarketMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"chance catching covid rises almost 60pc three six months full","story":"The chance of testing positive for Covid after being double jabbed rises by nearly 60 per cent in the months following vaccination, with experts saying boosters are needed to keep immunity high.The latest data from Imperial College\u0027s React survey, which monitors community infection levels, found prevalence among fully vaccinated people in the three months after their second jab was around one in 285 – 0.35 per cent.However, between three and six months it rose to one in 181, a 57 per cent increase. The risk is still far less than for unvaccinated people, among  1.76 per cent, or one in 56, were found to have the virus.Prof Paul Elliott, the director of the React programme, said: The positivity rate for two doses within six months is higher than that for less than three months.So there\u0027s some suggestion that maybe there is a higher rate of breakthrough infection after three months and we can\u0027t really say what happens after that. It definitely shows incentive for people to get their booster when it becomes available.The study also showed that overall Covid prevalence increased in September to 0.83 per cent, or one in 120. The previous survey by Imperial in July found that one in 169 people tested positive for the virus.Combined vaccine effectiveness against any infection was estimated to be 62.8 per cent and 66.4 per cent for those with symptoms. The study also showed a higher prevalence in school aged children and households with children.Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, said: The phenomenal progress of our vaccination programme has built a strong wall of defence across the country, allowing us to live safely with this virus.These findings show how important it is for young people to get the jab to protect them from Covid-19, and for those eligible to get their booster vaccine to prolong their existing protection. I urge anyone who needs one to get a jab as soon as possible – it\u0027s vital to keep you and your family safe this winter.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Doctors accuse Sajid Javid of being \u0026#39frit\u0026#39 after he cancels GP conference speech A masterpiece worthy of MonetNorway bow and arrow attacker was Muslim convert known to policeInsulate Britain says it will suspend its campaign after breaking High Court injunctionAnglican Bishop who criticised direction of Church of England converts to CatholicismPrince George \u0026#39annoyed\u0026#39 rubbish keeps appearing after he goes litter picking, Prince William revealsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"insulate britain suspend campaign october 25","story":"Climate group Insulate Britain has said it will stop blocking roads amid the looming threat of prison sentences after breaking a High Court injunction.The eco-protesters will today hand in a letter to the Prime Minister calling off their actions after Wednesday\u0027s blocking on the M25, the 13th time they have blocked England\u0027s motorway network.The group, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, said in a letter delivered to Downing Street today, that it would be halting its campaign of civil resistance until Monday 25 October.Fighting broke out at the group\u0027s latest stunt on Wednesday, with demonstrators dragged off the roads by drivers near a busy industrial estate in Essex.Around 20 protesters blocked the junction to St Clements Way and London Road, in Thurrock, forcing multiple vehicles including HGVs to stop and turn round.Motorists ripped banners out of the hands of demonstrators as they sat and lay in the road. Others had glued themselves to the road, causing long queues of cars.Regarding its protests, the said: We cannot imagine undertaking such acts in normal circumstances. But the dire reality of our situation has to be faced.In an apparent gesture of good will to Boris Johnson, the group said that it is calling off its actions in light of the speech made by the Prime Minister to the UN ahead of Cop26.The speech last month said: We are approaching that critical turning point – in less than two months – when we must show that we are capable of learning, and maturing, and finally taking responsibility for the destruction we are inflicting, not just upon our planet but ourselves.Insulate Britain said that ahead of the climate conference at the end of the month, we ask you to use this time to signal that you believe what you say.The  has been told by Insulate Britain that they believe around 50 of its activists have broken a High Court injunction which prohibited the blocking of England\u0027s motorway network.Activists who have been arrested by police over the last month of protests have been released under investigation for offences such as obstruction and conspiracy to commit public nuisance.The group previously admitted its actions on the M25 were in breach of the injunction obtained by the Government last month.People who break injunctions can be found to be in contempt of court, but the protests continued as prosecutions usually take several months.Breaking a High Court injunction, however, means that activists could face up to two years in prison if they are found guilty of contempt of court for breaking the order.Insulate Britain, an offshoot of environmental campaign group Extinction Rebellion, has now staged similar protests 13 times.The group has blocked parts of major roads around London, including the M25 and M4, to draw attention to climate change.Transport for London (TfL) was previously granted High Court injunctions against the group to prevent them further obstructing traffic - which apply to 14 locations around the capital.The injunctions were extended to the end of next month on Tuesday, prompting members of the group to burn the court orders outside the Royal Courts of Justice in central London.One of the group\u0027s spokesmen - Liam Norton - was previously a spokesman for Extinction Rebellion.He was cut off on GB on Wednesday morning by presenter Mercy Muroki after she accused him of dodging her question.Despite the arrests and frustrated responses of commuters the group said other members of the public have praised its actions.Dr Diana Warner, an Insulate Britain supporter, said: Many people are going out of their way to thank us. Some come out of their cars to thank us, some are police officers involved with our arrests.To them, we bring hope - we haven\u0027t yet given up.

It said the app would help people access services more easily, instead of having to go through multiple online processes and repeated sign-ins, as well as having to remember multiple usernames and passwords. Mr Barclay said the new app had been created in response to the pandemic and heightened public expectations for accessing Government services online.  The NHS App has gained more than  million new users in recent months since becoming the  for accessing vaccine passports needed for travel. But holidaymakers expressed fury this week when the app went down, meaning some travellers missed their flights as they could not access their vaccine passports.

Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Olney told the Mirror: Given the Governmentaposs dodgy record with apps, I doubt many people will be holding their breath on this one. Hopefully the process will be cheaper than the £ billion of taxpayersapos money wasted on Test and Trace.

The isive former No aide said Boris Johnson always intended to tear up the agreement - which he hailed as a great deal during the  election.But Mr Cummings said the PM never had a scoobydoo about what the agreement actually meant, as he continued his war of words against his old boss. Irish Deputy PM Leo Varadkar said the comments were alarming and warned world leaders against making trade agreements with the UK. He told RTE: Surely the message must go out to all countries around the world that this is a British government that doesnapost necessarily keep its word and doesnapost necessarily honour the agreements it makes.  And you shouldnapost make any agreements with them until such time as youaposre confident that they keep their promises, and honour things, for example, like the protocol.The UKaposs Brexit chief Lord Frost has piled pressure on Brussels to rewrite a key part of the deal governing trade in Northern Ireland. But he confessed on Tuesday that the Government only signed the pact so they could tell voters they had got Brexit done. Mr Johnson repeatedly boasted that the agreement negotiated with Brussels was a great deal that was oven ready to be signed.In a series of tweets, Mr Cummings said: What Iaposve said does NOT mean aposthe PM was lying in General Election apos, he never had a scoobydoo what the deal he signed meant.He never understood what leaving Customs Union meant until November . Mr Cummings, who was a key player in the Vote Leave campaign, has become a ferocious critic of his former ally Boris Johnson, who he often derides as a shopping trolley careering from side to side. He said the Government wriggled through with best option we could and intended to get the trolley [Boris Johnson] to ditch bits we didnapost like after whacking [Jeremy] Corbyn. Mr Cummings was a key player in Downing Street until November , and remains a isive figure for his combative stance in No and his famous lockdown trip to county Durham. The EU is expected to set out plans later today to cut checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain after increased red tape led to disruption for businesses. But European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic has made it clear that the EU would not accept Lord Frostaposs demand for powers of oversight to be stripped from European judges. The Northern Ireland protocol was designed to protect the peace process by preventing a land border on the island of Ireland. Instead, regulatory and customs checks and processes were shted to the Irish Sea. It has caused new economic barriers on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, creating disruption for businesses and tension among unionists.

The Shadow Business Secretary branded Insulate Britain activists’ tactics “counterproductive” and warned they risked “alienating” the public.Speaking at a Green Alliance think-tank event, the former Labour leader told the Mirror: “I think it’s deeply counterproductive, some of what has been happening, I really do.“Part of the task of peaceful protest is to win people to your cause, not alienate them.”He compared Insulate Britain’s methods of bringing traffic to a halt on the London orbital motorway with the  school strikes waged by Swedish teen eco-warrior Greta Thunberg and her supporters.“One of the points I would make is the comparison with the pupil climate strikers,” he said.  “Some people will have said, ‘Should they really be off school Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter“But it pricked people’s consciences, it drew attention to the issue, it super-powered government action, but it didn’t alienate huge swathes of people - and that is my real worry, honestly, about what Insulate Britain have been doing.”He was speaking hours after motorists and Insulate Britain activists clashed in Essex.A mother berated protesters for stopping her from driving her -year-old son to school. Lorry drivers blasted their horns and a female protester was nearly run over by a frustrated motorist as the environmental campaign group blocked roads for a th time.  Multiple confrontations occurred at around .am, with demonstrators dragged off the roads by drivers near a busy industrial estate in Thurrock. Insulate Britain, an offshoot of environmental campaign group Extinction Rebellion, has now staged protests  times in recent weeks. The group has blocked parts of major roads around London, including the M and M, to draw attention to climate change. Mr Miliband said the “whole agenda of retrofit and insulation is a very important agenda” - and committed to Labour to borrowing money to make homes more environmentally-friendly. “We have said we will borrow to invest,” he said. Speaking before next month’s COP climate change summit in Glasgow, he warned the world would be watching Boris Johnson for leadership as top politicians descended on Scotland.Calling on the Tory chief to have a “laser focus” on the talks, Mr Miliband added: “The role of a Prime Minister is really crucial in this - it is on him. “It’s his reputation on the line, as well as the fate of all of us.” Mr Miliband also urged the Government to issue banks with a deadline for setting out how they will help limit global temperature rises to . degree celsius. Government should ask all financial institutions not just to report on climate risks, as they plan to, but to bring forward by  credible transition plans that are consistent with a . degree pathway,” said Mr Miliband.  “This would make a profound dference in the flow of finance out of fossil fuels and into green energy. We should ask all our FTSE  companies to do the same and have their own climate transition plans, consistent with . degrees, by  - and furthermore, we should be asking in Glasgow that all major economies follow suit. Mr Miliband also left the door open to slapping a windfall tax on energy firms, saying: “All options should be looked at during this period.” It came as the PM’s COP spokeswoman Allegra Stratton told the Institute for Government think-tank the success of the climate summit would be judged on getting to the end and feeling that . has been kept alive.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Ed MilibandBoris JohnsonClimate changePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates from our environment editor on green issues and actions you can takeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Government vowed to issue , temporary visas to HGV drivers and another , to poultry workers in the run up to the festive period to prevent Christmas misery for families. But top Tory Oliver Dowden admitted only  visas had actually been issued and there had been just  applicants. MPs were told last night that the application process takes a minimum of three weeks - meaning drivers applying now are being drafted in for only two months. Retailers have been warning of higher prices and Christmas shortages amid ongoing supply issues, partly caused by an acute shortage of HGV drivers, as well as pandemic restrictions and poor weather.  The UK is also experiencing delays in ports, including Felixstowe where container ships have experienced congestion. Tory chairman Mr Dowden said the number of foreign drivers coming forward to get temporary visas was relatively limited. He told LBC: We have  people that have applied for these visas.I believe the number is just over  that actually received them, so are on the road, but I expect that number to increase over time. Meanwhile, Home Office minister Kevin Foster told MPs that applications for HGV food drivers and poultry workers will be processed in a minimum of  working days - or three weeks. This means that poultry workers who can only stay until  December will only be able to stay in the country for around two months.Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael said: It is shocking that while supermarket shelves are going empty and our ports are gridlocked, visa applications are still taking three weeks or more to be processed. “It means some workers will only be allowed in the country for as little as two months by the time their application has been approved. It’s little wonder so few people are taking up the offer to work here under the Conservatives’ botched visa scheme.“Ministers must end this farce, speed up visa applications and put in place a fair immigration system that enables businesses to recruit the skilled workers they need. Otherwise, Boris Johnsonaposs vow to save Christmas risks joining his ever growing list of broken promises.Chancellor Rishi Sunak tried to reassure people worried about getting their Christmas supplies. Speaking to the BBC in Washington, he said: Weaposre doing absolutely everything we can to mitigate some of these challenges. They are global in nature so we canapost fix every single problem but I feel confident there will be good provision of goods for everybody. Iaposm confident there will be a good amount of Christmas presents available for everyone to buy.

Retired head of the Navy Admiral Lord West told peers the pace of government orders for new warships meant the Senior Service was at risk of dropping below  frigates. The existing fleet of Type , Duke-class vessels - some of which are  years old - is being replaced by eight, Type  City-class Global Combat Ships and five Type , light frigates. But Lord West, who commanded HMS Ardent in the  Falklands War, feared the Navy fleet would dip below  frigates.  He added: “The Government said that we would have and keep a minimum of  frigates - which is, after all, pretty damning for a maritime nation like us.“When one looks at the order rate for frigates, and the possibility of the rolling programme which so many shipyards need, one has to say that we are not going to have  frigates as we move into this decade.”He added: “As someone with an intelligence background, I would think it would be considerably less.”Defence Minister Baroness Goldie did not dispute the warning. But she told peers that “we have for the first time in  years two classes of frigate simultaneously under construction in UK shipyards”.  She added: “The Ministry of Defence expects to place an order for the batch two Type  frigates in the early s and to award a manufacture for the Fleet Solid Support ships within two years from May . “The Defence Secretary has said that he aims to have the National Flagship in the water by  or . “No decisions have yet been taken on order dates ... for the Type  frigates.” Mocking Government pledges of a British shipbuilding revival, Lord West told the Upper House: “It sounds marvellous and indeed having a Prime Minister who says that nothing does more for the security of our nation than building a warship for the Royal Navy obviously cheers a sailor like me up. “But the reality is that  months ago he made these statements and not a single order has been placed since then.”  He said that in  years “on the active list” he was “scarred” by “hearing numerous things about ships coming and never joining the Fleet”.Former Defence Minister Kevan Jones, a Labour MP who sits on the Commons Defence Select Committee and chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Shipbuilding, told the Mirror: “The Government’s schedule to replace a signicant number of Type  frigates by the mid-s looks increasingly unlikely.“As such, the Royal Navy is on track to have its lowest number of frontline warships on record, by the mid-s, chiefly owing to a frigate capability gap which is all the government’s own making.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Royal NavyMinistry of DefenceKevan JonesArmed forcesPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

More families in England turned to schools for support due to pressures linked to the Covid crisis, according to research by UCLaposs Institute of Education. Schools serving populations with high levels of poverty shouldered a higher burden of dealing with food insecurity and inadequate housing. Researchers have warned that pupil premium funding, which is targeted at poorer children, does not cover the work schools do to support children living in poverty. One of the reportaposs authors Prof Alice Bradbury said: Schools are picking up the pieces from a welfare and social services system that no longer provides a real safety net for families.  For those schools, the impacts of poverty on childrenaposs lives are impossible to ignore. They interviewed  parents and staff across seven primary schools in England and found food insecurity was the most pressing priority for them all. Schools went to great s to ensure pupils received at least one meal a day - in some cases distributing food directly to the door. One headteacher said: What weaposve noticed over time was that the people who were coming to our food pantry, and we still run it now, werenapost the free school meal parents. It was this tier just above, the people whoaposd been furloughed, the people who had always had a job. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT school leadersapos union, said: Our members tell us that childrenaposs worries leave them unable to learn and enjoy school and in need of help in the form of food, clothing and basic supplies. They are often embarrassed and ashamed. Itaposs a situation that sticks in the throat of everyone who has young peopleaposs best interests at heart. Poverty and inequality will remain entrenched in the UK unless the Government takes urgent action. Kevin Courtney, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union, said: Schools cannot act alone and urgent action to tackle the scourge of child poverty is needed from the Government.aposWe know that even before coronavirus, . million children and young people were growing up trapped in poverty and this is only going to be made worse as the pandemic continues to take its toll.Covid- has exposed the endemic levels of poverty and inequality in the UK. A Government spokeswoman said: Throughout the pandemic we ensured schools supported the most disadvantaged children by staying open to vulnerable pupils, and delivering free school meals to those learning remotely. We have also increased pupil premium funding, expanded the holiday activities and food programme, and extended breakfast clubs, in addition to our investment of more than £ billion to make up for time lost in the classroom. But we know families have struggled, which is why we have provided billions in welfare support for the most vulnerable, made the largest investment in affordable housing in a decade and expanded mental health services to thousands more children and young people, including through our Mental Health Recovery Action Plan.

NEDs are supposed to be independent officials who “oversee performance and delivery” in a government department.Ben Goldsmith was made a NED at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairsby then Environment Secretary Michael Gove in .But he failed to give up the job, which pays £, for  days work a year, when his brother Zac was made a DEFRA minister by Boris Johnson the following year. “Under the Tories the doors of government departments have been wide open to dodgy lobbyists, Tory donors and friends of Ministers,” Ms Rayner said.  “The role of Non-Executive Director is being routinely abused by Conservative Ministers to hand out jobs to their mates, who are £, a day of taxpayersapos money to apparently scrutinise their chums who gave them the cushy gig in the first place. Zac was allowed to keep the job despite being voted out as MP for Richmond Park in the  election, after the PM made him a Lord. DEFRA does not believe there is a conflict of interest in Ben Goldsmith’s role.People are not barred from NED roles because of political activity, as long as it is declared.There’s no suggestion either Ben or Lord Goldsmith have broken any rules.The Mirror revealed this week that Mr Johnson was soaking up the sun at a luxury Marbella hideaway owned by Lord Goldsmith, as the UK remained in the grip of a cost of living crisis.  Ms Rayner added: After the scandal of his last luxury getaway and the dodgy funding for his Downing Street flat refurbishment, the Prime Minister should simply tell us who is paying for his holiday. “The rules are clear - but Boris Johnson has a habit of breaking them. “If he is getting another freebie then the public have a right to know who is paying, how much theyaposre paying and what theyaposre getting in .

With the spider mating season here, the creepy crawlies will leave their webs and venture indoors to find a partner. And hereaposs a fact to make your skin crawl: there are over  dferent species of spiders in the UK - and all of them bite. But, luckily for us, only  of these species have enough venom that can cause harm to a human. Weaposve put together a list of  of the most common spiders youaposre likely to find around the house in the coming months, and most importantly - whether theyaposll cause you any danger. So keep your eyes peeled and a glass at the ready as you find out which spiders are friends are which are definitely foe. . Missing sector orb web spider  Also known as Zygiella x-notata, this spider is named because it spins an orb web with one full sector missing. With a size of up to mm, this arachnid is relatively small and is common around Britainaposs houses and gardens. The spider, which is not harmful to humans, can be distinguished by its pale body and legs, with silvery-grey markings on its abdomen. Usually seen indoors in the autumn and winter months, this spider prefers warmth and is most common in areas around Leicestershire and Rutland. How big are they  Up to mm Are they harmful  No, not at all . Giant house spider  Measuring a size of mm, this critter is most common in the autumn months when the males leave their webs in search of females. Often the spider youaposre likely to find in the bath, they can run extremely fast, but only for a limitedof time before they have to stop to recover from their exhaustion. These large spiders build sheet like webs and may be found in garages, sheds, attics and cavity walls where they are less likely to be disturbed. Giant house spiders do possess a potent venom and can bite, but they do not usually pose a threat to humans. How big are they  Big - mm Are they harmful  Potentially, yes - but theyaposre not at all aggressive . Daddy long legs spider  Unlike the hairy giant house spiders, these creepy crawlies have small grey bodies and long, thin legs. Although they can y in size, the Pholcus phalangioidescan potentially measure up to mm. Urban myths exist that suggest the daddy long legs spider contains the most potent venom but that their fangs arenapost strong enough to penetrate human skin. Reports on research into this theory suggests that the spiders can bite - but the venom will only deliver a brief mild burning sensation -anything at all. How big are they  Up to mm Are they harmful  No, not really . Lace web spider  Usually found on outdoor walls and fencing, these spiders will retreat inside in the autumn months to find a mate. Heavy rainfall can also force these spiders into the house, usually because they have been flooded out of their own home. They generally grow to a size of around mm and are brown with yellow markings on the abdomen. Be on your guard when you see one of these spiders, as they have been known to bite people in recent years. Bites are reported to be painful but the symptoms usually just consist of localised swelling for around  hours. How big are they  mm Are they harmful  Yes -they bite, youaposll know about it . Zebra jumping spider  These eight-legged creatures are small, reaching a size of just mm. Recognisable from their distinctive white and black markings, the move in a jerky aposstop, startapos motion. These spiders are usually seen from spring through to autumn and can be found on external walls, as well as indoors where they will enter through open doors and windows. They are more likely to flee from humans than attack them, but they can bite - although the venom is not considered medically threatening. How big are they  Small - just mm Are they harmful  No . False widow spider  Cited as Britainaposs most venomous spider the  widow already has a bad reputation. The species, also known as Steatoda nobilis, usually has an overall size of mm and is characterised by a dark brown colour and a bulbous abdomen. Adult female  widow spiders are known to have bitten humans, although they are not usually aggressive and attacks on people are rare and there are no reported UK deaths. Symptoms of a bite can range from a numb sensation to severe swelling and discomfort. In serious cases there can be ious levels of burning or chest pains, which will depend on the amount of venom injected. How big are they  mm Are they harmful  In a word, yes . Cardinal spider  The cardinal spider is the largest spider in the UK, growing to an overallof cm in some cases. Also known as Tegenaria parietina, it is known as the cardinal spider in Britain because of the legend that Cardinal Thomas Woolsey was terried by this species at Hampton Court back in the th century. Although they are mainly thought to be harmless to humans, these arachnids get a bad reputation because of their huge size, incredible speed and their nocturnal habits. Bites from these spiders are rare, and painless. How big are they  Very - cm Are they harmful  No, they look much scarier than they actually areRead more. Money spider  From the Britainaposs biggest to the smallest, money spiders grow no more than mm long, with their leg span just mm. They get their name from an old superstition thatone got stuck in your hair, it would bring you good luck and increased wealth. The money spider weaves hammock shaped webs and bites its prey to paralyse it - before wrapping it in silk and eating it. The fangs on this spider are not anywhere near big enough to penetrate human skin. How big are they  Tiny - mm Are they harmful  No, not at all . Tube web spider  As you might expect, this spider is aptly named because of the tube-shaped web it spins to catch its prey. They are often found in cracks in buildings which they will cover with silk lines while they wait in the entrance.  Originally a species from the Mediterranean regions, it can now be found in British towns including Bristol, Cornwall, Gloucester, Dover, Southampton and Sheffield, amongst others. This spider does bite and the pain has been compared to a deep injection with the sensation lasting for several hours. Despite this, the bites do not appear to have any lasting effects. How big are they  Up to mm Are they harmful  Kind of - their bite might hurt, but the pain wonapost last . Cupboard spiders  Closely related to the  black widow, the Steatoda grossa is often mistaken because of its dark colour and similarly bulbous abdomen. It usually grows to approximately mm inand its appearance can y slightly from purple to brown to black. The female can lay egg sacs at least three times a year which typically contain between  -  eggs. They have been known to bite humans, but are not usually agressive.

The abandoned three-bedroom semi-detached home in Stafford has become overgrown with shrubbery and weeds after its owner died  years ago and now it will go on the market for less than £,.After a wave of complaints from neighbours about its crumbling condition, the property in Tixall Road, Stafford, will go under the hammer with a reserved price of £,, reported StokeonTrentLive.The property auction is set to take place in November and a condition of the sale will be that the buyer brings it back into use within a set time-frame. Council officials tried to track down a next of kin after the previous owner died but without success.  Stafford Borough Council applied to the secretary of state for Communities and Local Government for consent to make a Compulsory Purchase Order– which allows the local authority to take control of the house. Cabinet member for Communities and Health, Councillor Jeremy Pert, said getting the CPO was the last resort. He said: In the first instance we look to work with owners of empty or run-down properties to help bring them back in to use - and last year we assisted more than  homeowners to successfully do this. Empty properties are a wasted resource which can quickly become a blight to the community – but we have a range of measures where we can help the owner, or their next of kin, make their property habitable. Obtaining a CPO is always a last resort as it can be a y legal process which is why we would much rather work with people to remedy the situation in other ways.” He added: This has been an exceptional case in which we have gone to extraordinary s to ensure we can get this property back on the market and I am sure with the right investment and works it will make someone a nice home in the future.

Richard, , and Danielle, , who wanted to be known only by their first names, were told their son had to be delivered eight weeks early to save his le. They said their babyaposs heart rate was dropping after Danielle went to hospital with stomach pains. Medics discovered she had a suspected ruptured placenta and needed an emergency caesarean so baby Owen was just lb oz when he was born - the weight of a pineapple.Richard, from Wallasey, Wirral, told the Liverpool Echo : Danielle had started having pains and we went straight to hospital.  They told her they thought it was a suspected ruptured placenta - which is what it turned out to be - and Owenaposs heart rate was right down. She had emergency surgery to get him out. It was terrying, completely heartbreaking. We were toldwe had left it another hour, he wouldnapost have made it because his heart rate was so low. Tiny Owen was just lb oz - the weight of a pineapple - when he was born on October , but his dad said he is going from strength to strength.  Richard, who is also dad to Cain, , Lewis,  and stepdad to Jack, seven, said: When he was born we heard him cry like a kitten and then he was given straight to Danielle and then I held him for a bit. He was then taken to intensive care and we didnapost see him for a few hours. We had joked about having to get everything ready for when he was born just a few nights before, and now here he is. But he is doing really well, he was bigger than they expected and he is already off his oxygen and is now taking full feeds.  We canapost thank all the staff at Arrowe Park enough, they saved his le and made everything so much easier for us. Owen has not yet met his brothers and sisters due to Covid restrictions on the hospital wards at Arrowe Park. Richard said: They are made up and they canapost wait to meet him. We expect he will have to stay in until his due date in December, but he has been doing so well, he might be able to come home a little sooner. He added: We called him Owen and didnapost realise at the time it means aposyoung warriorapos, which is exactly what he is.

The rapid Covid tests, which give users a response in less than  minutes, have previously been criticised in comparison to PCR tests, where results are sent to a lab to be checked. Government guidance currently suggests that anyone with a positive LFT should follow it up with a PCR test to confirm they have the virus. But researchers from University College London have now found LFTs are more than % effective at detecting any level of Covid infection. They are also likely more than % effective at detecting those who are most infectious, they added.  A person might show up as negative on a LFT but positive on a PCR testthey are not a peak transmissible stage, the scientists said. They noted that the two testing methods should not be compared, as they work in dferent ways - with LFTs likely to give a positive result when someone is infectious. PCR tests instead detect genetic material which can be present in the body weeks after the person is infectious. Professor Michael Mina, from the Hard School of Public Health, said LFTs could catch nearly everyone with Covid when they are at their most infectious. He said: There is a spectrum of infectious amounts of the COVID- virus and we show that LFTs are likely to detect cases -% of the time when people are at their most infectious. The tests could achieve even % sensitivity when viral loads are at their peak and therefore catch nearly everyone who is currently a serious risk to public health. It is most likely thatsomeoneaposs LFT is negative but their PCR is positive then this is because they are not at peak transmissible stage. The study concluded that LFTs are a reliable tool in preventing the spread of Covid.  Everyone currently has free access to LFTs, with the tests being used widely to allow entry into schools, offices and work places. Prof Irene Petersen, the lead study author, urged people to trust them and stay at homethey get a positive result. She said: Previous studies comparing the reliability of lateral flow tests and PCR tests could be potentially misleading because a PCR test is a marker of having been infected at some point within a certain window of time and does not necessarily mean someone is infectious when testing positive.

Using an app, the owner can watch visitors through the camera and talk to them via the doorbellaposs microphone.Mr Woodard - who works as an audio-visual technician - says he fitted four cameras around his property, MailOnline reports. Two of the devices were dummies and he used them to deter car thieves after an attempted theft in , he said. Dr Fairhurst - who is the director of a holistic healthcare company - told Oxford County Court she considered the devices continuous visual surveillance. More than , people in the UK own a Ring doorbell, meaning the ruling yesterday could pave the way for similar cases across the country. The neighbours were peaceful until recently when the doctor claims Mr Woodard became aggressive when she told him she was unhappy about the doorbell, Oxford County Court heard. Judge Melissa Clarke told the court yesterday Mr Woodard had breached the Data Protection Act  and UK GDPR laws. The ruling now entitles Dr Fairhurst to compensation and Mr Woodard is banned from recording her with his surveillance cameras. Any images or audio files of Dr Fairhurst stored on the devices are now considered her personal data. The judge also found that Mr Woodard - considered a data controller by the Information Commissioner - failed to store Dr Fairhurstaposs data in a fair or transparent way. He had also sought to actively mislead Dr Fairhurst about the way the cameras worked and what data they captured. Judge Clarke said Mr Woodard had collected the doctoraposs personal data by recording her beyond the boundaries of his property.  Another camera was installed in Mr Woodardaposs driveway - which he claimed was a dummy. The judge disagreed and said this camera captured images and audio on Dr Fairhurstaposs property including her gate, garden and car parking spaces. She also said crime prevention was achievable with something less than the Ring device. Judge Clarke added the cameraaposs audio range canapost be considered reasonable for crime prevention. Mr Woodard told the Mail after the remote hearing he was extremely disappointed and shocked by the ruling. He told the Mail: I purchased a ring doorbell and ring motion activated camera in , in good faith to protect my property and vehicles. To now be told these are harassment devices feels like a joke and I myself feel like I am being harassed. Many of my neighbours have cameras and smart doorbells.  He added the ruling contradicts police advice. Forces up and down the country are known to appeal for the public to hand over smart doorbell, CCTV and dashcam footage to help bolster evidence to assist arrests for thieves, dangerous drivers, and violent criminals. Mr Woodard also said he worries that tens of thousands of homeowners with similar devices may now be targeted in the same way. Amazon-owned Ring has now asked its customers to make visitors aware they are being recorded in response to the landmark ruling. A spokesperson for the Calornia-based company told The Mail: We strongly encourage our customers to respect their neighboursapos privacy and comply with any applicable laws when using their Ring device. Weaposve put features in place across all our devices to ensure privacy, security, and user control remain front and centre - including customisable Privacy Zones to block out aposoff-limitapos areas, Motion Zones to control the areas customers want their Ring device to detect motion and Audio Toggle to turn audio on and off. Damages payable to Dr Fairhurt are expected to be revealed during a November court date, but she could be awarded £,. The ruling means that anyone with the same Ring doorbell who is accused of filming people outside their property could be subject of a similar lawsuit over breaching the privacy of their neighbours.

Dr Tijion Esho has been the voted the UK’s best aesthetics doctor every year since  and was this year named most influential doctor in the beauty industry. With the rich and famous flocking to his clinic for treatments like his -ct gold champagne facial, he is known to many as the A-list’s best kept secret. But while he helps many feel confident in their own skin, Dr Tijon - whose popular ESHO brand has made facials available to everyone - often felt out of place as he pursued his career in the cosmetics industry.  At medical school he was one of only two black students in his year: “I remember a girl coming up to me and she was just staring at me and she said, ‘I know this really sounds weird, but you’re the first black person I’ve seen in real le and not on TV’. “I just thought that was weird, what world am I coming into  Coming from a erse community to here where people were so limited. Also at the time. I was worried in terms of classism because a lot of people there were from generations of doctors. I was like, am I on the back foot here  “In the end what showed through was talent. When you’re working through, you gain respect and you move through and you blaze your own path through things.” Growing up in North London’s Edmonton, he knows all too well the importance of having positive role models and exposure to dferent career paths. His parents emigrated from Nigeria and they were made to sacrice their own dreams in order to earn enough money to support their children.  “My parents came here in their s from Nigeria and they had me and then had my sister. They were educated people, my Dad was an accountant and my Mum was a teacher but when they came over here their qualications weren’t recognised and they worked in a tiling factory. We lived in council state housing. They did a lot of sacricing to put me and my sister through education. “My Dad always said, ‘you have opportunities here son, you have to grab it with both hands’, and so I’ve never wanted to sit on my hands. I’ve always wanted to push to do as much as I can because then I feel like I’m paying back my parents for the opportunities and the sacrices they made for us.” Initially wanting to pursue a career in graphic design, Tijion’s plans were challenged by his Dad who wanted his son to chase something in STEM.The UK began celebrating Black History Month, an idea first spawned in the United States and then also adopted by European countries including Ireland and the Netherlands, in October . Black History Month helps give context to modern le and the countryaposs history, while championing the experiences and celebrating the contributions of Black Britons here in the UK. The observation was first organised through the leadership of Ghanaian-born analyst Akyaaba Addai-Sebo. He served as a coordinator of special projects for the Greater London Council. Consequently, Akyaaba created a plan aiming to recognise the contributions of African, Asian and Caribbean people to the economic, cultural and political le in the UK. “My dad was said you can pick between being a doctor, a dentist, a lawyer, engineer or an accountant. These are careers where you’ll have security in the future’. “We didn’t see eye to eye at that point because I couldn’t understand why he would push me from something that I loved to these things that I knew nothing about. In retrospect as an adult looking at it, I can see he was seeing the sacrices he had to make, and was trying to get me in a position to be secure enough to provide for a family. “When I went on work experience, I saw the art in what the surgeon was doing on people’s faces and bodies. I saw it and I was amazed and I thought okay, we have a compromise here. Plastics became my thing because I loved the art, I loved the finesse and the attention to detail.” Turning down a private school scholarship in favour of going to the local state school with his friends, Tijion says his Dad pushed him and enabled him to get the million pound career that he has today. “If it wasn’t for my parents, medical school might not have happened because at school I was discouraged, I actually wasn’t pushed. I remember meeting the head of the year when my dad and I said medicine was the way to go and her saying, ‘Have you got any alternatives, because that might be a bit dficult’. There wasn’t a push to it or a ‘let’s give you access to it.’ It was a no. My dad was hyper aware that for a lot of young black guys, the push was towards sports.” Now the doctor wants to build a laboratory for his products in the UK that will offer black students career inspiration and opportunities in both medicine and pharmaceutical fields.  “I’m not just doing this for my family or me, I’m doing this on a community level now and I need to try and do my best to give opportunities to people like me to have access.” The drive to inspire can be heavy though with an emphasis on perfection, precision and appearances - much like cosmetic surgery itself. “If there’s a mistake, you’re no longer the UK’s leading cosmetic surgeon, you are the Nigerian doctor. I think every black parent tells you that you’re going to be scrutinised dferently. You are going to be judged dferently, you have to work hard and we know that early. We’re told that so early.” Social media trolls come with the territory too with Tijion receiving abuse aimed at himself, his son Roman, , and his partner Laura.  “When people saw that my partner was white and my son was mixed race, some people took that as a negative thing. “When my son was born, I got these inboxes from unnamed accounts and they said, ‘Your kid, even though he’s half white, he could never not be black, he’s still a monkey.’ “I built a thick skin for things coming towards me but for stuff to come towards my missus and my baby  That really affected me because all you want to do is protect them and for people to love them.” Comment MORE ON EducationSchoolsCosmetic surgeryPlastic surgeryFacialsBlack History Month\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Just be sure to put the lid down before you flush - to avoid contaminating the entire bathroom.Kitchen surfaces: Every time you use themCleaning your kitchen surface as you go will help to reduce a huge workload in the long run. Spray with disinfectant to kill any nasty bacteria, both before and after preparing a meal.Carpet:  to  times a week Everyone loves the warmth and comfort of a carpet, but you must remember that they harbour a lot of bacteria. Not only that - they are often home to other nasties such as dust mites which can cause asthma. Vacuum regularly and to take off your outdoor shoes before walking on your carpet.Bedding: Once a week Paul recommends that you wash your bedding above  degrees to kill any bacteria. Unless you sweat a lot at night or enjoy sleeping in the nude, once a week at  degrees is appropriate - and isn’t too time-consuming. To lessen the need to change your sheets as often, a mattress protector is advised.Sinks: Daily when usedAgain, a quick clean of your ceramic sink is a good way to chip away at chores throughout the week. The plug area can be an unseen danger and hotspot for bacteria and dirt: one that can be easily combated with permanent antimicrobial protection.Remote control and light switches: Once a weekBoth light switches and TV remote controls are amongst the filthiest surfaces in the average household.

It seemed to be old, and the message inside appeared to have been written by a child. The message inside was from somebody called Alex,who gave an address of  Gilbert Street, Hindley.

Clare Pert and her friends had arranged to put together the calendar to raise money for a local hospice and the mum bravely modelled for her month of April, with only a yellow duck teddy protecting her modesty. But when the group later sat down to review their creation together, it quickly dawned on Clare as they looked through January, February and Marchaposs photos that she had screwed up massively. The business analyst from Leeds had assumed it was a naked calendar after it was mentioned briefly in passing, but the rest of her friends posed fully clothed or in swimsuits, and they now jokingly warn Clare not to turn up starkers every time they make plans.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Clare was recently reminded of the embarrassing incident, which took place back in , when it came up as a Facebook memory and she decided to embrace her initial embarrassment by sharing the story in a viral post. The mum to three boys, who blames the misunderstanding on baby brain having been -weeks pregnant at the time, said: I’d never done a naked photoshoot before. And, come to think of it, I now know none of my friends have either. I chose to be April as that was when my son was due. My turn came, and I went into the photographer, took all my clothes off and proudly announced: aposWhere do you want me !apos I couldnapost understand why the photographer and his we were so shocked - but I put it down to me being the only pregnant lady maybe. They had just seen January, February and Marchaposs lady gardens, so why was I any dferent   Roll forward a week, I sit down with my  other friends, all looking through the pictures. January, February and March came, by then I knew I had screwed up massively - they all had either clothes or swimwear on. I was mortied seeing myself absolutely starkers, with just a massive yellow chick covering my bits, I will never live that down. Clare turned up late to the photoshoot and being in a rush, she says she didnapost think to checkanyone  was getting their kit off and hurriedly stripped off and headed into the studio. Itaposs a mistake the mum has never been allowed to forget as it still remains her friendsapos favourite topic of conversation.  The mishap recently popped back up on Facebook as a memory and - after a couple of glasses of wine - Clare decided it was the right time to give everyone  a laugh.The post has since gone viral with more than , likes and , comments, as other people replied with their own embarrassing moments in a show of support. Clare added: I literally just spent all day reading through the comments and the funny stories and the messages. I didn’t see one negative message and everyone was so nice - I shared it because it was such a stupid thing to do, and it took off!Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Viral\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Duke went on to discuss his worries about his son’s generation who might still be talking about climate change in  years’ time, when it will be too late As part of a new BBC podcast, William said: So George at school recently has been doing litter picking and I didnapost realise but talking to him the other day he was already showing that he was getting a bit confused and a bit sort of annoyed by the fact they went out litter picking one day and then the very next day they did the same route, same time and pretty much all the same litter they picked up back again. And I think that for him he was trying to understand how and where it all came from. He couldnapost understand, heaposs like, aposwell, we cleaned this. Why has it not gone away ’ The future king told the podcast that he was concerned that George and his generation might still be talking about climate change in decades to come.  He added: But it shouldnapost be that thereaposs a third generation now coming along having to ramp it up even more. And you know, for me, it would be an absolute disasterGeorge is sat here talking to you or your successor, you know in like  years’ time, whatever, still saying the same thing, because by then we will be too late.William also slammed billionaire space tourists such as Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk for pursuing space travel instead of helping to solve the climate crisis.In an impassioned plea to two of the world’s richest men, both worth around £billion each, the Duke of Cambridge said: “We need some of the world’s greatest brains and minds fixed on trying to repair this planet, not trying to find the next place to go and live.” A new age space race between Amazon founder Bezos’s Blue Origin and Tesla founder Musk has emerged pitting two of the world’s richest and brainiest men against each other. In contrast, father-of-three William has said he is being motivated with his environmental work to “use my little bit of influence” to help change the world for future generations. “I want the things that I’ve enjoyed – the outdoor le, nature, the environment – I want that to be there for my children, and not just my children but everyone ’s children. “If we’re not careful we’re robbing from our children’s future through what we do now. And I think that’s not fair. I want to use my little bit of influence   profile to highlight incredible people doing incredible things and will genuinely help fix some of these problems.” His comments, which will be broadcast today in an interview on the BBC Newscast podcast, come as Hollywood actor William Shatner yesterday became the oldest person to go to space.The -year-old, who played Captain James T Kirk in the Star Trek films and TV series, took off from the Texas desert with three other iniduals in a mission paid for by Bezos. Mr Shatneraposs trip on the rocket lasted about  minutes, while in July Bezos made his own  minute flight into space in his self funded rocket New Shepard saying it was his “best day ever!

Her Majesty was visiting the Welsh Parliament in Cardf with her son Charles, the Prince of Wales, and his we Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall. She wore a pink coat and hat combination and was not sporting a mask as she shook hands with dignitaries. Clasped in her hand was a walking stick she was last seen holding two days ago at a service to mark the th anniversary of the Royal British Legion. Before that the Queen, , was last spotted in public using the same walking aid back in January , when she relied on it to assist her walking following a knee operation. On Tuesday Her Majesty was handed the stick after stepping from her state limousine, and appeared to be moving freely as she walked to her seat for the start of the service. She used the stick again as she left. A jam-packed schedule was put on for the Queen, Charles and Camilla at the Parliament building, which is called Senedd Cymru in Welsh.  The Welsh and British national anthems were played to welcome the royals before a royal salute was given. The Royal Navy with the band of the Royal Marines was in position in front of the Senedd. Also greeting the trio were school children waving Welsh flags. The royals were due to meet party leaders and listen to a musical performance given by the Welsh National Youth Opera. The Queen, Charles and Camilla were there for the opening ceremony of the sixth session of the Senedd. Back in  the head of state was seen using a walking stick as she left King Edward VII Hospital in London.  Back then she opted for a heavy duty pole following the operation, before wielding a wooden support two weeks later at Sandringham. Paul Simons, the owner of London-based business WalkingSticks, told Mail Online that the Queen was using a more of a telescopic walking pole with trigger grip and wrist loop this week. He added: It has an unusual grip but appears to be a comfortable companion and the Queenaposs go-to walking stick for occasions such as this.

Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, six, collapsed with fatal injuries at a home after he was forced to spend marathon stints in front of the front door, Coventry Crown Court heard. It was also claimed little Arthur was made to sleep on the floor in the living room despite the fact there were empty beds upstairs. Prosecutors say it was part of a campaign of cruelty he was allegedly subjected to before being unlawfully killed. Arthuraposs father Thomas Hughes, , and his partner Emma Tustin, , deny murder and multiple counts of child cruelty. Tustin has admitted one child cruelty offence.  During the fourth day of the trial on Tuesday, prosecutor Jonas Hankin alleged the couple assaulted Arthur, isolated him from the family, forced him to stand up for prolonged periods of time, denied him food and drink as well as poisoned him with salt. Mr Hankin told the jury about the events leading up to Arthuraposs collapse on June  last year. On June , Arthur spent a total of  hours and  minutes in the hallway, the court heard. CCTV of Tustin eating a McDonaldaposs in the living room was shown to the court as Arthur ate lunch a few feet away in the hall.  At one point, Tustin allegedly sent Hughes an audio clip of him crying along with a text message reading: P***ed me off he has. Paused Corrie. Hughes allegedly replied: Kid is a selfish little c*** Iaposll dash my food off his head. Arthur then spent a further  hours and  minutes in the hallway on June , the court heard. The jury watched CCTV from the home of the couple eating ice cream cones as well as sitting in the hot tub.  Earlier that day, Tustin allegedly texted Hughes accusing Arthur of making my le hell and claiming she was slowly but surely cracking. By the afternoon, it appeared Hughes was trying to seduce Tustin to the bedroom by messaging her saying he was naked and waiting for you to take my soul. Mr Hankin then read a text message to the court from June  that was sent from Tustin to Hughes, which said: Still screaming. He said he hates me. Heaposs gonna spit his sandwich out on the floor when he has it. Loves his nan more than you.  Heaposs just said he donapost f***ing care now saying haha because I said Iaposm telling you. He said you wonapost believe me, you will believe him like before. Now screamed heaposs gonna tell his mom to kill me. Just on the phone to Affy. He said: aposGlad we arenapost going because I was going to be naughty all day for you. Mr Hankin told the court Tustin was the only possible perpetrator behind the alleged fatal assault on Arthur on June  because she was the only one at home looking after him. He argued Hughes shares culpability because he intentionally encouraged the killing.

Social media is seeing users increasingly talking about having caught a “Super Cold” as Covid- tests come back negative. Prof Neil Mabbott, expert at the University of Edinburgh, said: “This highlights the power of the lockdown, mask wearing, social distancing and sanitation measures introduced in response to the pandemic.“Not only was this very effective in reducing transmission of the coronavirus within the community, but at the same time it had the additional benefit of reducing the spread of colds and other common transmissible diseases.“As these measures are eased and people start mixing more indoors and travelling on public transport we can expect to see a signicant rise in colds and other respiratory diseases.”  Retail worker Rebecca London, , from Bournemouth, caught what she calls “the worst cold ever” at a festival.A normal cold for her would have “a runny nose, sneezing, a bit of a sore throat and feeling a bit rundown”.“Nothing like this,” she told the BBC. “I barely slept, I’d wake up in the night just coughing, a constantly runny nose and feeling so tired,” she adds. Rebecca did lateral flow tests and got negative results, but has been ill for more than a week, and was left wondering “ it’s ever going to end”.  Prof Alex Richter, of Birmingham University, said: “It is impossible to tell the dference between a cold and Covid- clinically. “They present so similarly that only PCR testing can dferentiate between the two. Lateral flow testing can help with screening, butsomeone has symptoms then they should go for a PCR swab test.” “It is unlikely we are seeing the circulation of a aposSuper Coldapos,” Prof Mabbott added. “Rather our immune systems have had limited exposure to colds over the past  months, so our immunity to these diseases will have waned during this period and will be less effective against colds than would be expected normally.” Prof Alan McNally, is Professor of Microbial Evolutionary Genomics at the University of Birmingham and was Infectious Disease lead at the Milton Keynes Lighthouse Lab. He said: “If you have any symptoms of respiratory infection you should stay at home to prevent transmission and get a test done for Covid- to rule in or out. Trying to self-diagnose is a sure fire way to send Covid- case rates soaring again.” Comment MORE ON EducationHospitalsHeart diseasePublic transportCoronavirusNHS\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Dr John McCauley says spiralling cases in China, India and Croatia could indicate an earlier wave of infections in the UK this year. It comes amid a warning that immunity against bugs is so low after Covid lockdowns that the flu could kill , people. The UKaposs flu season usually begins in September and ends in March but the NHS usually starts to feel the pressure in January. However Dr McCauley - a prominent flu scientist based at Londonaposs Francis Crick Institute - says Brits should prepare for an earlier surge in cases due to a rise in infections overseas. He told MailOnline that Croatia, China and India had all experienced a rise in infections.It’s over the next few weeks that we will be able to tellwhat we are seeing now is sustained. If it is, we might expect an early flu season, he added. There is flu being picked up in some places, but whether it is spreading in some of theseis not known for certain. His warning comes as Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, fears Brits will face a deadly double act of Covid and flu this winter due to waning immunity. Dr Harries said the public should be worried about the flu each winter. Speaking to Trevor Phillips on Sky she warned that those who catch both illnesses at the same time are twice as likely to die than patients with Covid alone. She said: On average over the past five years, around , people have died [per year] with flu-related conditions.  The important thing about this winter is that weaposre likely to see flu, for the first time in any real numbers, co-circulating with Covid. The risks of both together still remain. The early evidence suggests youaposre twice as likely to die from the two together than just Covid alone. Last week Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, Deputy chief medical officer, warned that immunity against bugs is so low after lockdowns that the flu could kill , people. He said: “Not many people got flu last year because of Covid restrictions, so there isn’t as much natural immunity as usual. “We will see flu circulate this winter. It might be higher than usual and that makes it a signicant public health concern. Covid- will still be circulating and with more people mixing indoors, sadly some increases are possible. For the first time we will have Covid- and flu co-circulating. Urging people to get the Covid jab, he added: “We need to take this seriously and defend ourselves and the NHS by getting the annual flu jab and the Covid- booster when called. Both these viruses are serious. They can both spread easily, cause hospitalisation and they can both be fatal. “It is really important that people get their vaccines as soon as they can.” Comment MORE ON NHSFluNorovirusCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It comes on top of residents raising over £, in record time from a community share offer to buy The Old Forge in the Scottish Highlands. The pub can only be reached by boat or walking  miles over several mountains over  feet - from the nearest road. The community of just over  people on the west coast at Knoydart have been so successful with a bold fundraising campaign to purchase the distant drinking hole that it called time on its share offer a week early - by which point they had raised £, from  members! Have your say on this story in the comment section  Now, the locally formed The Old Forge Community Benefit Society, has announced it has been awarded £, through the Scottish Land Fundto support the purchase and redevelopment of the pub, which is listed by the Guinness Book of Records as the remotest on mainland Britain. Belgian owner Jean-Pierre Robinet has put it on the market at offers over £,.  Jacqui Wallace and Rhona Miller, co-chairs of the society’s management committee, said in a statement: “We are delighted that the SLF has chosen to support our community-ownership bid of The Old Forge. This project is of huge importance to Knoydart and we are now in a strong position to make it a reality.” The group’s structure as a community benefit society ensures that locals and supporters will be in control of the pub’s future, and the businesses operations are defined with community benefit at the forefront.  Profits are reinvested back into the business and other local projects, not distributed among shareholder members. Davie Newton, management committee member, said: “The Old Forge is on the market for offers over £,, but that figure does not include the owner’s asking price for goodwill of the business. “We are currently working with the owner to undertake an independent valuation of the goodwill, and once this has taken place, we will be able to assess and submit an appropriate offer. “  Shares started at £ for local residents, with non-resident applications having a higher minimum investment amount of £,. Of the  local residents, over  have offered to volunteer their time to the cause and working groups have been set up for all aspects of the project from business planning and fundraising to post-purchase management plans.

Researchers found that  percent of women have gone to great s throughout their lives to cover up spots, including wearing roll neck jumpers in summer and wrapping scarfs around their face. And over the past  months, more than half of the , women polled have enjoyed covering their faces with masks. Other tricks regularly deployed to hide bad skins include wearing hair loosely, growing a fringe and walking with their head down.  Half have also tried covering acne or spots up with layers of makeup, but fear it just makes things worse. Did you enjoy wearing a mask  Have your say in the comment section  Nearly three-quartersof women arenapost happy with their skin and have tried six products to attempt to fix it. And the average woman spends  minutes caring for her skin each day, spending an average of £ in the last year. The survey was commissioned by Polish dermacosmetics skincare brand Tolpa, which has launched its facial skincare products in the UK.  Kadeeja Sel Khan, an ambassador for Tolpa’s Nothing to Hide campaign, said: “It’s hard to see so many women struggle with the look of their skin, even when it’s such a natural and normal thing that we all go through.“I have acne-prone and very sensitive skin and it can definitely get my mood down sometimes. “Like many women, I used to find myself trying to hide my skin – but I have embraced the natural look and began using products that show the reality behind the filter, that actually work, which has made a huge dference.”  The survey also found  percent of women consider their skin to be the most important part of their appearance. Concerningly,  percent said there has been a time when they haven’t left their house because of their skin, and one in ten have even lost out on opportunities because of their spots. Furthermore,  percent have turned to home-made remedies including putting toothpaste on a spot, and honey face masks and apple cider vinegar in a bid to clear their skin.

For humans, fear is something that we can describe to each other through stories about our experiences and one such scenario is that of the good old ghost story. These stories are recounted within every culture on earth and y descriptively on what you would have seen or encountered in accordance to your belief system.  At Spectrum Paranormal Investigations there are a set of protocols in place - things it requires from all clientele - before it takes on a case. Here the team shares the advice it gives to anybody who believes they have seen a ghost. Think your home is haunted  Share your own experiences in the comments below too. Step-by-step guide Firstly you have to take into account all factors surrounding your experience, these can range from your state of mind at that present time, to are you familiar with the location or has this experience taken place somewhere that you already believe to be haunted  Initial SightingTry to remember as much detail as possible, even though it may have been a terrying experience. This will help determine what type of encounter you may have had. Obtaining EvidenceIf you are still in the location and haven’t run for the hills! Then we would ask that as much evidence you could obtain would help. This could range from taking pictures to recording sounds of the environment.Helpful Equipment Within the field of paranormal investigating the EMFmeter is one such device used to detect changes to the environment looking for spikes at certain points when normally it would be dficult to obtain a reading these spikes are measured in milligauss, a unit of measurement of the magnetic-field and is also believed to be the field in which spirit energy moves around in. It is important to note that you are surrounded by magnetic fields, this radiates from the Earth’s core and envelops the Planet, also known as the Torus Energy Field!Seeking HelpThis could be a matter for your local spiritual leader or your local paranormal team. Do not in anyway try to make contact with the entity! Doing this could be disastrousthe spirit is malevolent. Read moreSafe PracticesWicca seems to be favoured by many as a way to ward off spirits, and the burning of sage and along with prayer is one such practice. The spraying of salt water in the air is used to discharge negative ion energy. Remember that good positive vibes in your home environment can help with creating positively charged energy. This could come in the form of relaxing music and filling your home with love and happiness when possible and not aggression. This will also stop any negative spirit from feeding on your misery.Never Do This You must never try to make direct contact with the spirit using means of communication such as Ouija or Seance unless you are fully trained in these methods. It is also advisable never to be under the influence of any kind of alcohol or drugs whilst trying to perform any of the above as you have to be sound of mind. Otherwise how could anyone take you seriously on this subject  acknowledging the supposed spirit will only give it access into your le. Albeit this could be in your subconscious mind until proven that a spirit is present! This could still have disastrous consequences and disrupt your daily well-being.  What evidence is there of ghosts  Evidence is always the key factor to any sighting. It’s basically detective work you have to rationalise all the factors involved first before jumping to the conclusion that you have seen a spirit. It is recommended you keep a diary of all activity from that moment on. Even though it may seem very insignicant at first, but over a period of four weeks we would normally see a pattern developing. Writing down such things like the times you see objects being moved when you know consciously know where it had previously been placed or evenyou begin to smell uncommon odours, in some cases people say it’s a putrid smell that of rotten eggs. When a loved one has passed away people often report the scent of flowers in the home and the odour of tobacco is reported in many cases. Remember, it’s very normal to feel that you are being watched from beyond the grave as we all have loved ones that have passed away and miss their presence.

There are three main types of damp: condensation damp, rising damp and penetrating damp.Condensation dampCost to repair: £ - £, This is the most common form of damp found in homes, and occurs when hot air hits cold surfaces. To avoid it try to keep your house warm - perhaps put your heating onto a timer setting so it comes on periodically throughout the day. Also make sure to close the door when youaposre showering or cooking as this will avoid the moisture spreading to other rooms. You could also use moisture-resistant or anti-mould paint on areas that are likely to see high levels of moisture. If you are experiencing condensation damp, try to dry the areas as much as possible before wiping any mould with mould cleaner or with soapy water and a cloth not a brush. Then dry the area once again and leave a humidier running for as long as possible.  Rising dampCost to repair: £, - £,Rising damp iscaused by groundwater that moves up through your wall.Most walls have what’s called a ‘damp-proof course’ built into them, which blocks water from moving upwards through them, but rising damp can happenit’s ineffective, orthe course was never fitted to begin with. If you see any of the following signs, a new damp-proof course must be installed in your walls.A line of white salts on your walls Damp only on the lower half of your walls with a ‘tide-line’ above it Fluffy white salt on your walls Peeling paint and wallpaper Brown, crumbling plaster Skirting board damagePenetrating damp Cost to repair: £ - £ per room This occurs when leaks come in from the outside, like from poorly installed windows and doors, roofing issues, blocked gutters and leaking downpipes. To stop penetrating damp, check the following for any cracks, faults or defects and have them fixed:Flashing - this is where your roof meets your chimney Outer walls Your loft Roof Windows and doors - especially their frames Gutters, pipes and general drainage systemYou may also have penetrating dampyou notice any bubbled or wet plaster, which can occur straight after heavy rain or snow, and or cracks in masonry surfaces, renders or mortar joints. How to prevent damp in the bathroom The bathroom is one of the most common places to experience damp, especiallythe ventilation is poor. Boiler Plan has a few tips to keep damp at bay, including: Open a window Turn on an extractor fan Keep surfaces dry Fit air bricks - they have tiny holes in them, and can be fitted to exterior walls to allow air to pass through Use a humidier Use moisture-resistant or anti-mould paint Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Sharing his story anonymously, the man said that he had been with his partner for three years but they lived apart and he had no idea about her unusual hygiene routine. Things reached breaking point for the pair when they moved in together, and the man said that she smelt so bad that he couldnapost sleep in the same bed as her. The man said that he tried to discuss the issue with his girlfriend but she became defensive, saying her shower routine was aposnone of his businessapos. What do you think about the manaposs situation  Let us know in the comments...Taking to Reddit, the man said: I love her, but I did not know what I was getting into. She doesn’t shower frequently. At all. She showers at max once every other week. Before we moved in together I didn’t notice any particular bad smell. Occasionally she had body odour which is human. I’m guessing she would take her occasional shower before seeing me. After a few months of trying to live with it, I was fed up. I had been sleeping on the couch because the smell was so terrible. I sat her down and tried to have a serious conversation about it. When the pair discussed the issue, the woman got angry and then she became upset, and now the pair arenapost seeing eye to eye.

TikTok user @joli.artist has left her followers spooked after a recent video she uploaded titled ‘apocalypse...again’. Often known to discuss macabre stuff, Joli’s content focuses on things like conspiracy theories and quantum physics. In her video, she talks about the ‘quantum immortality theory’ which is American physicist Hugh Everett’s ‘many-worlds’ interpretation. She goes on to explain the theory that states “nobody ever actually dies” and that “consciousness never experiences death.” “Instead, whenever you die in one universe your consciousness just gets transferred into another universe where you survive.” So, for those who may be excited or intrigued about the concept of an apocalypse, sadly,Everett is correct, you’re just going to wake up somewhere . She continued: So after the inevitable apocalypse occurs, youaposre going to wake up the next day in a new reality, and the next thing you know, youaposre going to find yourself on Reddit talking about apossince when did Pizza Hut have two Ts !apos “Arguing with people who are native of this new reality, talking about apositaposs always had two Ts apos This is in reference to the many discussions on internet forums surrounding the Mandela Effect.For those unaware of the phenomenon, itaposs when an inidualbelieve a distorted memory. Common examples are that the Monopoly man wore a monocle or that Curious George had a tail. It is actually called the Mandela Effect because so many people believe Nelson Mandela died in prison in the s when he actually died in . Joli is implying that in our reality, apocalypses happen every day, which left many users feeling uneasy to say the least. She continued: “You don’t believe me  Okay, it’s been about  million years since the asteroids allegedly took out the dinosaurs. “So you mean to tell me that in the last  million years, no other asteroids have come through the neighbourhood and taken us out  What Iaposm saying is that Earth is probably always being taken out, and our consciousness just keeps transferred to another parallel universe - and then another one, and another one. For all you know the apocalypse probably already happened last night... The video so far has got  thousand likes, with plenty of uncomfortable comments. One TikTok user said: “The thought of never being able to actually die is extremely depressing and giving me a headache.” Another user said: “You’re over here talking about extinction level events and I’m having to check on the two Ts in Pizza Hut.” Many users were quick to point out a glitch in the video, and when they watched it a second time, the glitch disappeared.

Snatched from his family in , the poor bottlenose was starved and forced to perform for human crowds - but ran out his final years alone after being deemed too heavy and foolish. When Makaiko finally passed away around  years ago, no one noticed he had got tangled in a net at a dolphinarium and quietly drowned. His former trainer Lorena Kya Lopez recently opened up on his heartbreaking tale in a grim warning about the wildle trade, which subjects millions of wild animals to suffering every day. Ocean turned red as pod hunted down Born in , Makaiko roamed free with other pods, playing in the Pacic Ocean off the coast of Taiji, Japan. One day, however, the sound of motorboats approaching the group left mothers desperately scrambling to gather up their young. Hunters threw down heavy nets, scooping up dolphins to harvest for their meat or to sell into the tourist entertainment industry. While the water turned red from the blood of the dolphins who tried to escape or were killed, Makaiko was lted out of the water, unable to move in the net, Lopez told World Animal Protection.Makaiko had been captured. And so began the rest of his le in captivity. Alongside his sister Kumiko, the young animal was sold to a dolphinarium in Japan. During transportation, he was painfully laid out on a stretcher and sprayed with water to keep his skin from drying out.  It was days before the pair were given any food. When they finally arrived at their temporary home, Makaiko was put in a small tank treated with chemicals to keep it clean. It wasn’t until they went to the surface and people approached them and started throwing dead fish at them that they had a chance to eat, explained Lopez. The dead fish were not as nutritious as the food they would normally get in the ocean, but at that point, it was better than nothing. The meals came with a catch - the trainers would only feed the dolphinsthey obeyed orders to perform tricks. Weak and disorientated, Makaiko learned to jump and pushed trainers around the tank for hours on end. Hauled from venue to venue in pitch black box After  months, the siblings were suddenly moved into a pitch black transportation box. For over two days, they were unable to see anything. Hauled out on to a stretcher, Makaiko was treated with a cream to stop his skin drying again, but he was left in agony - visibly bleeding. Eventually, they landed at the Six Flags dolphin venue in Mexico, where Lopez first came across the distressed creatures. Here, trainers continued to teach them the tricks they had struggled with in Japan, but Kumiko was depressed and sadly died soon after. Makaiko was once again moved, this time to the island of Isla Mujeres.  While the tanks here were bigger, the dolphins were still given punishingly little food and Lopez took sympathy. I would always come back at night to give them some extra food so they wouldn’t be as hungry, she said. The water was too warm, leading to skin irritations and fungus infections. The sun was too bright, causing skin burns. The dolphins were getting weaker each day. Concerned about the animalsapos welfare, Lopez supported a rescue mission which failed. The trainer was fired over her involvement and was only allowed to come back one more time to say goodbye to the dolphins, which was one of the hardest days of her le. Distressed dolphin dumped for being apostoo fatapos For Makaiko, however, the stakes were even higher. When it came time for his pod to be moved again, he was said to be a foolish performer who refused to listen to orders and was deemed too big and too heavy. While the rest of the animals were transported to another island, he was left behind - increasingly lonely and depressed. He stayed alone for some time, without food, and with a growing sense of anxiety he started banging his head against the walls, said Lopez. At some point, people would come in with dead fish, and to clean the water. This was the only time Makaiko wasn’t alone. Makaikoaposs fortunes changes after an intervention by the Mexican government. He was rescued and placed with a company called Aqua World, where Lopez was able to lead a rehabilitation process. Yet the years of mistreatment had left a deep impression on the distressed dolphin, who continued to self-harm. He was finally transported to Dolphin Discovery at Isla Mujeres, where he would see out the last four years of his le. While he was able able to swim in the ocean once more, it was only in a confined area and he was required to perform for crowds again. One day, following Tropical Storm Emily, tragedy struck. Nets had been put down due to the destruction and Makaiko got tangled up in them, said Lopez. The people looking after them didn’t see any of this, so Makaiko died. He lay tangled up in the nets in the dolphin venue where he was exploited to entertain thousands of people.Got a story  Get in touch by emailing alex.bellotti@reachplcComment MORE ON DolphinsAnimals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

all within just  days.TheAberdeen runner certainly plans to enjoy a short break from serious training after an epic fortnight of endurance running, which took him from Berlin to Bennachie with a stopover in London.Christie#s trip to Germany at the tail end of September was always his top target for the year and he delivered the goods in fine style.The -year-old engineer completed the Berlin race in hr min secs to slash a whopping mins off his previous best time set at Chicago in .Seven days later, on the streets of London, he produced another solid marathon performance, clocking ::.That would have been a big enough double to satisfy most runners, but Christie was on a roll and decided to complete his -day tour closer to home by tackling the Bennachie ultra trail k.And, to cap a memorable spell of muscle-buckling action, he battled round the rain-sodden course in :: to take top spot.Christie said: #Berlin was my main target race and London was a back-up in case travel restrictions prevented me from getting to Germany.#Bennachie was another back-up. I didn#t intend to do it, but it#s a nice race and, as I was feeling OK after the two marathons, I decided to have a pop.#Lockdown was kind to me as I was able to focus on my running.#In the lead-up to Berlin, I knew I was in good form and I was hitting  miles per week in training. It#s the first time I#ve got anywhere near that without falling apart.#In some of the races I did before Berlin, I realised I was in better shape than I thought, so I lowered my target time. I was swithering between aiming for : and :.#I didn#t quite get to the lower one, but it was a tough day, very hot. Also I got a stitch, which, although not debilitating, was definitely annoying and held me back.#I certainly feel I can get under : in the future.#In London I had no intention of going hard. I made a mess of it in  when, on another hot day, I got carried away at the start, but fell apart after k. So I had some unfinished business there and just wanted to do it properly.#The Bennachie result was a bonus for Christie, who finished third behind Great Britain mountain running international Robbie Simpson in the  race.Hisclubmate Jason Kelly, who was runner-up in , was also in the field, but he dropped out after around k.Christie said: #I was surprised when Jason pulled out and I found myself in the lead, which is not what I expected. I felt a bit of pressure then and, although I struggled towards the end, I was able to hang on.#Theman will enjoy a short recovery before possibly lacing up his trainers for another ultra race next month.He said: #I#ve signed up for the Dava Way k,  but I#m not sureI#ll do it.#It was originally scheduled for April, which would have been ideal, but was postponed until November. So, I#ll see how I feel nearer the time.#After that I#ll probably get stuck into some cross country races as I#d like to give that a go.#Christie has no definite marathon plans for the coming year, but is keen to complete the world majors series at some point in the future.He said: #I#ve done London, New York, Chicago, Berlin and Boston, so that just leaves Tokyo. But it might be tough to get into that one for the next couple of years as it has been postponed a few times.#I#ll probably do a marathon next spring, but at the moment I#ve no idea where that might be.#Aberdeen AAC#s Nichola Crawford and Bob Masson were honoured at the scottishathletics annual awards evening in Glasgow.Olympic track star Laura Muir picked up the main accolade when being named Athlete of the Year following her m silver medal and British record in Tokyo.Crawford was named Community Coach of the Year and Masson, who has been involved in the sport for well over  years as a respected competitor, coach and official, was made an honorary le member of scottishathletics.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week september 24 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowI had the wonderful privilege the other week of holding a new grandson for the first time.Isn#t it amazing how a new-born infant can grab hold of your heart  I was filled with so much love and pride and I prayed that his le would be blessed.It so happened that the Gospel reading set for the Sunday after I met my grandson was, in part at least, about a little child.​Mark tells us Jesus was walking ahead of his disciples on the way to Capernaum. When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another. It is not about me, my job, my reputation, my status.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

Yet we often treat them in a dismissive way.Let#s think about some insects.Take the bluebottle. How often has it outwitted us with its amazing flight paths, ducking and ing to avoid our threatening gestures.While we have developed some of the most sophisticated flying machines the world has known, none can match the bluebottle in its agility.We have mentioned pollination. What insect is more important than the bee as it goes about its business from flower to flower ensuring that the plants will produce seed for another year and giving us honey as a product of its labours.How beautul too are its colours and the structure of its body – a remarkable little insect.Then there is the humble moth and its gravity-defying antics walking across ceilings. It has a very fragile body but in its short le can nevertheless act out its own acrobatic skill in an amazing performance.Or we may think of the spider and the beauty of its web, perhaps seen on a frosty winter morning. A true work of art woven with such delicacy.In the bible we read this: #Go watch the ants, you lazy person. Watch what they do and be wise. Ants have no commander, no leader or ruler, but they store up food in the summer and gather their supplies at harvest.# From this we can learn four things helpful to living: be diligent and hard-working have an #I can do it# attitude plan ahead remember teamwork is important."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader october 1 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowIt#s a strange one, the fuel situation.There seems to be no one reason for it but, for whatever reason, a sort of mass hysteria seems to have taken hold where in the UK.

This week, reporter Hilary Scott speaks to two men who, for several years, have helped people in the Borders...Itrsquos hard to believe that the Peeblesshire Foodbank has been running for almost a decade.When Francis Mordaunt and James Adams decided to join the small team of volunteers, they all thought the foodbank would be short-lived, a stop-gap while the economy recovered from the financial collapse.But the desperate crisis of people going hungry continued to rise, and the impact of the pandemic was felt most deeply by poorer households.Former manager Francis, and team leader James, have now retired from their roles.This week, they told me how the foodbank went from operating from a garage with a few referrals, to becoming a registered charity with premises in Cavalry Park, feeding hundreds of people across the county.The foodbank was formed in  following a meeting held at St.Peters Episcopal Church, initiated by the Rector Rev Jim Benton-Evans.Rev Jim was chairman, Katie Buckingham was secretary, and the manager was Gillian Hughes. The board of governors included several clergy, a headteacher, a local councillor and several others, who decided to operated under the auspices of The Trussell Trust, who were involved in many other foodbanks in the UK.Francis retired to Peebles that year and joined the congregation of St Peterrsquos.ldquoHaving told Rev Jim that I was interested in becoming involved in the community, he invited me to become a volunteer, he said.ldquoMany years earlier, while living in Edinburgh, I had helped at the Old St.Pauls Ritz Cafeacute that provided breakfasts during the week to the homeless men and women in the Grassmarket and central Edinburgh. So volunteering at the foodbank in Peebles appealed to me as it was another opportunity to help those who for whatever reason were going hungry.Initially, Francisrsquos voluntary role was packing food parcels at the Bakehouse Hall and delivering them.ldquoIn those early days, the food was stored in Enid Clariersquos garage in March Street Lane, he said.In Autumn , local MP David Mundell officially opened the Peeblesshire Foodbank, and Francis was appointed treasurer.Francis said: ldquoI inherited a positive bank balance from the initial fundraising efforts before I became a volunteer. Unfortunately, our costs were almost non-existent, so there was little to do the first purchase I remember was a set of scales as the Trussell Trust required us to weigh all food donations in and out and record them on a central database.The foodbank soon moved to more permanent premises in Cavalry Park with storage space for food donations.Francis added: ldquoWe now had a modest rent to pay, insurance costs and a mobile phone but few other costs. The Trussell Trust required us to become a charity, and Rev Jim asked me to complete the application to the Scottish Charity Commission.The Peeblesshire Foodbank became a registered charity in January , and two years later, Rev Jim handed over the reins of the foodbank.Before departing, he set up a management structure to ensure the foodbank continued to run smoothly.Francis, who was appointed as manager, worked with team leader James Adams.Rev Callum MacDougall was the chairman until his retirement in , when Father Tony Lappin took up the position.ldquoOnce the pandemic hit the premises at Cavalry Park became hopelessly small, and Father Tony arranged for the foodbank to move temporarily to St Josephrsquos Hall, explained Francis.ldquoSo one of my last actions for the foodbank before retiring was to arrange the rental of the new much bigger premises in Cavalry Park where the Peeblesshire foodbank is now located.Since its inception, the number of people reaching out to the foodbank for help has grown rapidly.ldquoIn the early years, we had up to two referrals a week, about  a year with an average of two people fed per referral. That meant we were feeding about  people a year, said Francis. ldquoBy , that had increased to nearly  people a year, and by  it was over .Francis said the role made him quite emotional at times: ldquoIn several cases, the recipients burst into tears on receiving their food parcels delivered to their doors. It meant a lot to me to see the gratitude as the foodbank was meeting an urgent need.Jamesrsquos involvement in the foodbank echoed Francisrsquos, as he retired to Peebles from Belfast in  and joined St Peterrsquos Church.He said: ldquoMy we and I were anxious to get involved with the community and make friends, and to help with a foodbank seemed a worthwhile opportunity.Recalling the old days when they used a garage to store food, James said: ldquoIt had no heat or light and littleany shelving, but it was a base. Donations were mainly from Tesco collections.ldquoThere was a book recording parcels issued, and my memory was that perhaps only four or five were issued in an average week, and there was a description of the call and the circumstances. I donrsquot think the availability of the Foodbank was well publicised at that time.However, he says there was a dficult period when he and Francis struggled to keep up with demand.ldquoWe ended up covering  days at a time, which was not sustainable. We were, on average, delivering around eight parcels per week at that time.Appeals for help brought in big-hearted community volunteers.James said: ldquoWe were able to move to a four-week rota, and Billtook responsibility for uplting donations and collecting empty boxes. In addition, positive steps were taken to advertise the foodbank and increase usage, and leaders met at intervals to discuss all aspects of the foodbank. This was, I believe when things began to move forward.Although the charity had an army of volunteers, financial constraints were a concern.ldquoIn the beginning, money was scarce, and there was always a worrywe could continue to afford the premises when we moved to Caly Park, said James.However, both have paid tribute to ldquosuper fundraiser, Nancy Fenton.James added: ldquoNancy held a coffee morning and progressed from that to raising money by selling a wide iety of items online. The work she put in was phenomenal, as was the cash raised, but these efforts raised the profile of the foodbank as well. Her efforts gave us a very secure financial base which has provided some security as the Foodbank progresses.In addition, local churches, businesses, charities and iniduals raised funds for the foodbank, usually on their own initiative.And iniduals have been making financial donations directly to the bank account via the website.Francis added: ldquoDonations of food, particularly through the local supermarket collection points, always continued at a high level, and shortages were only ever confined to a relatively few inidual items. The generosity of the Peeblesshire community has been incredible.Reflecting on his days delivering food parcels to those in need, James said: ldquoThere were people, mainly those living alone, who I delivered to more than a few times. I rightly or wrongly felt that they found it dficult simply to cope with le in general, and the foodbank was essential to simply feed themselves.Ultimately, COVID and age marked the end of Francis and Jamesrsquos incredible journey with the Peeblesshire Foodbank.The Trussell Trust stood down everyone over the age of  years.During the pandemic, one thing thatrsquos brightened our lives has been the stories of the everyday heroes doing their bit to support people through these dficult days.Together, these two selfless gentlemen worked tirelessly for several years making sure struggling families had a meal to put on the table.They are the retiring heroes behind Peeblesshire Foodbank, who helped countless people."},{"url":null,"title":"former-jed-forest-star-completes-ninth-charity-marathon","story":"FORMER Jed-Forest star Chris Laidlaw is now three quarters of the way through his lsquo in  marathon challengersquo.Laidlaw, who hails from Jedburgh has been running a marathon each month this year to raise funds for three charities which mean a lot to him - the Murrayfield Injured Players Foundation Marie Curie and Alzheimerrsquos Scotland.His first marathon took place on New Yearrsquos Day on a -mile course near Edinburgh and since then he has run another eight.This was ato happy territory for him as he set out from Fisherrow Harbour in Musselburgh and finished at Hallhill, home ground for Dunbar Rugby Club, where he spent three years as Development Officer.He said: ldquoThe marathons donrsquot get any easier.

defeat.And last Saturday#s defeat came about through a goal each in the early and late stages of the match, despite a strong showing from the Kintyre Park side.Playing in a ---, Tarbert#s Craig Johnstone ed to central defence and John McCallum played on the left wing in place of the unavailable Rhys Casci, while Liam Renton ed to the fray on the right of the front three, in place of the injured Ross Brown.To compound all the chopping and changing of the team beforehand – a common feature of Pupils# line-ups due to injuries and work commitments in recent weeks – the Kintyre side suffered a huge setback on the pitch after two minutes.A Finnart corner, for all the world a Pupils# goal kick, was awarded by the referee, and the visitors# near-post delivery was flicked on and erted into the net by a Finnart head at the back post.Although the award of the corner was thought to be unjust, the home side was left reflecting on a set piece which could have been defended much better.The McFadyens-sponsored Pupils gradually settled into the game after this early shock and enjoyed decent spells of possession,perhaps only resulting in half-chances at goal – notably through a Scott Souden header which went narrowly by the post – throughout a tightly-contested first half.After the interval, the Pupils continued to press for an equaliser, but their battle-hardened visitors, who have enjoyed the winning habit for most of this season so far, were well organised in defence, with experienced substitutes adding a calmness to their play.Nevertheless, working hard in search of an equaliser, the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils had a foray into the Finnart box midway through the second half when Stuart Crossan played in John McCallum with a deft flick, but the latter#s right-footed shot flashed wide of the Finnart goal.McCallum found space in the box again soon after and cut the ball back to Scott Souden, a little too far behind, but was bailed out by the onrushing Liam Renton, who looked to have the goal at his mercy, but somehow a Finnart defender got back to block the close-range effort.Meanwhile, Pupils captain Keith Mitchell had switched from a midfield berth to left back during the second half, and the change was bearing fruit with a good deal of the Pupils# play developing down this flank.However, more frustration was to follow for the home side in the rd minute, as the Pupils# defence was exposed in a two-vs-one situation and an unmarked Finnart forward latched on to a through-ball and lashed a shot beyond young Pupils #keeper Alasdair Ferguson to give the visitors an unassailable - lead with so little time remaining.It was a bitter blow for the home side having put so much effort into earning at least a point, but hopefully it can be taken as another lesson in game management from an experienced and well-drilled opponent.Tomorrow , the Pupils are on their travels, taking on Paisley outfit Glenvale FC on league duty at the town#s Ferguslie Park. Kick off is pm.For more information follow @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week october 8 2021","story":"I love how the green leaves of the trees slowly change into a golden yellow colour before the tree disperses of them and they gently fall to the ground.The tree seeks a time of rest in winter and therefore needs to let go of all its decayed leaves so that it can bud in spring and flourish in summer.Watching this process reminds me of an important lesson that we can learn from the trees as we enter into the autumn period and look ahead to the winter months.Just as the trees don#t stubbornly hold onto their dead leaves, so must we seek not to hold stubbornly onto any unnecessary hurtful weight in our lives.Ephesians  v  –  reminds us that we need to get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice.Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.Are you perhaps holding onto something that is preventing a freshness to the season ahead Could it be that the decayed leaves are piling up in your heart and you need to discard of them for good If so, why not reach out to the Lord in prayer because He longs to hear from you.Ask Him to reveal any thoughts, circumstances, issues, or any other #decayed leaves# that you may be stubbornly clinging to, so that you can release them and watch the leaves fall and drt away this season."},{"url":null,"title":"three points for pupils u17s after incredible comeback","story":"Campbeltown Pupils s ed to Kintyre last Sunday with three points after a remarkable Glasgow and District Youth Football League match.Trailing -

The Tempest tells the tale of le on a tiny fantasy island after a shipwreck, a perfect allegory for the Covid pandemic.The central character, Prospero, is the leader of the island, a Boris in fact, and a man more desperate to cling onto power that Dame Cressida Dick. Prospero and Boris are also crowd pleasers, plate-spinners, smoke-and-mirrors practitioners desperate to maintain the illusion of positivity but both are in denial of the realities all around them.Yes, there is a perceived geniality both characters, but itrsquos all a front for an underlying need to dominate. And both are surrounded by evil goblins. Now, no one is saying that Boris Johnson would, as Prospero did, marry off his daughter in order to maintain control of the island. But didnrsquot he offer up his new partnerfor every cosy photo opportunity available And didnrsquot he show Prospero-like indference when he sacriced the likes of Matt Hancock and Dominic Cummings  Doesnrsquot he employ a series of ruthless Calibans, a character described by Shakespeare as a lsquoshoe lickerrsquo.It seems perfect timing that director Andy Arnold has determined to resurrect The Tempest. Itrsquos a play thatrsquos dreamlike, surrealromantic and cruel  Doesnrsquot that sum up the situation in our own little island right now Itrsquos also a play about the marginalisation and fragility of women. .Yet, you make look at the casting of an all-female cast of  women and raise your eyebrows. What in the name of Gielgudis going on  And shouldnrsquot we expect the evil Caliban to be played by Lenny from River City But bear this in mind three years ago, the Tron launched Pride and Prejudicewith an all-female cast wearing frocks and Doc Martens. And I had more reservations than the Sioux. Yet, it was wonderful and has now transferred to Londonrsquos West End.Forgiveness and repentance are themes which emerge in the end of the play. Did Shakespeare anticipate that the courts of Covid inquiry will find in favour of those who behaved so egregiously, or that politicians will rush to declare mea culpa Maybe Will wasnrsquot so great on endings.The Tempest, Tron Theatre, Glasgow.

On a recent visit to my previously-NHS dentist I found that a somewhat complicated filling would cost me pound-plus. I asked the dentist when NHS dentistry would be fully restored and her sharp blunt answer was \"never\".Dentists have written in your pages detailing this sad situation but here it was in reality. A major part of our heath service has been de facto privatised, not by common knowledge but by stealth. Our First Minister should come clean over this dreadful situation but I seriously doubt it.As time goes by when Ms Sturgeon waves to her adoring fans with her gleaming smile I think she will be faced by an increasingly toothless, gurning audience, not just because of a lack of another independence referendum but due to lack of a dentistry service.Scotlands NHS safe with the SNP  The evidence says otherwise.Ian McNair, Cellardyke.OUR NHS IS NOT WELLTHE pandemic is on the wane yet Scottish AE waiting times have recorded their worst figures ever. More than one in four patients are waiting more than four hours to be seen . This is because the underlying NHS problems have not been fixed by successive SNP health ministers and the reason is obvious. None of them fully understood not only the problems but that SNP policies are simply making things worse.Staffing levels are inadequate but high taxation by the SNP means the higher-grade posts remain unfilled. The SNP used to counter this by claiming the quality of le was generally better in Scotland but this is patently not the case. Scotlands NHS is not well in SNP hands and the new Green input will inevitably steer it onto the critical list.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.STURGEON MYTH NOW EXPOSEDIT is now very clear that the report issued by cross-party committees at Westminster on the UK Governmentrsquos initial handling of the Covid crisiscompletely busts the well-spun myth that Nicola Sturgeon was far superior and supposedly dferent in her handling of this crisis. Additionally, the committeersquos reportdid not have to consider the implications of not telling the Scottish public of the Nike conference outbreak.If Ms Sturgeon wants us to believe that she is all about transparency, accountability and responsibility, then she must immediately establish a Scottish Parliamentary inquiry to establish the truth. Any further spin or obfuscation on this matter would be an insult to us all.Richard Allison, Edinburgh.OPPOSITION HAS MEMORY PROBLEMSAS the Scottish Government is in the process of preparing a judge-led inquiry into the handling of Covid, calls for a parliamentary inquiry would be a waste of time and effort given the tribal nature of politics at Holyrood. To date, the Welsh Labour Government has refused to commit to holding an inquiry into its handling of the pandemic.Any inquiry should examine Scotlandrsquos lack of border controls and borrowing powers to enforce an earlier lockdown and the fact that it was only when Scotland erged from the UK approach that we got on top of the virus with the resultant better figures than where. It should also examine the preparedness of private care homes to accept and isolate hospital discharges.Opposition politicians at Holyrood have memory problems, as in early March  they were demanding that Nicola Sturgeon free up hospital beds to cope with the expected tsunami of patients and at that time Ms Sturgeon was criticised for pushing for lockdown while Boris Johnson was shaking hands with Covid patients and saying it was business as usual.In stark contrast to Englandrsquos expensive PPE procurement scandal, Audit Scotland found that the Scottish Government acted fairly and appropriately when awarding contracts.The latest AE figures in Scotland may look bad but they are still far superior to those in England or Wales.Covid mistakes were made, but we should be grateful for our much-better-performing NHS Scotland.Mary Thomas, Edinburgh.WHAT TO DO IF THERES NO OUT DOOR I LIKE Adam Tomkins with his constitutional hat on, rather than his political one law has left us with an elephant in the room, The Herald, October . The issue of constitutional sovereignty in a multi-national state lying with a parliament overwhelmingly dominated by one of those nations, is surely one fraught with problems. Mr Tomkins references that Westminsterrsquos sovereign hand reaches out, not just to Scotland, but to Wales and Northern Ireland as well, yet Northern Ireland has had its ldquoright to self-determination recognised within the constitutional architecture of the UK, through the Downing Street Declaration and the Good Friday Agreement. We all know why that is.What of the concept of ldquopopular sovereignty: government based on the consent of the people, which Scots believed in  The Conservative Party has fought numerous elections in Scotland now, on one single issue, and has lost badly on every occasion, yet insists on its hegemony over Scotland. When democracy is made irrelevant, and the courts are skewed to a th century English constitutional conceit, where is the legal and constitutional road to Scottish self-governance  If there is no ldquoout door what comes next GR Weir, Ochiltree.BIAS OF THE YES QUESTIONALLOW me to correct Alasdair Galloway , who accuses me of being ldquodisingenuous in the extreme\" in his mistaken belief that I ldquochampion\" the question ldquoShould Scotland remain in the UK  Yes or No\". I was not attempting to champion anything. All I was doing was making the very simple point that such wording was not at all dficult to understand, contrary to Robert Frazers assertionthat many people would be confused by it.That I object to any referendum question involving a ldquoYes or No\" answer should be obvious to any regular correspondent such as Mr Galloway from my occasional letters in The Herald on that very subject. As I have said each time, any such question is inherently biased in favour of ldquoYes\". That is the stated view of the Electoral Commission, and I am glad to see that Mr Galloway, in his reference to that commission, appears to share that view.Alan Fitzpatrick, Dunlop.SUCCESSORS TO UKIPBILL Brownattributes support for Scottish independence to \"the fickle and impetuous inexperience of youth\". As a regular pro-independence contributor to these pages, born during the Second World War, perhaps Mr Brown will enlighten me as to how many more years I must wait for the dawn of maturity.The rising support for Ukip south of the Border a number of years ago was reminiscent of events in s Germany and concentrated my mind on the need for our Scottish nation to free itself from the xenophobic tide that was engulfing our neighbours. The impetuous younger generation of Scots is unlikely to have shared my concerns and will not be aware that todays UK Conservative and Labour parties are now dressed in many of Ukips clothes.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.SHAMEFUL DAMAGE OF BREXITHOW well Dave Stewartarticulated my own view of the regret many must be feeling about the consequences of Brexit. If ever nose was cut off to spite face, the folly of the blinkered pursuit of such an isolationist policy in a global age beggars belief.Alas, apologies do not come easy in the current political climate, so we seem lumbered with this ideological nightmare. I suspect Mr Stewart will wait a long time for any sort of apology from Leave voters.As a long-established small business owner, increased costs and hassle are an inevitable consequence as a grandmother, the diminished options for my grandchildren to travel and study abroad are damaging and shameful.Most of all, the inconsistency of orcing from our neighbours in Europe, while insisting Scotland is better off shackled to an increasingly inward-looking UK Government, surely raises serious questions for all our futures.Anne Shackleton, Kirkcudbright.IS THERE A VITAL SPARK WILLIAM Shatnerrsquos trip into spaceI guess will be cited as another example of le imitating art.

Many are under pressure from parents and teachers. There are parents who think that any form of manual work is for other peoples children, and many schools are desperate to send pupils to university to make their stats look good.I fully appreciate that there are horses for courses and pupils with no manual skills may be better in academia or higher education. However, those who have could be utilising these skills to the nations benefit. I recently required the services of a plumber for a non-emergency repair and was very lucky to get one within three days. In conversation with this self-employed tradesman I discovered that he had, and has always had, more work than he can handle. The same applies to the roofer who cleans our roof gutters each winter. I have two nephews, both tradesmen, who have never been unemployed since leaving school  years ago. The supposed statistics that a graduate will earn more than a tradesman in a letime may be wishful thinking in the present state of our economy.It would be interesting to get the stats of the percentage of university students gaining jobs related to their degree, versus the apprentices leaving vocational education and into their desired vocation. Many graduates are in relatively menial jobs just to earn a living. This must be soul-destroying and demotivating and not what they signed up for. Successive governments have failed to invest in vocational education and as Mr McCrindle rightly states, due to this, we will be at a disadvantage as a nation for many years to come.Ian Smith, Symington.WHY MARYS CAUSE WAS DOOMEDROSEMARY Goring refers to the \"unhappy career\" of Mary Queen of Scots . I believe that one of the most unfortunate aspects of that career was the nature of her relationship with her son, James VI. She states that James did nothing to facilitate his mother being released from captivity in England and that he had been reared to \"despise and detest her\".The controlling Protestant interests in Scotland determined that Jamesrsquos education should be placed in the hands of the historian and scholar George Buchanan, who set out during that process to turn him against his mother. James did not know his parents. His upbringing was, therefore, very much influenced by Buchanan, who had become one of the strongest critics of his mother. Given that background, it comes as not much of a surprise that the proposal for Mary, a Roman Catholic and James, a Protestant, to share the Scottish throne was not further pursued.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.SAD LACK OF ALARMS LAW PROTESTLIVING in a complex of some  flats, all of which have some form of fire heat alarms, it was more than interesting to read Christopher W Ides letter ,with its reference to the excellent letter of September  from Neil Sinclair, formally of Strathclyde Fire Brigade, on the subject of the necessity of every house in Scotland now having to be equipped with an upgraded fire alarm system by February,  . While it is clear that it will not be a criminal offence it seems that it will be enforced by the local authorities .The devil lies where. It is probable that before a residence can be sold, the Home Report that has to be filed, and complied with, will require the residence to have the requisite number of alarms.What is surprising is the total lack of response from housing associations and local authorities. It is a great pity that more voices have not been raised in protest. As to expecting the law makers to change their minds in response to logical argument and practical advice: nae chance.Robin Johnston, Newton Mearns.TIME TO TALK ABOUT MENWITH previous excellent coverage by female columnists on endometriosis, period poverty, the menopause, faulty breast and pelvic mesh implants, more recently a correspondents schooldays racy bottle-green knickers , the intricacies of corsets , and a refresher course on female anatomy , the Letters Editor can be reassured regarding his query ldquoDo readers think The Herald is too male oriented  .Apart from regular reports on goals scored and missed penalties assessed, perhaps gender balance could be addressed by informed comment on erectile dys, boxer shorts and baldness for the male readership.R Russell Smith, Largs.DITCH THE HANDBAG, MAAMLOVELY pictures abound of the Queen walking for the first time in public with the aid of a stick .

I thought it might be fitting for the bell to be recommissioned and used again in remembrance of the  lives lost.”Towards the end of , Bill contacted a local craftsman and friend, Richard Wilson, and askedhe could help. It had been hoped to have the clapper made and fitted ready for the anniversary in , however plans had to be delayed due to the pandemic.In the meantime, Richard carried out online research and was eventually able to get inside the Cathedral to measure up, acquiring the bronze for the clapper proved dficult locally so he had to source it online.“It took me around a fortnight to make the clapper in my shed at home mostly using a hobby lathe and a CNC router,# said Richard.#I was a bit taken aback when Bill asked me to do this for him. Obviously, it is a great honour and a privilege for me to be asked considering the history of the ship and the lives lost during the sinking.#Hopefully this clapper will be around for years to come and will be used to commemorate the event each year.”However, this was only half the tale. The clapper needed a tassel — a rope that someone would actually hold to ring the bell.Fran Hollinrake is the visitor services officer and custodian at the cathedral.She said that, having attended several commemorations over the years, her and her husband Andy became friendly with a couple, John and Tracy Welch.John’s father, Stoker Petty Officer John Welch, was on board HMS Royal Oak the night she sank, but he survived.His son, John, was a rigger in the Tyneside dockyards, and spent much of his working le working with ropes, but ill-health prevented John from making the tassel.Instead he passed the job on to his former apprentice and friend Paul New.John and his we Tracy arrived in Orkney this week and were present at the unveiling.John said of his father#s experience on that fateful night: #The night of the sinking he was on deck having a cigarette when the explosion happened. He managed to get off the ship and into the water and was picked up by the Daisy II.#He said he had held on to another chap in the water who was in dficulty,  as he was an excellent swimmer and had medals for le saving and water polo, but when they were both pulled aboard by the crew of the Daisy unfortunately the other chap had died. He was lucky to escape with burns to his hands and face.#After medical attention I think a week or so later he was sent back to Portsmouth to join another ship.“As I far as I can remember he never ed to Orkney, but after the war attended the reunions in Portsmouth on a regular basis. As for his feelings about that night it wasn’t something he went into in great detail, but he did say thathe could get back on the ship he would know exactly where his gold lighter and cigarette case were.#Representing the council, who maintain the Cathedral on behalf of the people of Orkney, Councillor Stephen Clackson also has a personal connection to the Royal Oak, having tragically lost his uncle Ronald George Clackson when the ship went down.He said: “My Uncle Ronny was the closest sibling in age to my dad and his favourite brother. He was very technically minded and joined the Royal Navy on July , , aged ¾, for ‘  ’ years.#After training at the shore establishment HMS Victory, he was posted to the recommissioned HMS Royal Oak as an ordinary seaman on June , , when the ship was expected to be embarking on a -month tour of the Mediterranean.#Looming hostilities set the course of the battleship in another direction, and by August she was in Scapa Flow. My uncle was reported missing presumed killed when the Royal Oak was sunk by torpedoes from the U- in the early hours of October , just a week after his th birthday.#The news was devastating for my grandmother, whose brother had been killed on the Somme in World War I at the same age, and she never really got over it.

The process is known as appointing a ldquosupplier of last resort .Customers are not able to choose their new supplier, with Ofgem picking a company it deems capable of supplying additional customers ldquoas soon as possible.The watchdogrsquos safety net ensures customersrsquo energy supplies will not be disrupted and any credit balances will be protected. vw,vw,px, px\"ndash Do I need to do anything No. The best advice is to sit tight and wait for your new supplier to contact you to avoid problems with the switch and protect any credit balance yoursquove accumulated.You should, however, take a meter reading as it will be useful ndash but not essential ndash for when your new supplier contacts you.It is also wise to download or screenshot latest energy bills, current direct debit and credit amounts, and yearly usage. A failed firmrsquos website can go offline, so it is sensible to gather this information as quickly as possible.Those who already have a switch to a new firm in process will continue to be moved over.ndash Should I cancel my direct debit Ofgem advises that customers can cancel their direct debitthey want to.

For example, they might have to buy extra wholesale energy at short notice for new customers, so they charge more to make up for it.However, deemed contracts tend to be at the price cap, and the current spike in wholesale prices means firms are not currently offering any deals that are cheaper than this for new customers, so you are unlikely to save by switching.ndash When can I switch to another company or deal of my choice After the new supplier has taken over, customers are free to shop around, and are able to move where ndash or be switched to a cheaper tarf with the same supplier ndash without being charged exit fees.ndash Do companies want all these new customers Taking on new customers can be very expensive. Not only does the new supplier have to pay staff to manage the process, it also has to buy the energy that the new customers are expected to use in advance ndash up to a year ahead.According to some calculations it costs around pound, for every new household they take on.It also presents an administrative headache. A lot of the time the failed supplierrsquos computer system is not compatible with that of the new supplier, meaning details for thousands of customers may have to be entered manually.With the global price rise in gas pushing up costs to buy energy, we know this is a worrying time for many people and news of suppliers going out of business is unsettling.If a supplier exits the market, were making sure you are protected #https:t.co LtoJtsAN pic XLcPgwoNsLmdash ofgemSeptember , ndash Whatall suppliers refuse to take on new customers Ofgem tries to find a volunteer supplier to take on the failed companyrsquos customers. But technically it could force any supplier on the market to take them on.The regulator will avoid this as much as it can, because, in the worst case, the shock of extra costs could put the new supplier out of business, or make it harder for it to keep serving its existing customers.If no supplier of last resort can be found, Ofgem can turn to the Special Administration Regime.Although never used before, it lets Ofgem or the Business Secretary appoint an administrator to run the failed business until it can be sold, rescued, or its customers transferred where.That company can be given government grants or loans to allow it to keep the lights on for its customers.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

He gave an alcohol reading or  microgrammes per ml of breath, which is more than six times the limit.Just a week later, in the early hours of th August, officers on patrol noticed Willmottrsquos car with its lights on in a layby of the A near Voe,Willmott was in the driving seat, with the keys in the ignition. Although the engine was off at the time, officers noticed a rear brake disk was still warm.Willmott was again arrested and taken to the police station.

But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CATTLE-SALES-SEP-21-2-scaled.jpg","title":"remember your roots skye plan is urged to recognise","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThose were the comments of Roddy Murray, former Western Isles councillor and now the grazings clerk for Tarskavaig in Sleat, who this week voiced his concern that there was no mention of crofting at all in the ‘Skye and Raasay Future’ plan published in August with the full backing of all four local councillors.He told the Free Press: “There are  projects listed in the plan but not a single mention of crofting. Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1634132049562.jpg--covid_19___wed_13th_october_figures.jpg?1634132049000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211013newscovid 19 wed 13th october figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows one further coronavirus related death and  new positive test results.

And last week, Andrew Larmour of the Gertrude Star Flute Band ed to Ballymena to hand over a massive cheque for pound, to Jake and his mum Karen who live in Ballykeel.Back in September, Andrew and fellow Star members were joined by members of Ballymena-based flute bands on the long, footsore trek.And while they may well be used to stepping out on parade the local bandsmen can justiably claim to have gone the extra mile on their mega march for a cause close to their hearts.Five-year-old Jake was diagnosed with lymphoblastic lymphoma in September .Lymphoblastic lymphoma is a very rare cancer that affects the blood cells and the immune system of the patient and mainly affects children between the ages of  and .When Jake woke with a wheezy chest, his mum Karen contacted the GP straight away. Jake was prescribed anti-biotics and his mum was advised to use a humidier and also a steamy bathroom. There was no improvement in Jake’s condition and the family spent  weeks going back and forth trying to find out just why their little boy was so ill. Eventually a visit to AE and blood tests led to Jake being referred to the RVH Children’s Hospital where they received the devastating diagnosis.“It has been a really dficult time for Jake,” said Karen “as he missed all of his P year, with the exception of a few days. “We are all very grateful for the fantastic suppport we’ve received from these bandsmen.”Among the marchers in September was local councillor, Rodney Quigley who said that the joint effort by the band members was to be praised.“I couldn’t make the entire walk because of prior engagements but I was proud to be there at the .am start in East Belfast with my local band colleagues. “Jake has relations in the ranks of Gertude Star Flute Band and it was their idea to do the walk to Ballymena.“I know their fund raising page has received a lot of donations from local bands and its great to see such unity on the marching band front,” he said. One of the walk’s organisers, Gertrude Star’s Andrew Larmour said the walk to Ballymena was one of the proudest days of his le.“Walking with my Gertrude brothers and making three new friends for le in GeorgeBarr , Lyle Murray and Rodney Quigley was an honour.“It is great to know that we have helped Jake and his mum Karen Oliver through this event.” Karen and Jake were there to welcome the intrepid walkers to Ballymena and she said she was overwhelmed by the generosity shown.She said: “Tonight Jake,Emelia and I met up with everyone walking at Queen Street and finished the walk with them! “We cannot thank you all enough! Jake was a little out of sorts due to increasing his Saturday chemotherapy dosage but he just stayed in my arms and took it all in this evening.“ I wish I could thank absolutely every one in person for joining the walk and giving donations you have all blown us away by your generosity.”Last week. Andrew posted: “Went down to Ballymena to hand over what was raised on our sponsored walk a few weeks ago.  “Can now say after counting final total tonight cheque and cash pound was raised in aid of wee Jake Oliver. “Again Id like thank everyone that donated to the sponsored walk also the ones that took part on the walk and Gertrude Star , Pride of the Maine and Ballykeel LSOU bands. “Your generosity didnt go unnoticed thank you.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4156276.jpg--.jpg?1634197334000\n","title":"st vincent de paul member roadshow visits ballymena","story":"THE Society of St Vincent de Paul has hosted a series of Member Roadshows, visiting towns and cities across the province, to engage with members in person for the first time since March last year.As well as providing representatives of more than , members from  SVP Conferences across Northern Ireland with an overview of the Society and how it has responded to the tens of thousands who have needed its support most in the past  months. Together with its plans for Christmas  and beyond, the events provided delegates with an opportunity to meet Mary Waide who was elected Regional President for the North Region at the beginning of the pandemic.Following opening prayers and a welcome by Mary Waide, regional board members of SVP took to the stage to present ious aspects of the Society’s work to assembled guests representing their local SVP Conferences.Following a thought provoking spiritual reflection, board members presented the Society’s retail strategy for its  Vincent’s shops in Northern Ireland, a report of the outreach into prisons, details of how each Conference should report on its finances and new ways of adhering to policies and procedures for those being assisted by the charity and those providing the assistance.An interactive element encouraged guests to engage in a healthy discussion with board members before closing prayers. Mary Waide, Regional President of SVP North Region, said: “I am absolutely delighted with the success of this series of SVP Member Roadshows and the feedback from those who were able to attend.It was important for the SVP regional board to get out into our local communities having had such a long time apart from our members face to face. The focus of the roadshows were to primarily express our gratitude to our members for the sterling work they have been continuing to do on the ground to help those who have needed it most, during the most trying of times, and to share with them our SVP vision for the longer term. “The dedication of members of SVP has never been more important than it has been in the past  months. I know from experience how daunting it has been trying to help the vulnerable in our community without compromising or risking the health of those who are supporting those in need. As we move forward, it is my hope that our Conferences in County Antrim continue to go from strength to strength under the guidance of Frederic Ozanam who founded SVP almost  years ago.”SVP is an international charity and the largest voluntary charity in Ireland. SVP members in Northern Ireland work in all communities to support people whatever their background, who are experiencing poverty and social exclusion, promoting self-sufficiency and working for social justice. Every year SVP spends approximately pound million to help those experiencing poverty in Northern Ireland. Last year, SVP responded to tens of thousands of calls for assistance from members of the public.

The minister replied: “In line with the Conduct of Executive Business Protocol, matters discussed at the Executive Committee are confidential.”Ulster Unionist communities spokesperson Andy Allen said that, while he respects the minister’s response and the protocol for Executive Committee meetings, Ms Hargey did state on September  during an Assembly debate in respect of welfare mitigations: “I am glad that it is on the agenda for next week’s Executive meeting, and I will call on all parties around that Executive table to support me.”Mr Allen said: “The fact there has been no announcement on the introduction would indicate there’s been little or no progress.“I would expect the minister to be raising this matter at every meeting, asking Executive colleagues to support her call to have this matter put on the agenda to enable the legislation to be brought before the Assembly.

The Executive Office need to be challenged day and daily over their failure to deliver this — an explanation should be forthcoming for the continued delay.”Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong, deputy chair of the Communities Committee, said Mrs Hargey has confirmed to members that a launch of a review of welfare mitigations has now been delayed, with no new legislation coming forward until it has been completed.“I hope when it does appear, the minister closes the current loophole around the bedroom tax, as well as the scrapping of the so-called six month rule and shows support for mortgage payments,” she added.Last month, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill accused the DUP of “blocking” welfare mitigation legislation by preventing the issue from being included on the Executive’s agenda.“This issue has been delayed and has been stalled for far too long,” Ms O’Neill said.“And despite the best efforts, and I mean the best efforts, of the Communities Minister to bring forward the legislation that will put this to bed, once and for all, it has failed to get on the Executive agenda.“And that is really not acceptable, but it is for those who are blocking this matter from getting onto the Executive table to explain the rationale for their position. I can assure the members that the blockage does not rest with myself.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsDeirdre HargeyAndy AllenKellie ArmstrongDepartment for CommunitiesMichelle O#NeillMore On Deirdre Hargey‘Dismantling barriers’: Belfast writer Sharon Dempsey welcomes decision to scrap library fines£.m public realm scheme announced for Banbridge town centreCall for Stormont to establish fuel poverty taskforce amid rising energy costs PremiumRevealed: £m in funding to help welfare claimants was handed back after being left unspentStormont department bids for £m to fund Universal Credit uplt… but cost will jump to over £mMost ReadNI school’s two weeks to find £k or risk losing grammar statusMurdered mum Katrina Rainey saw daughter die in accidentNI doctor who went to work in hospital while drunk avoids being struck offThe final cover up in Ireland: Ex-Noraid chief and IRA supporter Galvin in legacy talks with NI Secretary LewisHatchback for the price of a luxury x: Expat stunned by £, -day car hire quote in NITop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Murder investigation launched after woman dies in Knockcloughrim car firePlayIrish leaders hopeful of Northern Ireland Protocol agreement \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news efff .ece AUTOCROP wh fafeaedaedccae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news efff .ece AUTOCROP wh fafeaedaedccae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Viable device discovered during east Belfast alertLatest Northern IrelandLewis failed in legal duty to provide NI women with access to full abortion services, judge rulesHigh Court dismisses farmer’s legal challenge over RHI subsidy cutsLinfield and Coleraine fighting for £k prize in newly revamped All Ireland cup competitionDerry GAA have stated their intent with new three-year deal for manager Rory GallagherLewis failed to comply with duties over lack of abortion services, judge rulesLatestLewis failed in legal duty to provide NI women with access to full abortion services, judge rulesBen Affleck: Misogynist institutions create people who reflect those valuesBritain no longer has God-given right to rule the waves, ministers toldGlenrothes mosque attack: Suspect said arson plan was a joke, court toldPolice chief says statistics show pitchside drinking laws should not be relaxed,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A spokesperson added: Numerous factors, from access to staff and dficulties in vehicle supply due to the current semi-conductors crisis and the related fleet shortage, to the increased levels of cleaning between rentals weigh on the costs for the rental sector as a whole.Had Belfast native Colin been going in the opposite direction, and seeking to hire a car in France, he could have had a luxury Range Rover Velar — which costs nearly £, new — for the same money.He also revealed that he’d paid less than £ back in May  for BOTH his flights to and from Northern Ireland and car rental.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “I kept my receipt, which shows it cost just €.to hire a car from May  until May  in Northern Ireland two years ago,” he told this newspaper.“When I priced a similar car this time, the hire cost from October  until November  was between £, and £, for the cheapest vehicles.”Research from the Belfastdiscovered that it is possible to hire cheaper vehicles, but we also found that there are signicant iations in price, depending on the website you choose.We also discovered that higher prices are quotedyou are inquiring online from the EU, with the average hike around %. Colin said he consulted the Europcar site, which he’d used previously as it’s linked to the airline with which he is flying.Bewildered by the results, he revealed that he’d also looked at the price of hiring vehicles in Paris for the sake of comparison.“I decided to price an equivalent rental period in Paris and it was almost the exact same pricefor a Range Rover,” he said.“That’s quite a bargain, compared with the Vauxhall Crossland [worth £,] you’d get for the same money in Belfast.The -year-old continued: “Whatever way you look at it, the price of renting a vehicle in Northern Ireland has gone up by an astronomical amount.”Mr Young, who was hoping to hire a small car, said the cheapest available options he was quoted were a Vauxhall Corsafor £,. or a Crossland Xat £,..The pick-up and drop-off point on both vehicles on both dates was Belfast International Airport. “When I hired a car back in May  it worked out around £. a day,” he said.“ButI wanted to rent a similar vehicle this October, you’re talking about £. per day being advertised.”Colin, who lives with his partner Cecile and their son Joelin the French capital, made his original booking with Europcar, which he also consulted ahead of this year’s trip.But he revealed that he also checked the cost of car rental on other comparison websites, but found “they were all coming up the same”..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadNI school’s two weeks to find £k or risk losing grammar statusMurdered mum Katrina Rainey saw daughter die in accidentNI doctor who went to work in hospital while drunk avoids being struck offThe final cover up in Ireland: Ex-Noraid chief and IRA supporter Galvin in legacy talks with NI Secretary LewisHatchback for the price of a luxury x: Expat stunned by £, -day car hire quote in NITop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Murder investigation launched after woman dies in Knockcloughrim car firePlayIrish leaders hopeful of Northern Ireland Protocol agreement \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news efff .ece AUTOCROP wh fafeaedaedccae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news efff .ece AUTOCROP wh fafeaedaedccae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Viable device discovered during east Belfast alertLatest Northern IrelandPoultry farmer Thomas Forgrave loses legal battle over RHI subsidy cutsLeague Cup reaction: Caolan Loughran hailed for bouncing back from ‘abuse’ while Glentoran and Glenavon debate penalty controversyLewis failed in legal duty to provide NI women with access to full abortion services, judge rulesHigh Court dismisses farmer’s legal challenge over RHI subsidy cutsLinfield and Coleraine fighting for £k prize in newly revamped All Ireland cup competitionLatestPoultry farmer Thomas Forgrave loses legal battle over RHI subsidy cutsLeague Cup reaction: Caolan Loughran hailed for bouncing back from ‘abuse’ while Glentoran and Glenavon debate penalty controversyUlster vs Lions team news: Dan McFarland names unchanged team for United Rugby Championship clash at Kingspan StadiumQueen praises efforts of Welsh people during opening of Welsh ParliamentReading terror attacker loses bid to challenge whole-le sentence,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He offered to go with me to where I wanted to spend it to show it worked, he said.Another woman was on College Street when she was approached by a woman with a sleeping bag who also offered her £ voucher infor £ in cash.

There are a lot of people who are lost in the process and don#t know how to avail of the voucher either.​A spokesperson for Department for Economy said: “All illegal activity, or suspected illegal activity, should be reported to the PSNI”.The PSNI said it has not received any such reports..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsPolice Service of Northern IrelandDepartment for the EconomyMore On Police Service of Northern IrelandIntruder discovered in Omagh care home resident’s room PremiumMurdered mum Katrina Rainey saw daughter die in accidentFamily ask public for help in search for missing Lisburn man Roy William McKeeKnockloughrim murder: ‘Shock and disbelief’ in rural community after woman dies in car fire PremiumStormont mental health champion says it’s ‘vital’ police response to suicide is ‘compassionate’Most ReadNI school’s two weeks to find £k or risk losing grammar statusMurdered mum Katrina Rainey saw daughter die in accidentNI doctor who went to work in hospital while drunk avoids being struck offThe final cover up in Ireland: Ex-Noraid chief and IRA supporter Galvin in legacy talks with NI Secretary LewisHatchback for the price of a luxury x: Expat stunned by £, -day car hire quote in NITop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Murder investigation launched after woman dies in Knockcloughrim car firePlayIrish leaders hopeful of Northern Ireland Protocol agreement \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news efff .ece AUTOCROP wh fafeaedaedccae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news efff .ece AUTOCROP wh fafeaedaedccae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Viable device discovered during east Belfast alertLatest Northern IrelandPoultry farmer Thomas Forgrave loses legal battle over RHI subsidy cutsLeague Cup reaction: Caolan Loughran hailed for bouncing back from ‘abuse’ while Glentoran and Glenavon debate penalty controversyLewis failed in legal duty to provide NI women with access to full abortion services, judge rulesHigh Court dismisses farmer’s legal challenge over RHI subsidy cutsLinfield and Coleraine fighting for £k prize in newly revamped All Ireland cup competitionLatestPoultry farmer Thomas Forgrave loses legal battle over RHI subsidy cutsLeague Cup reaction: Caolan Loughran hailed for bouncing back from ‘abuse’ while Glentoran and Glenavon debate penalty controversyUlster vs Lions team news: Dan McFarland names unchanged team for United Rugby Championship clash at Kingspan StadiumQueen praises efforts of Welsh people during opening of Welsh ParliamentReading terror attacker loses bid to challenge whole-le sentence,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I had the opportunity to put strongly worded questions to Brandon Lewis about the British government’s legacy proposals and to put forward my views.“He was very engaging and responded directly. I told him the proposed amnesty will massively harm Britain’s standing in the US and urged him not to go ahead with it.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “I was surprised to get the invitation to meet him. The AOH was grateful of the opportunity to outline our views.”The Northern Ireland Office has been contacted for comment.The New York lawyer was banned from the UK in  but defied the authorities, appearing at an anti-internment rally in west Belfast. In an attempt to arrest him, the RUC stormed the crowd and shot dead Sean Downes with a plastic bullet. The ban was lted six years later.Once a close confidant of Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, Mr Galvin parted ways with Sinn Fein during the late s, becoming a staunch critic of the peace process and accusing the party of “abandoning republicanism”.He spoke at events supporting dissident republican prisoners and was a personal friend of Real IRA leader Mickey McKevitt and his we Bernadette Sands McKevitt.In his role as Freedom for All-Ireland chair in the AOH, Mr Galvin works with nationalist Troubles victims, campaign groups and others including Sinn Fein.AOH national vice-president Sean Pender accompanied the ex-Noraid leader to the meeting. “It lasted around  minutes. It was at British offices off Second Avenue. I led republican demonstrations to very near that location during the hunger-strike,” said Mr Galvin.“I told Brandon Lewis the amnesty proposal would represent the British government’s final cover-up in Ireland.“The AOH has been supporting the Ballymurphy massacre and Bloody Sunday families and many others for decades. An amnesty would not draw a line under the past but add a new chapter of hurt and injustice.“It wouldn’t herald an end to the battle for legacy truth but begin fresh court challenges that will cut across new generations. The Stormont House Agreement should be implemented.“I hope Brandon Lewis rethinks the proposals. He can be in no doubt of the opposition in Irish America, including in Congress, to them. Combined with that in Ireland, it has the potential to cause uproar and seriously harm his government’s credibility across the world.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsIRABrandon LewisMore On IRA PremiumMalachi O’DohertyOpinionNationalists can’t trust Boris Johnson... but neither can unionists PremiumGarfield Beattie: From UVF Glenanne murder gang member to painter of republican iconsNigel Farage: I was hoaxed into ‘Up the Ra’ birthday greetingFormer NIO boss Sir John Chilcot involved in IRA peace talks dies PremiumReport uncovers failures by police during probe into officer’s murderMost ReadNI school’s two weeks to find £k or risk losing grammar statusMurdered mum Katrina Rainey saw daughter die in accidentNI doctor who went to work in hospital while drunk avoids being struck offThe final cover up in Ireland: Ex-Noraid chief and IRA supporter Galvin in legacy talks with NI Secretary LewisHatchback for the price of a luxury x: Expat stunned by £, -day car hire quote in NITop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Murder investigation launched after woman dies in Knockcloughrim car firePlayIrish leaders hopeful of Northern Ireland Protocol agreement \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news efff .ece AUTOCROP wh fafeaedaedccae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news efff .ece AUTOCROP wh fafeaedaedccae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Viable device discovered during east Belfast alertLatest Northern IrelandLewis failed in legal duty to provide NI women with access to full abortion services, judge rulesHigh Court dismisses farmer’s legal challenge over RHI subsidy cutsLinfield and Coleraine fighting for £k prize in newly revamped All Ireland cup competitionDerry GAA have stated their intent with new three-year deal for manager Rory GallagherLewis failed to comply with duties over lack of abortion services, judge rulesLatestLewis failed in legal duty to provide NI women with access to full abortion services, judge rulesBritain no longer has God-given right to rule the waves, ministers toldGlenrothes mosque attack: Suspect said arson plan was a joke, court toldPolice chief says statistics show pitchside drinking laws should not be relaxedMy energy firm has gone bust.

It’s what you now do with that money that’s important because it can be easy to do nothing, and within a few months, the raise gets consumed by increased spending, and this is typically known as lestyle creep i.e. as your income increases, so do your outgoings, by the same amount.     Which is a shame because when you get a raise,put to good use, it should really put you ahead financially and allow you to achieve things, you were unable to on a lower salary.If you don’t take advantage and you’re not intentional with what you’re going to do with it, you end up in exactly the same position as before, and you’re just working harder without living better and that’s not what you want.So, how do you avoid this from happening to you Ideally, you want to give some thought into how you can benefit from your new higher earnings, and I will re-visit this in more detail, in a second follow article next week, because there’s a lot to cover.         However, I do know there are those who are just looking for a number, and don’t want to carry out that deep e into what impact a specic number would have on particular areas of their finances.So, with them and everyone  in mind, I’m going to share with you three very good rules of thumb that I like and think are useful.They were first developed by the financial services giant, Morningstar, and this is what they are suggesting you should do with a raise:. Spend twice your years to retirementIf you have  years to retirement, you can spend % of your raise and save the rest.. Save your age, as a % of the raiseIf you are  years’ old, save % of your raise.. Save at least % of your raiseRegardless of your age or years to your target date for retirement is, just save % of your raise.When Morningstar ran dferent scenarios, they discovered the spend twice your years to retirement created the biggest impact across all age groups because it usually involves saving the most money.The rules I’ve referred to focus on how much of the raise can be spent rather than how much can be saved, and that’s very deliberate i.e. you don’t want people to feel they have to save every extra cent they now earn and can’t enjoy some of the raise they received.Or do they have to save everything I’ll circle back to that in next weeks’ article.In the meantime, I want to make reference to the impact continuing to save a % of your income into your pension after a pay rise is, because its’ important.Pay Raise  PensionsSome people who receive a pay increase but make no % change to their pension contribution, think they are making progress, because they are saving a higher amount, right Wrong.If you continue to save for example % of your income, of course you’re increasing your saving because it’s % of a higher amount, butyou spend the other % and continue to do so, you are increasing your standard of living by % of every rise you receive.The danger with doing this, is that as your standard of living rises, the funding needed for retirement grows at a faster pace than the amount you are saving. Which results in the gap between what you need and what you save, becoming bigger every year.Let me explain.Let’s say your income was €, and it increased to €,.If you were saving % of your salary and continue to do so after your raise, you are increasing your annual contributions by €,, and you’re now saving €, per year.Whilst you might be saving more in absolute terms i.e. % of €, is obviously more than % of €,, you need to save more relative to how much your new salary is,you want to keep up with your new, higher costing lestyle.In this instance,you save % of your raise i.e. €, and add it to what you were previously saving i.e. €,, your new annual saving rate is €,.That % saving from your raise increases your contributions to, % of your new salary and that’s why you’re giving yourself an opportunity to fast forward retirement.What all that means is that the increased retirement savings, combined with the decreased need for retirement funds, means someone aged  who saves % of their raise can retire at , which is  years earlier than someone of the same age who only saved % of their raise.Regardless of your age, continuing to save only a certain % of your salary and spending the rest, including raises, is really poor advice because it can lead to delayed retirement and underfunded accounts, and that’s’ even when your savings rate is higher.Long story short, getting a raise can actually exacerbate the problem of having a fund which is lower than you need when you decide to retire full stop. Instinctively you might think it will help because you’re saving more money.But don’t forget you’re spending more as well and how are you going to replace that You’re certainly not going to do ityou continue to save the same % your currently saving.And let me repeat, even though you’re saving more because its % of a higher amount, when you run the math, it will tell you a dferent story.Okay, next week, I’ll look at people who are carrying high debt and or low savings and I’ll give you my opinion on how much of any raise they receive, they should spend.And in the same article, I’ll also tell you about someone who asked me recently what impact the raise she received would have on her finances. She wanted specic numbers and outputs on a number of dferent areas, and I’ll share with you what we discovered, and what she decided to do.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

The bank is ceasing services at  branches in the north of the the country, and a further  locations in the Republic as part of signicant changes to its branch network and local banking services first announced in March. googletag.cmd.push As part of the major restructuring of the bank, the Strand Road branch will close with customers still able to avail of services at the Culmore Road branch. Additionally, the branch in Limavady will also close, as well as branches in Strabane and Moville in County Donegal. It said that over the last three years, there has been a % drop in the number of customers visiting the branches in question, with a rise in those using online services. Bank of Ireland said an arrangement with the Post Offce, to allow for lodgements and withdrawals, will protect local access to over-the-counter banking, allowing account holders to conduct transactions at post offices around the country. Our personal customers may use any Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques, withdraw money using their debit card and check balances. Business Customers can use Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques withdraw money and check their balance with their Bank of Ireland UK Business Debit Card. Varying limits will apply to cash transactions, we will support customers to set up new arrangements including coin and larger cash transactions and are also planning to enhance services later this year.     Customers affected by the closures have been written to in recent months, informing them of the changes and outlining where their accounts will be transferred to. Account numbers, sort codes, along with direct debits and standing order arrangements, will remain in place. While most of the branches being closed have post offices nearby, customers wanting to access other Bank of Ireland services may now have to travel signicant distances to their closest branch. Revealed: Full list of  Bank of Ireland branch closures https:t.co DztGNaBSb — Irish Examiner October ,     The Financial Services Unionhas described the closures as a sad day for staff and customers and a real sign of the weakness of regulation in Ireland. John OConnell, General Secretary of the FSU, said Despite cross party opposition in the Daacuteil and in Stormont and across wide sections of the community, Bank of Ireland have continued along the pathway of eroding their footprint and removing vital services from communities across our country, The Regulator has clearly failed in its role of protecting customers and communities in this instance, he added. Mr. OConnell said the withdrawal of ATMs will mean there will be communities next week which will no longer have   access to cash adding that despite the increase in card payments, cash remains a vital payment method for customers. The FSU has called on the Central Bank to open a consultation paper on the future access to cash to ensure that the use of this access is safeguarded. It also called for the urgent consideration whether legislation and new enforcement powers are required in this area. Our banking sector is at a crossroads and needs a commitment from the Central Bank that the banking network will not disappear, and that they will be proactive in ensuring that communities and vulnerable people will not once again be hit the hardest, Mr OConnell added.

Dawn McLaughlin was speaking at the Londonderry Chamber’s President’s Annual Dinner in the Everglades Hotel in the city. Attended by over  business leaders, politicians, and civic leaders, the dinner was the first major Chamber event since March . googletag.cmd.push Sponsored by Find Insurance NI, the dinner was hosted by former broadcast journalist Sarah Travers and featured a ‘fireside chat’ with RTEacute Europe Editor and Brexit expert Tony Connelly, who is originally from the city. Dawn McLaughlin said now is the time for elected representatives, candidates, and ministers to prioritise Derry and the North West as we move closer to next year’s election and has called on parties to work constructively to rebuild the local economy after the impact of the pandemic. Chamber President Dawn McLaughlin said: “The pandemic has had a hugely detrimental effect on the North West economy, but I have been heartened and filled with pride by the way in which our local business owners and leaders reacted to the crisis before them. “The dinner is a fantastic occasion and opportunity to celebrate our resilience, recognise the strides we have made collectively over the past  months, and commend the efforts made by our local business community in protecting jobs and keeping their companies afloat in the most dficult of circumstances. “As we begin to come out the other side of the pandemic, the time is now for our ministers and our elected representatives at Stormont to prioritise the North West and deliver for our region.     “While the signing off of the Derry and Strabane City Deal and the opening of the School of Medicine at Magee earlier this year were welcome first steps, there is much more that needs to be done to address regional inequality in Northern Ireland and level up the North West City Region. “Ahead of the next Assembly election in spring next year, candidates from all political parties must commit to properly invest in our city, create and attract new jobs to our region, and address deficiencies in our economy. Opportunity “This includes committing to the full expansion of Magee, transforming our physical infrastructure to improve our connectivity to and from other economic hubs, marketing our region to businesses and investors across the globe as a prime location to do business, and properly supporting our businesses as they recover and rebuild post-pandemic. “There is now an opportunity for all key partners in our region – business leaders, elected representatives, educational institutions, civic leaders – to work together and make sure the North West builds back as strongly as it can after Covid, prioritising jobs, investment and prosperity for our businesses and our communities.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsPolice launch murder investigation after County Derry fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Paul Lavilleand James Donaghy, MD of Donaghy Bros, at the awards.Local NewsCounty Derry electrical retailer collects top award in London overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMickey left memories that will be cherished forever overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsPolice launch murder investigation after County Derry fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Paul Lavilleand James Donaghy, MD of Donaghy Bros, at the awards.Local NewsCounty Derry electrical retailer collects top award in London overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMickey left memories that will be cherished forever overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Hollywood star Jamie Lee Curtis could be making an appearance at s Derry Halloween event to promote the final part of the Halloween film trilogyLocal NewsScream Queen Jamie Lee pencils in Derry Halloween date overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Seamus Crossan ran  miles in  hours to raise poundk for Belmont CottagesDerry NewsDerry man runs  miles in  hours to raise poundk for wheelchair accessible vehicle for Belmont Cottages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Damian Brown pictured with his father Sean Brown during his playing days with Bellaghy.Local NewsTributes paid to gentleman Damian overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry teenager bit officer on the leg and spat at police overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood, has accused the DUP of setting themselves on a destructive course of action designed to antagonise nationalistsLocal NewsEastwood: Unionist threat of blocking Nationalist First Minister is insulting and pathetic overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

St Canices Wellbeing Group was recently formed with a view to offer confidential support and advice on a wide range of issues including mental health, addiction, sexuality, diet, health and bereavement. googletag.cmd.push On Sunday , the group host its first ever event – a k walk in support of World Mental Health Day. Dozens of people turned out to take part in what the committee hope will be the first of many events. St Canices GAC Chairman Kieran McKeever is just one of the committee members of the wellbeing group. He said a demand for support and services on emotional wellbeing, mental health and other issues was identied in the local area and committee members from sports clubs decided to come together to form the new group. “Its well known that mental health, obesity and addiction issues are really common nowadays and we thought that maybe we should take the lead and show people out there in the community that there is a bit of help there for anyone who may need it,” he said. “It started off as a small group but then we got members from the soccer club, the ladies football team, the camogie team and the football team involved so we could expand out and everyone could have access to the service.” The Wellbeing Group has also teamed up with ALPS , a community-based mental health initiative which has a satellite office in Dungiven, to provide additional support and services to the community.     St Canices Wellbeing committee member Julie-Anne Moore said: “The main aim of the group is to highlight the help and support that is available out there. At the minute,people go through the health service, the waiting lists are massive. We are able to signpost people to the support that is available out there. “As a result of covid, we have seen that many issues are coming to the fore and really we are just trying to be pro-active and raise more awareness and show people we are here and there is always someone to listen. “We would like to stress that everything is confidential and it wont be people in the committee that you will be talking to, itll be trained professionals. “We will also be covering all age groups and hope to organise a number of events and workshops in the future in conjunction with the local schools. It is never too early to start talking to children and discuss any issues they may have with them.” Sinn Feacutein Councillor Sean McGlinchey is also a committee member of St Canices Wellbeing Group. Welcoming the addition of the group to the community, he said no matter the issue, big or small, he would encourage anyone who is in need of support or help to reach out. “I would very much welcome this group which I would stress is for all sections of the community. It will be all confidential and I am confident it will provide a much needed service in the community,” he said. “Many people are facing uncertain times ahead with furlough ending and the possibility of people facing unemployment and this will have an impact on peoples mental health so this is a service that we need.” Just one of the services St Canices Wellbeing Group are offering is free CPR and Defibrillator training. The course, which will teach lesaving skills, will be held in St Canices GAC main hall every Thursday from October . “There are defibrillators all around the town and many of us wouldnt know what to do in an emergency or provide basic CPR so we have decided to hold this training,” Kieran McKeever explained. “The CPR and defibrillator training is open to everyone, you dont have to associated with any of the sports clubs however we would advise booking as we can only accommodate ten people per week however we intend to run the course until demand is met.” Participants will receive a certicate on completion of the course. To express an interest or to book your slot, please private mail the clubs Facebook page or text    .

Stephen Jones, who works for Climate Northern Ireland, will be among  delegates from  countries taking part in a six-week online policy and leadership programme and will gain exclusive access to policy experts and training, discuss policy ideas with UK Parliamentarians and Government and be mentored by UK think tanks and other senior leaders. googletag.cmd.push In partnership with the prestigious Moslashller Institute at Cambridge University, Future Leaders Connect aims to help delegates develop their skills, expand their networks and ultimately, make policy change. Stephen , who originally went toLimavadyGrammar School, was selected from over , applicants worldwide and as part of the process, had to pitch his global policy vision – choosing to focus on climate action. He has over seven years experience co-ordinating climate change adaptation in Northern Ireland, holds an MSc from Queens University Belfast and has experience as a Red Cross Volunteer on the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme. Speaking ahead of the programme, he said: “I applied to Future Leaders Connect to educate myself on how to make the biggest impact with good policy. This is especially important in the s, at a time when the stakes of making good decisions are higher than ever before. I also wanted to bring my own experience of supporting organisations to plan for climate impacts, to work with folks from around the world, and to raise the profile of climate resilience. “Following the programme,I plan to raise the issue of climate impacts up the agenda this year and I will be running a session at the COP summit in Glasgow in November to do just that.     It is also important that we get good climate change legislation in Northern Ireland, as we are the last place in the UK and Ireland to get it, so I hope to be able to better engage with this process.” Speaking further about his policy vision he said: “Evenwe stop all greenhouse gasemissions today, we have locked in changes to the climate system. These changes mean that natural weather extremes like flooding, heat and storms are becoming more intense and frequent, and on a huge scale. The means we require immediate action, so my policy vision is for resilience to climate change impacts to be given equal footing to cutting greenhouse gases. We have to do these two actions together. “This is not currently the case in Northern Ireland, or anywhere . I have been working on this professionally for more than seven years in Northern Ireland, but this is a global issue which is underdeveloped and needs support. It will be those least able to deal with the impacts who are at most risk.” For this Centenary year, the programme has been expanded in Northern Ireland to ten places instead of the usual two, through the support of the Northern Ireland Office, with Stephen joined on the programme by nine other delegates from Northern Ireland. Stephen Jones Across the six weeks they will connect with emerging leaders from Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, Poland, Ukraine, Vietnam and the rest of the UK. Congratulating Stephen and the nine other Northern Ireland participants, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis,said:“I’m proud that the Northern Ireland Office is supporting the expansion of the programmethis Centenary year, meaning more young people from Northern Ireland will be taking part. “It’s a fantastic opportunity for them to hear from leaders around the world and learn how governments can work together to tackle the great global issues of the day. Also speaking about the programme,Jonathan Stewart, Director, British Council Northern Irelandsaid: “We’re delighted to be able to announce the ten exceptional iniduals from Northern Ireland taking part in this year’s global programme. Future Leaders Connect is an opportunity for emerging leaders in Northern Ireland to collaborate with their counterparts from all over the world, and to benefit from the sharing of ideas and knowledge in tackling global issues and challenges. “The application process was extremely competitive, and we are certain that our ten young leaders whose backgrounds range from law and politics to housing and the environment, will make positive changes in Northern Ireland. We wish them every success in the programme.” This year’s Future Leaders Connect programme officially kicked off yesterdayand will run for six weeks online until November .

Monny McSorleywas just  years old when she passed away in April , after suffering a heart attack. The grandmother was just weeks away from her th birthday. googletag.cmd.push Last month her four daughters Ciara, Carla, Aileen and Erin and husband Eamon organised a  hour walk at Watty Graham GAC. The walk, which saw each of the girls clock , steps each, raised pound, for BHF NI research. Monny’s daughter Carla said: “We have been blown away by people’s kindness. The people inMagheraand at Watty Graham’s GAC really went above and beyond in supporting the event and supporting us. We will be forever in each of your debt and you have our sincere thanks. Special thanks to Watty Grahams GAC for all their help in making the walk a possibility. Thanks also to the support of local businesses Bitz and Pizza and Crawfords for providing refreshments and Tommie McGraths and Christie Print for their help with t-shirts and banners. “Thank you so much to every single person who joined us on the walk. Any time we even thought about having a rest, more people would come along and walk with us sharing memories of mammy and taking our minds off our sore feet. .     “We each had dferent moments when it got really tough, but luckily we had each other to provide encouragement and see us through the challenging parts. There were definitely some blisters and sore feet the day after, but it was all worth it for mammy.” Having lost their mum during the pandemic, this walk was very special for everyone who knew Monny. Carla said the walk provided them with a chance to connect with those who had been unable to attend her mothers funeral or wake due to the lockdown. “Mammy died when we had just entered our first strict lockdown here, so we weren’t able to have a normal wake or funeral, she said. The -hour walk gave us the chance to see those people who would have come along to the wake and funeral during normal times. It was unbelievable the amount of people who showed up to walk with us and donate to BHF NI,” she added. Monny was known and loved throughout her local community for her charity volunteering and fundraising work, as well as working closely with children with special educational needs. Monny McSorley Head of BHF NI, Fearghal McKinney said: “The staggering amount raised is a testament to the woman who Monny was, so well respected and loved in her community. With an initial target of just pound,, they really outdid themselves, raising pound, more than what they had initially aimed for. “We are extremely grateful for the support which the McSorley family and theMagheracommunity have given BHF NI. Choosing to support future heart research and indeed other people affected by heart disease through their event was an incredibly thoughtful thing for them to do, especially in the wake of losing someone so close to them. “We couldn’t fund our le-saving heart and circulatory disease research without the support of families like Monny’s. When the BHF was formed seven out of  people died from a heart attack but thanks to the power of research now seven out of  people survive. But sadly, like Monny’s story shows, that is still too many people dying far too soon and leaving behind a devastated family.

The Mayor of Derry City  Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, visited Mr McIntyre at his home to confirm the announcement where he welcomed the new initiative. Mayor Warke said: “Gay McIntyre is a jazz music phenomenon and has enjoyed a world renowned career performing as a saxophonist and clarinettist for more than seventy-five years, he said. “His career is all the more extraordinary given that he grew up in the city at a time when jazz music was an exception. “He was at the centre of the growth of the local jazz scene which has reached new levels over the last two decades through the festival which he was instrumental in establishing, so it is right and fitting that we honour and celebrate his contribution to the genre.     “He is a name that is known all over the world but his home town is where his heart is so the recognition means a lot to him and I hope it will inspire the next generation of musicians from the city to follow in his footsteps for years to come.” At the meeting Elected members approved a rates allocation of pound, for the  event which will be headlined by Imelda May in the Millennium Forum and Council Officers have been approved to move forward with planning.

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council voted earlier this year to hand control of Portstewart Town Hall back to its original owners - the Montagu Estate - after receiving Notice to Quit in . googletag.cmd.push Portstewart Community Associationhad called on the Department for Communities to intervene in the handover after a Public Records Office for Northern Irelanddocument appeared to cast doubt on the halls ownership arrangements. Under Section  of the Local Government Act, district councils must seek Ministerial approval for any disposal of land that is not at the best price or for the best rent. Department for Communities guidance says Section  also forms the basis for district councils to provide justication for a project and that the disposal is for the well-being of the district. However, a spokesperson for the Council said it does not consider Section  relevant on this occasion. Throughout Council’s long consideration of this matter legal advice confirmed that Council holds no title deeds for the building. The Montague Estate holds title, they said. Council’s Legal Team advised Council that the land in question is not registered in the Land Registry. Registry of Deeds searcheswere carried outfrom the s to present andhave no entries relating to the purchase of the Town Hall with a freehold title from the Montague Estate, . Council is aware of the PRONI document, but legal advice obtained and presented to Council advised that PRONI records are not proof of title and are only useful at providing general information.     It is possible any purchase price mentionedmay relate to a premium under a long lease. PRONI records also show Montague involvement with the Town Hall into the s. Council holds no title to the land and therefore Council does not consider Section  relevant as no transfer of land has taken place. The possibility of a community asset transfer to the people of Portstewart can only proceed with the agreement of the legal owner of the building, the Montague Estate. The community is free to engage with the Montague Estate regarding this matter. Last week, the Montagu Estate said they were disappointed years of neglect had resulted in the closure of the Town Hall. It is disappointing to us that the Town Hall has been allowed to fall into disrepair over so many years of neglect, causing the loss of this amenity to the townspeople of Portstewart that is sincerely felt by all, they said in a statement released by their solicitor. Local councillor Angela Mulholland confirmed the community had made contact with the Estate. Wehavereachedouttothe Montaguestatetotrytofind awaytoreachapositive resolution, she said. Wewanttorally thecommunitytoactively engageinrestoringourtown hallandtheotherareasthat have been left neglected for so long. Derry Now have contacted the Department for Communities for comment.  Montagu Estate disappointed with years of neglect at Co Derry town hall  The Montagu Estate have released a statement on the halls handover.    Council accused of failing to do due diligence over town hall handover  A local community association has called on the Department for Communities to intervene.    County Derry community group ‘deeply disappointed’ by town hall handover  The group also expressed frustration that meetings were held in private.

Council’s Legal Team advised Council that the land in question is not registered in the Land Registry. Registry of Deeds searcheswere carried outfrom the s to present andhave no entries relating to the purchase of the Town Hall with a freehold title from the Montague Estate, . Council is aware of the PRONI document, but legal advice obtained and presented to Council advised that PRONI records are not proof of title and are only useful at providing general information.     It is possible any purchase price mentionedmay relate to a premium under a long lease. PRONI records also show Montague involvement with the Town Hall into the s. Council holds no title to the land and therefore Council does not consider Section  relevant as no transfer of land has taken place. The possibility of a community asset transfer to the people of Portstewart can only proceed with the agreement of the legal owner of the building, the Montague Estate. The community is free to engage with the Montague Estate regarding this matter. Last week, the Montagu Estate said they were disappointed years of neglect had resulted in the closure of the Town Hall. It is disappointing to us that the Town Hall has been allowed to fall into disrepair over so many years of neglect, causing the loss of this amenity to the townspeople of Portstewart that is sincerely felt by all, they said in a statement released by their solicitor. Local councillor Angela Mulholland confirmed the community had made contact with the Estate. Wehavereachedouttothe Montaguestatetotrytofind awaytoreachapositive resolution, she said.

Rory Conway, of Roshure Road, Magherafelt, contested a charge of driving with excess alcohol on his breath at Magherafelt Magistrates Court last week. The court heard from a police constable who had attended a call from two female witnesses who had followed the defendant home along the Draperstown Road and Roshure Road on September  . googletag.cmd.push The constable told the court he spoke to the witnesses outside the property who said they had seen the defendant at a petrol station in Draperstown and observing he was driving all over the road, had followed him and called the police. After speaking with the witnesses, the constable located a car in the driveway of the house on Roshure Road, and noted the bonnet was still warm. Conways partner answered the door, and when askedthe owner of the vehicle was home, the defendant, who had been in bed, appeared downstairs. The constable noted a smell of intoxicating liquor from Conway and conducted a preliminary breath test, where a reading of mg was recorded. The defendant was then arrested and taken to custody and on leaving after police interview, said: “Boys, it would have been worseyoud got me in the car.” Defence for Conway argued that as the comment had not been taken down in the constables notebook and read and signed by the defendant, it was inadmissible in court. They also said there was no evidence of the defendant driving the car, as both his partner and father had access to it.     The constable said he was not aware of anyone  inside the property at the time, and that the witnesses had described a male suspect. Statements given by the witnesses were then partially read out in court by Judge Mullan. One witness said she had observed Conway getting out of the car and urinating against the garage, before she asked him: “What do you think youre doing ” The statement said the defendant replied “What ” and moved towards the car, prompting the witness to ask: “Where are you going  You nearly caused an accident there.” Conway replied “Im sorry, Im going to my bed,” before the witness went round the back of the house and observed him at the side window with no shirt on, looking out at them. Counsel for the defence said the details in the statement meant that the witnesses should have been able to identy the defendant as part of the Viper procedure, which they were unable to do. Summing up, they told the court the defendant had not been detected driving the vehicle, that his unsolicited comment had been inadmissible and that he had not been identied by witnesses. The prosecution submitted that Conway was the owner of the vehicle and that there were two witnesses to his driving who were so concerned they had followed him home. Police had found the bonnet of the car to be warm, had spoken to the defendant and noted there didnt appear to be anyone  in the house. It was also noted Conway did not deny the charge at interview. Judge Mullan found the defendant guilty of driving with excess alcohol on his breath, and said the failure of the defence to call Conway to give evidence was a factor in the decision. She disqualied the defendant from driving for a period of  months, and issued a fine of pound, alongside an offenders levy of pound.

Rory Conway, of Roshure Road, Magherafelt, contested a charge of driving with excess alcohol on his breath at Magherafelt Magistrates Court last week. The court heard from a police constable who had attended a call from two female witnesses who had followed the defendant home along the Draperstown Road and Roshure Road on September  . googletag.cmd.push The constable told the court he spoke to the witnesses outside the property who said they had seen the defendant at a petrol station in Draperstown and observing he was driving all over the road, had followed him and called the police. After speaking with the witnesses, the constable located a car in the driveway of the house on Roshure Road, and noted the bonnet was still warm. Conways partner answered the door, and when askedthe owner of the vehicle was home, the defendant, who had been in bed, appeared downstairs. The constable noted a smell of intoxicating liquor from Conway and conducted a preliminary breath test, where a reading of mg was recorded. The defendant was then arrested and taken to custody and on leaving after police interview, said: “Boys, it would have been worseyoud got me in the car.” Defence for Conway argued that as the comment had not been taken down in the constables notebook and read and signed by the defendant, it was inadmissible in court. They also said there was no evidence of the defendant driving the car, as both his partner and father had access to it.     The constable said he was not aware of anyone  inside the property at the time, and that the witnesses had described a male suspect. Statements given by the witnesses were then partially read out in court by Judge Mullan. One witness said she had observed Conway getting out of the car and urinating against the garage, before she asked him: “What do you think youre doing ” The statement said the defendant replied “What ” and moved towards the car, prompting the witness to ask: “Where are you going  You nearly caused an accident there.” Conway replied “Im sorry, Im going to my bed,” before the witness went round the back of the house and observed him at the side window with no shirt on, looking out at them. Counsel for the defence said the details in the statement meant that the witnesses should have been able to identy the defendant as part of the Viper procedure, which they were unable to do. Summing up, they told the court the defendant had not been detected driving the vehicle, that his unsolicited comment had been inadmissible and that he had not been identied by witnesses. The prosecution submitted that Conway was the owner of the vehicle and that there were two witnesses to his driving who were so concerned they had followed him home. Police had found the bonnet of the car to be warm, had spoken to the defendant and noted there didnt appear to be anyone  in the house. It was also noted Conway did not deny the charge at interview. Judge Mullan found the defendant guilty of driving with excess alcohol on his breath, and said the failure of the defence to call Conway to give evidence was a factor in the decision. She disqualied the defendant from driving for a period of  months, and issued a fine of pound, alongside an offenders levy of pound.

With the next Assembly election only months away, the campaign rhetoric has already started – and turned sour – with unionists openly mooting exploiting a loophole that could deny Sinn Feacutein or the SDLP the First Minister role should either be the largest party in Stormont. googletag.cmd.push Cllr Harkin of People Before Profit, while angered by the political manoeuvring is not entirely surprised that there are those seeking to pushing the boundaries saying “democracy has always been a sham” at Stormont. He said: “The threat by the DUP, UUP and TUV to refuse a First Minister they dont agree with harks back to the worst of the sectarian unionist veto. “While its no surprise, it does expose the hypocrisy of parties with pretensions to upholding democracy. “This isnt just an insult to nationalists, it is an insult to everyone who believes in democracy. There is an ever increasing number of people who identy as neither unionist or nationalist. “We share the sense of outrage many people feel. The veto on democracy must go. “The Civil Rights movement arose as a people power challenge to a sectarian Stormont regime for basic democratic rights. “Every democratic demand for equality was resisted, often violently, by those prepared to determined to defend the status quo. “The new Stormont purports to be a democratic institution, however, it is anything but. State sectarianism is still embedded in the new Stormont political carve-up.     “In Stormont, establishment unionism and nationalism, dismissed workers rights, womens rights, LGBTQ rights, respect for the Irish language and racial equality for decades.“ “Political establishment parties have shted on some of these demands, certainly not all and not far enough, because of relentless people power campaigning. “But the kneejerk anti-democratic instincts of all the governing parties isnt far from the surface. “The shocking undemocratic treatment of the Black Lives Matter protests was greenlighted and subsequently rubber-stamped by all five of the Executive parties. “Democratic access to the right to choose  None of the five Executive parties are making a fuss about the continued denial of abortion services. “The whitewashed investigation of the ash for cash RHI scandal is another example of how the new Stormont regime has been prepared to trample on democracy. “The failure of the Stormont Executive to implement an anti-poverty strategy tramples on human rights and basic democracy. “The same applies to the refusal of the Executive to undo decades of undemocratic neglect of Derry and the North West thats evident in the failure to expand Magee, upgrade infrastructure or build adequate housing. “In the old and new Stormont, democracy has always been a sham. “Stormont has proved incapable of meeting the basic needs of the vast majority of people. Whether its an insulting pay offer for health heroes, doing nothing as people are pushed over a poverty clf edge or ensuring womens rights. “As with the Civil Rights movement of the s, people power will be the key to extending democracy and creating a more equal society.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsPolice launch murder investigation after County Derry fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Paul Lavilleand James Donaghy, MD of Donaghy Bros, at the awards.Local NewsCounty Derry electrical retailer collects top award in London overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMickey left memories that will be cherished forever overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Hollywood star Jamie Lee Curtis could be making an appearance at s Derry Halloween event to promote the final part of the Halloween film trilogyLocal NewsScream Queen Jamie Lee pencils in Derry Halloween date overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Seamus Crossan ran  miles in  hours to raise poundk for Belmont CottagesDerry NewsDerry man runs  miles in  hours to raise poundk for wheelchair accessible vehicle for Belmont Cottages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Damian Brown pictured with his father Sean Brown during his playing days with Bellaghy.Local NewsTributes paid to gentleman Damian overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry teenager bit officer on the leg and spat at police overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood, has accused the DUP of setting themselves on a destructive course of action designed to antagonise nationalistsLocal NewsEastwood: Unionist threat of blocking Nationalist First Minister is insulting and pathetic overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

With the next Assembly election only months away, the campaign rhetoric has already started – and turned sour – with unionists openly mooting exploiting a loophole that could deny Sinn Feacutein or the SDLP the First Minister role should either be the largest party in Stormont. googletag.cmd.push Cllr Harkin of People Before Profit, while angered by the political manoeuvring is not entirely surprised that there are those seeking to pushing the boundaries saying “democracy has always been a sham” at Stormont. He said: “The threat by the DUP, UUP and TUV to refuse a First Minister they dont agree with harks back to the worst of the sectarian unionist veto. “While its no surprise, it does expose the hypocrisy of parties with pretensions to upholding democracy. “This isnt just an insult to nationalists, it is an insult to everyone who believes in democracy. There is an ever increasing number of people who identy as neither unionist or nationalist. “We share the sense of outrage many people feel. The veto on democracy must go. “The Civil Rights movement arose as a people power challenge to a sectarian Stormont regime for basic democratic rights. “Every democratic demand for equality was resisted, often violently, by those prepared to determined to defend the status quo. “The new Stormont purports to be a democratic institution, however, it is anything but.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.         Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.         Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.”     For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsPolice launch murder investigation after County Derry fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Paul Lavilleand James Donaghy, MD of Donaghy Bros, at the awards.Local NewsCounty Derry electrical retailer collects top award in London overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMickey left memories that will be cherished forever overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The popular festival which usually takes place in Co. Clare every September, was cancelled for the second year in a row due to the pandemic. The cancellations were described as a devastating blow for local businesses as the event draws large crowds from all over Ireland, and abroad, to the North Clare town. googletag.cmd.push  Organisers decided to take the festival to Cabo Roig, a small town in the Alicante region, and despite the change in location, veteran matchmaker Willie Daly promises that love will definitely still be in the air. I dont know quite what to expect, but itll be wonderful to bring Lisdoonna over there. Id imagine the Spanish fellas, with their Latin blood, will be a bit more forward than the Irish lads. Irish lads tend to be shy, and only get going once theyve a rake of pints inside them.

at half time.Downpatrick were desperately unlucky not to find the back of the net just minutes into the second half,as McGrady ran clear of the defenders after a looping ball over the topseemed to have caught Clonduff napping.With lsquokeeper Gribben already off his line, he made the decision to challenge McGrady in an aerial dual that the Downpatrick number  managed to win.However, his slapped effort over the head of the Clonduff custodian clipped back off the post and backinto the possession of the grateful Yellas.A minute later and the Hoops were back threatening the opposition defence, but Clonduff held firm when Branniganrsquos lsquorsquo effort dropped into the danger zone.Barry OrsquoHagan punished the Hoops for not taking their chances as his free sailed over the bar, before Downpatrickrsquos Oran Cunningham saw his effort drt wide at the other end.Charlie Carr extended his sidersquos lead with his second point of the game, although Tim Prenter managed to keep the RGU in touch with a no-nonsense score.McConville restored the margin with a left footed strike before his free pushed his side further in front.Darren OrsquoHagan showed no signs of slowing down as he began bossing play with piercing runs and cute passing, allowing the Yellas to put a foothold on the game.Doherty saw his free drt wide off the mark before Close punished the Hoops with a finely taken point to close out the action before the second water-break.Downpatrick knew the clock was against them, but they werenrsquot quite at panic station yet, as Brannigan converted yet another free after teammate Sean Bell was fouled.Clonduff midfielder Ross Carr pointed immediately after before Brannigan once more replied with a free.However, Darren OrsquoHagan began the move that would decide the match, after a string of neat passes and clever off the ball movement allowed his brother Barry to nip in behind the Downpatrick defence before calmly slotting home into the bottom right corner.The now six-point advantage truly seemed to deflate the Downpatrick side who now knew it would take something very special to force extra-time.Despite a Brannigan free, McConville wrapped up the scoring with a lovely left footed strike to ensure it was his Clonduff outfit who would enter the semi-final draw.This signalled the end of the road for the Downpatrick men, who gave a great account of themselves in this yearrsquos competition.Downpatrick: J Deeny, E Rooney , A Doherty, R Murphy, S Bell, J Bell, C Doherty , D Turley, C McCarron, T Prenter , G Collins, C McGrady , J Brannigan , O Cunningham, C Mooney.Subs: T Smyth, P Turley, A Og Robinson, M Fitzpatrick, T Louden, T McNeill, N Cunningham, D Brannf, T Savage, C Boyd, R Og Quinn, C Farrell, G Trainor.Clonduff: P Gribben, J OrsquoHagan, D OrsquoHagan, T McEvoy, L Branagan, C Carr , J Gribben, R Carr, A Carr , T Close , P OrsquoHagan, B OrsquoHagan , A McConville , S McConville, E Brown.Subs: N Trainor, C Brown, R Brannigan, S McGreevy, P Lively, R Lively, T McGreevy, B McConville, P Wilson, J Boden, M McPolin, K OrsquoHagan, F McConville..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Co.jpg","title":"Co Down Rural Community opens new hub in Newcastle  ","story":"THE Co Down Rural Community Network has opened a new wellbeing hub in Newcastle.The new facility is intended to be a central point in the resort to make it easier for people to access information, advice and support and participate in activities to improve their mental and physical health and wellbeing.It will work with iniduals, community members, local groups, and multi-disciplinary teamsto identy community needs and facilitate better access to mental health and wellbeing training and resources.The opening of the new hub is the culmination of the Community Network working with local GPs and primary care teams and the wider community for over  years.Over the past three years, the network has linked up with the MDTs in the local primary care practices.The network has a team of social prescribers and an MDT coordinator who take referrals from GP practices, pharmacists and from other sources and find solutions for people who may be affected by physical limitations or mental health issues or who simply feel isolated in their own homes.This work has intensied during the Covid pandemic, making the opening of the hub even more timely.A total of  people have been referred by the local GPs and their teams to the Community Network since January this year in addition to the  clients that the Social Prescribing team have been working with since .Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairwoman Cathy Mason, who officially opened the news hub on Monday, has described it as a ldquogreat asset for the Community Network team and those who formerly operated a connect and chat service.ldquoGroups of all sorts now have a base to operate from in a beautul and peaceful location.

The project manager Mr Mike Gibb, said Delamont had always been his first option but he could no longer afford to wait on the council.Mr Gibbrsquos announcement dashes hopes that the centre, which is destined to become the largest owl and birds of prey rescue facility in Europe, would come to Killyleagh.Mr Gibb had entered negotiations with Down Council last year regarding the possible construction of the sanctuary at Delamont.But the project became the subject of controversial debates within the council chamber earlier this year amid accusations that council officials were dragging their heels about the proposal, leading Mr Gibb to look for alternative locations.CLOUGH ndash Residents opposing plans for the erection of a BT Cellnet mobile telephone mast in Clough have formed an action group to try and block the plan.At a meeting in the village on Monday, residents got together after they heard local environmentalist, Walter Graham, outlined the drawbacks and health risks associated with these masts.Plans for the -metre mast which,approved, will be sited within the Watsonrsquos filling station complex, were published several weeks ago andaccepted could be operating within months.Up to  residents gathered in the Old School House, just a stonersquos throw from the proposed site, to hear of the risks and implications these masts are believed to cause.Villagers heard how the transmitter could dominate the skyline, towering over homes, a primary school, petrol station and an old peoplersquos home.Claiming that scientists believed the growth of cancers were ldquospurred on by the transmitters, he said. ldquoIf this mast goes up my children are coming out of school, there is no way they will study in the shadow of that mast.

Three minutes later the visitors had their first effort when from Casey Courtneyrsquos long throw, Christopher McKay headed back to Courtney but his enterprising effort was wide.Villa should have been ahead in the th minute but Aaron Carberry produced an outstanding double save.The game was being played at a frantic pace with both midfields battling for supremacy with Jon Joe Sharvin and Darren McConnell linking to produce an outstanding pass for Jack Sharvin but his effort was well blocked.Soon afterwards there was almost a repeat with McConnell and Barry Walsh linking, and Jack Sharvin flashing the ball across the six yard box.Killyleagh were playing some neat football with Jonny Murray and Jon Joe Sharvin combining for Jamie Sharvin to almost thread it through for Declan McComiskey. There was time for Jamie Sharvin to stride forward and try a long range effort.The visitors have made an outstanding start to the season, reaching the quarter finals of the Steel Cup, and they knocked the ball about with confidence as they had their best spell of the game.A free kick from the impressive Arthurs was cleared for a corner in the th minute and then, six minutes later, first Jamie Sharvin blocked the effort from McKayrsquos knock down, and Jonny Murray cleared a clever short corner as Thomas Dickson prepared to strike.At the opposite end twice before the interval Jack Sharvin went close, first with a free kick on the far left and then he had an effort cleared off the line in the nd minute but in truth both teams were very evenly matched in the first half.Killyleagh took control in the second half with a midfield masterclass from Barry Walsh and Darren McConnell in particular, and McComiskey having a lot of joy down the left side. After  minutes they were awarded a penalty when Jack Sharvin was fouled in a clumsy challenge from Courtney inside the box.However, Sharvinrsquos spot kick was brilliantly saved by Andy Wallace.Four minutes later and Wallace produced heroics again, this time a save with his feet from Sam Carson after McComiskeyrsquos pace had again exposed Villa.The goal was coming, though, and it was goal of brilliance. Jack Sharvin curled the ball round his marker Hylands from the edge of the box and into the stanchion of the goal in the th minute.It was a goal worthy of winning any cup tie, at any level. For a long time it looked asit would.Killyleagh had half chances, after this, with Walsh again winning his midfield tussle with Dickson to set up Jon Joe Sharvin and then Jack Sharvin went even closer from brother Jamiersquos free kick. Villa had half chances too at the opposite end with Jake Wilson going close to an equaliser.Then came that dramatic finale. Wilson was presented with a second chance in the box after his initial effort was saved and he produced a stunning finish high into the net from a tight angle.Cue th minute pandemonium and it seemed the tie was set for extra time.But when the game was restarted Killyleagh won a corner and after two blocks at close range the ball was eventually scrambled over the line by Jon Joe Sharvin in the th minute.The huge crowd contained several former players from the first Killyleagh team to win the Border Cup in  and now Paul Sharvin will be hoping his team get a chance to match that Christmas glory.To reach the semi-finals, however, they must beat Crumlin United on November  ndash a chance to avenge an incredible - defeat when the teams last met in this competition exactly two yearsrsquo ago when Killyleagh tossed away a - half-time lead in the last nine minutes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Slieve.jpg","title":"Slieve Donard sold for £40m  ","story":"NEWCASTLErsquoS iconic Slieve Donard Resort and Spa has been sold in a poundm deal to American investors.Owned by the Hastings family since , the world famous five-star hotel has been acquired by US-based AJ Capital Partners which is planning a major upgrade.After weeks of speculation that the hotel had been sold, the news was finally confirmed last Thursday with the new owner a Nashville-headquartered real estate developer and hotel operator with more than  hotels across the US and Britain, including St Andrews in Scotland.Announcing that the Newcastle hotel has been acquired, AJ Capital also confirmed that renovation work is planned to start in October next year, with the work completed by the following spring.During the planned upgrade, the hotel will remain closed.Howard Hastings mdash the managing director of Hastings Hotels mdash described AJ Capital Partnersrsquos acquisition of the Slieve Donard Resort and Spa as ldquoencouraging news for hospitality and tourism in Northern Ireland.He said it also represented a boost for the burgeoning golf tourism industry which ldquohas been an important driver of local tourism in recent years and shows signicant growth potential in the future.Mr Hastings added: ldquoI have every confidence that AJ Capital Partners will be sympathetic to the heritage of the hotel and that, under their leadership, it will continue to flourish and maintain its reputation as an iconic destination in Northern Ireland.ldquoThis investment is a strong sign of confidence in the local market by a major international hotel operator with exciting ambitions for the Slieve Donard in the coming years.

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, itrsquos too hot for dogsrsquo paws.     bull Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.bull Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The process is known as appointing a ldquosupplier of last resort .Customers are not able to choose their new supplier, with Ofgem picking a company it deems capable of supplying additional customers ldquoas soon as possible.The watchdogrsquos safety net ensures customersrsquo energy supplies will not be disrupted and any credit balances will be protected. vw,vw,px, px\"ndash Do I need to do anything No. The best advice is to sit tight and wait for your new supplier to contact you to avoid problems with the switch and protect any credit balance yoursquove accumulated.You should, however, take a meter reading as it will be useful ndash but not essential ndash for when your new supplier contacts you.It is also wise to download or screenshot latest energy bills, current direct debit and credit amounts, and yearly usage. A failed firmrsquos website can go offline, so it is sensible to gather this information as quickly as possible.Those who already have a switch to a new firm in process will continue to be moved over.ndash Should I cancel my direct debit Ofgem advises that customers can cancel their direct debitthey want to. You will be able to set up a new direct debit with your new supplier.Pure Planet and Colorado Energy have ceased trading. Well now move you to a new supplier.While you wait for this to happen, heres what to do now ##https:t.co OKuvewjSc pic aOGCFwXUmdash ofgemOctober , ndash Will I be on a dferent contract with my new supplier Yes. Your contract with your old firm will end and your new supplier will put you on a special ldquodeemed contract ndash one you have not chosen.This contract will last for as long as you want it to.     ndash Will my bills go up Ofgem says it will ldquotry to get the best possible deal for youyoursquore in this situation but warns that deemed contracts can cost more because the supplier takes on more risk. For example, they might have to buy extra wholesale energy at short notice for new customers, so they charge more to make up for it.However, deemed contracts tend to be at the price cap, and the current spike in wholesale prices means firms are not currently offering any deals that are cheaper than this for new customers, so you are unlikely to save by switching.ndash When can I switch to another company or deal of my choice After the new supplier has taken over, customers are free to shop around, and are able to move where ndash or be switched to a cheaper tarf with the same supplier ndash without being charged exit fees.ndash Do companies want all these new customers Taking on new customers can be very expensive. Not only does the new supplier have to pay staff to manage the process, it also has to buy the energy that the new customers are expected to use in advance ndash up to a year ahead.According to some calculations it costs around pound, for every new household they take on.It also presents an administrative headache. A lot of the time the failed supplierrsquos computer system is not compatible with that of the new supplier, meaning details for thousands of customers may have to be entered manually.With the global price rise in gas pushing up costs to buy energy, we know this is a worrying time for many people and news of suppliers going out of business is unsettling.If a supplier exits the market, were making sure you are protected #https:t.co LtoJtsAN pic XLcPgwoNsLmdash ofgemSeptember , ndash Whatall suppliers refuse to take on new customers Ofgem tries to find a volunteer supplier to take on the failed companyrsquos customers. But technically it could force any supplier on the market to take them on.The regulator will avoid this as much as it can, because, in the worst case, the shock of extra costs could put the new supplier out of business, or make it harder for it to keep serving its existing customers.If no supplier of last resort can be found, Ofgem can turn to the Special Administration Regime.Although never used before, it lets Ofgem or the Business Secretary appoint an administrator to run the failed business until it can be sold, rescued, or its customers transferred where.That company can be given government grants or loans to allow it to keep the lights on for its customers..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: My energy firm has gone bust.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
