We laugh, we sing karaoke, we do a lot of cool things together like skiing and riding horses.’He also said in an interview with Sports Illustrated that he wanted to ‘break the ice’ between the United States and North Korea.The former NBA player has thus far made five trips to North Korea, the most recent of which was in June 2017 in which he insisted he was ‘trying to accomplish something that we both need\u0027.Rodman’s bond with Kim is so close that he will reportedly be at the upcoming June 12 summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, though the White House recently rebuked the notion that the retired NBA player should play a role in the high-level diplomatic talks between the United States and North Korea.

According to witness statements, after being woken by smoke alarms, a resident called the fire brigade just before 1am.Four fire engines arrived at the scene minutes later and as the crew dealt with the fire in the fridge freezer, flames began to grow in other areas of the kitchen and images revealed that it had spread to the cladding before the firefighters had even arrived.As the fire continued to spread, by 2am the London Fire Bridge had declared it a ‘major incident’ and at this point, around 40 fire engines were at the location or on their way. In addition to this, because of Grenfell Tower’s ‘stay put’ fire policy, many residents were told to remain in their flats by emergency services.The ‘stay put’ order was abandoned at just before 3am and 65 people were rescued from the building by firefighters, 144 managing to escape before the order was abandoned, but only 36 after. By 4:30am, the entire building was engulfed and the fire did not stop until 1am the next day.          Photo issued by the Grenfell Tower Inquiry of the kitchen in Flat 16 where the fire startedGrenfell Tower vigilWriting for the Evening Standard, Prime Minister Theresa May has revealed that she will ‘always regret’ not meeting the residents of Grenfell Tower after the disaster and made it clear the belief she ‘didn’t care’ was ‘never the case’.She continued: ‘What I did not do on that first visit was meet the residents and survivors who had escaped the blaze. But the residents of Grenfell Tower needed to know that those in power recognised and understood their despair.‘And I will always regret that by not meeting them that day, it seemed as though I didn’t care.’ The Grenfell Tower inquiry has been halted for a week so that memorials and vigils can take place to mark the anniversary.The North Kensington community will come together for a 24-hour vigil on the eve of the anniversary and at 1:30am BST on Thursday, June 14, the names of all the fire’s victims will be read out at St Clement’s church.At 12pm, survivors and the bereaved will also gather near Grenfell Tower for a minute’s silence, the tower being lit green alongside 12 other tower blocks in the area, from 12:54am, the time the fire is thought to have started and will be for the following four evenings.          The facade of the Grenfell Tower in London after a fire raced through the high-rise buildingGrenfell Tower documentaryBefore Grenfell: A Hidden History, which will air on BBC2 at 9pm on Wednesday, June 13, will reveal footage that tells the history of North Kensington, which has had problems with social inequality since the Victorian era.150 years ago, there was a literal wall in place in order to separate the rich and the poor, and residents who have lived in this area for their entire lives have experienced slum clearance and gentrification, as well as the house price boom.The BBC documentary will focus on these topics in addition to the building of the construction of Grenfell Tower in contrast to the attitude towards the W11 ‘golden postcode’, that attracts celebrities and millionaires.Channel 4 documentaryChannel 4 commissioned a 15-minute virtual reality film on Grenfell Tower, focusing on the residents of the building, produced by independent production company Parable and was premiered at Sheffield DocFest’s Alternative Realities exhibition on June 7.Grenfell: Our Home used interviews shot in stereoscopic 360 with animation designed by the Tony Award-winning 59 Productions to recreate the everyday lives of the residents.

She wants nurseries to teach children these basic skills if parents have failed to do so, to make sure they are ‘school ready’ by the age of five.But yesterday’s LSE study casts doubt over the abilities of nurseries to solve the issue when some children are simply being kept at home.It found almost one in five children delays taking up a free place in pre-school education – most of them from low-income families.Around one third of persistently poor children delays, compared to one sixth of their higher-income peers.The researchers found that persistently poor children are 13 percentage points less likely to attend for the full five terms of free pre-school education than children from higher-income families.Parents need to take mobile phones away from children at...Primary school bans shoes for pupils and teachers so they...Share this articlePersistently poor children were defined as who were eligible for the ‘pupil premium’ – a deprivation indicator – for all three years of early primary school.In addition, migrant children – those who speak English as an additional language – were nearly three times more likely not to take up their full five terms as their peers.The LSE researchers said the findings were worrying because nursery is a key component to bridging the gap in attainment between rich and poor children.Author Dr Tammy Campbell said: ‘Universally funded pre-school education is not, in fact, being accessed equally by all children.‘The families who are benefitting most from the policy are those who are already advantaged in many ways – while low-income children miss out.‘It’s time for a clear and transparent reassessment of the purpose of funding for the pre-school stage – looking properly at which children win under the current system, and at who misses out.’Since 2004, all three and four-year-olds have been allowed a free nursery place.In 2010 the entitlement rose from 12.5 to 15 hours a week and in 2013, free places were extended to two-year-olds from low-income families.In 2017, there was an additional expansion to 30 funded hours a week for three and four-year-olds with working parents.          Poorer parents are less likely to send their pre-school child to nursery even though it is free, according to research (stock image used)The paper, ‘“Universal” early education: who benefits?’, was funded by the Nuffield Foundation and is published in the British Educational Research Journal.It found the free places have been ‘disproportionately benefitting’ children from higher income families who ‘least need a head start’.It said: ‘With over £2,000 now allocated annually to each eligible child, these places have become the central initiative aimed at creating a more equitable start for children in England.‘This is especially true given the squeeze since 2010 on funding for other early childhood initiatives, including Sure Start children’s centres, as well as reductions in cash benefits for families with young children.’The researchers also examined whether the type of pre-school provision available locally makes a difference to take-up.They found that in areas where more children take their places in Sure Start centres, take-up was highest among all children – and the gap between low- and higher-income children much smaller.In contrast, areas with most pre-school places provided through the private sector have the largest gap in take-up between low- and higher-income families.The authors called on the government to re-think their policy to make sure more disadvantaged children benefitted from nurseries.It comes after education secretary Damian Hinds spoke of the tragedy of children turning up to school unable to understand basic commands.Studies have shown these children quickly fall behind and can underachieve for the rest of their lives.Earlier this year, Mr Hinds launched a series of initiatives targeted at disadvantaged families encouraging them to read to their children and sing nursery rhymes, in a bid to help them learn more vocabulary."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/21/4D24111300000578-0-image-m-61_1528747601388.jpg","title":"Midwives ordered not judge new mothers choose bottle feed","story":"    New mothers will no longer be made to feel guilty for not breastfeedingIn the past the college has championed the benefits of breastfeeding, urging its exclusive use for the first six months.Only a third of British mothers achieve this target, making for one of the lowest rates in the world.

A post on the school’s website said: ‘We’ve heard some of our children, including in Year 3, are playing a game online called Fortnite ... if your child is playing this game talk to them and make sure you know what they are doing.’It comes as MPs are considering introducing laws which could see companies fined for failing to police age restrictions.Girl, nine, is in rehab after becoming so addicted to...Push launched to ban \u0027addictive\u0027 ultra-popular video game...Share this articleLast night, Culture Secretary Matt Hancock’s Parliamentary Private Secretary Nigel Huddleston said he was ‘horrified’ to hear stories of children becoming addicted to the game. The MP for Mid Worcestershire admitted friends of his 12-year-old son spoke of ‘nothing else’, although his own child does not play. He said: ‘The Government is going to be making it increasingly difficult for children to see inappropriate content.’ Recent cases highlighted the game’s ‘addictive nature’ and ‘the extent to which it quickly impacts behaviour’, he added.During a game of Fortnite, players battle to survive on an island against strangers online – fighting and killing each other until one only person is left, hunting for weapons such as assault rifles along the way. It was given an age rating of 12 for ‘frequent scenes of mild violence’. Though the game is combat-focused, no blood is displayed on screen.          Parents report that Fortnite turns normally placid children into belligerent thugs obsessed with guns and killingOn Sunday, it emerged a girl, aged just nine, was in rehab after becoming so addicted that she would wet herself rather than leave the screen.Mr Huddleston described the situation as ‘horrifying’ and ‘horrendous’. He warned that developers of such video games must take responsibility for the potential impact of highly addictive content.Concerned parents have taken to forums such as Mumsnet to vent their fears. One mother wrote of her primary school age son: ‘Yesterday he saw a poster with a man and child in a swimming pool ... and commented that it would be a perfect shot to blow their heads off.’Another added that her son, aged nine, had become addicted and she had imposed a ban on the game after his ‘behaviour deteriorated massively’. She wrote: ‘It was awful to see how angry he was becoming ... I seriously wish I’d never let him on it.’Fortnite’s creators could not be reached for comment.Are you worried about the amount of time your children spend playing violent games like Fortnite? Email games@dailymail.co.uk  My boys wanted to play it rather than go on the beach in Barbados...By Beezy Marsh Our household is gripped by the Fortnite-mare, though I can’t recall the exact moment it began. But I can tell you, as a mum to a very tech-savvy 13-year-old boy and his inquisitive 11-year-old brother, once it had my children in its glittery, cartoon-like grasp, its effect has been very hard to control.I’m a very hands-on mother – running around the park, learning to ride horses with the kids and even bouncing on their trampoline on occasion.I have armed myself to the teeth with Nerf guns and foam bullets, built forts out of pillows and learned to karate chop like Jackie Chan for the sake of family togetherness.But one weekend not long after Christmas, all that changed. It wasn’t the fact that my children were getting too old for fun and outdoorsy games.No, it was the arrival on the screens of their computers and Playstation, of a game called Fortnite.I have always allowed them some screen time, though I prided myself on the fact that my oldest boy only got a phone for his 13th birthday a few months back. My husband took on the responsibility of monitoring content they have only ever had access to age-appropriate material – no 18 certificate, sweary, gory shoot-em-up games were ever allowed in our house.          Our household is gripped by the Fortnite-mare, though I can’t recall the exact moment it began says Beezy Marsh, pictured here with her 13-year-old son Idris TaylorSo, when my eldest came home from school and asked if he could get a new game, called Fortnite, because the other kids in his year were playing it together, I couldn’t really see the harm in it. Once it had passed the dad-security checks, it was downloaded on to my son’s computer and also on to the Playstation. Whereas some games cost upwards of £50, the big bonus here was that Fortnite was free! Great.One of our great family traditions on Friday nights after school is to sit and have a film together after dinner but with the prospect of Fortnite-play looming, both of my boys were adamant that they should be allowed to power up the Playstation when we got in.If I had been a bit firmer at the start, perhaps it might have stopped what was to come but I didn’t see the harm in them having a go they’d both worked hard that week. After an hour had elapsed, I went to have a look at what the kids were up to normally I could get away with maybe 20 minutes without some kind of fight breaking out between them, or a Nerf bullet whizzing past my ear, or a demand to go to the park or to the shops to buy sweets.But once they were plugged into Fortnite – with their headsets allowing them to speak to each other via their microphones – there was no shifting them.They were talking to each other in a bizarre language - “On me!” , “Where are we dropping, boys?”, “I got an AR”, “He got a legendary SCAR”. The last two, it turned out, were names for weapons.Did they want any pudding? I had got chocolate ice-cream, their favourite. There was no response. “Shall we go to Risky Reels or Tilted Towers?” asked Number One son.In the end I got two bowls of ice-cream and set them down in front of them. I watched them melt. My kids were stuck to that screen like glue and in the end, I had to shout at them and pull the plug out of the wall to get them off it. And that was just the start of the great Fortnite-mare. They’d get up ridiculously early on a school morning to play before I was out of bed they’d whine and moan to be allowed on after school and would sneak on when my back was turned if I refused.The guinea pig was forgotten, their chores were left undone and I found myself losing my temper with them because every time they were on it, they developed a total deafness to the world around them.And yet, there were positives: they could play with friends who lived miles away, there was no blood in the game, they got to be teddy bears or disco dancers (albeit gun-toting ones) and the graphics in the game were amazing to look at.However, for us, the low point came on a trip of a lifetime to Barbados at Easter when they wanted to stay in and play – you guessed it – Fortnite rather than go to the beach. We pulled the plug and started a slow process of rehabilitation card games, swimming together, actually talking to each other again.Since then, we have allowed them Fortnite at weekends only and during holidays but for a limited time. They know that we ultimately have control over it. And while they spent some Christmas pocket money buying V-bucks, the game’s currency, no amount of pester-power will persuade me to part with any more cash.My biggest hope is that like fidget spinners and slime before them, this craze will have had its day before the summer is out. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/21/4D1DB1EC00000578-0-image-m-11_1528663822726.jpg","title":"Teenage mothers likely early menopause new research reveals","story":"    A study found 43 per cent of women who had a child while under 20 also went through the menopause by the age of 45The research was based on the health histories of more than 1,000 women in the Canadian-led International Mobility in Ageing Study.Women from poorer countries including Brazil and Colombia also reported high rates of early natural menopause compared with those in wealthier nations such as Canada.Those who experienced trauma in childhood were around 56 per cent more likely to have an early menopause.\u0027We must right a historic wrong\u0027: Women forced to give up...A modern lullaby!

Sheeran\u0027s proposal is the latest in a string of developments at the star’s country estate, which has been dubbed Sheeranville by locals\u0027Indeed, his argument somewhat demonstrates why the applicant requires a private chapel for private non-denominational contemplation.\u0027He said claims that the chapel would be \u0027a blot on the landscape, destroying views\u0027 were not based on facts and \u0027discredit the high-quality architecture\u0027.He added that it is common for Suffolk churches to be located on the edge of or outside settlements.\u0027Often, but not entirely because of the 14th century post-plague relocations of villages, this relationship is strongly characteristic of the area,\u0027 he said.\u0027It is also the case that private chapels are generally sited away from their host houses for the purpose of providing a visible feature in the landscape encouraging the contemplation of the viewer.\u0027 The proposal is the latest in a string of developments at the star’s country estate, which has been dubbed Sheeranville by locals.Mr Sheeran has already built a treehouse with conical roofs on a raised platform, a 26ft by 26ft pod described by villagers as a ‘Hobbit Hole’, a hot tub, a covered swimming pool and a wildlife pond.He has also converted a barn into his own pub and recently got permission to build an underground cinema and music room.Mr Sheeran, who is said to be worth £40million, paid £895,000 for his large modern detached farmhouse in June 2012.It was revealed in January that he had also snapped up three other neighbouring houses and nearby farmland to create his own 16 acre estate. An expected decision date on the latest planning application is not available, the council\u0027s website said.    "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/08/4D21930200000578-0-image-m-22_1528788448498.jpg","title":"Toll booth benefits ancient Act Parliament listed 800 000","story":"    Maggie Taylor and Grahame Penny bought the historic bridge over the River Wye in 2012.

The MP for Mid Worcestershire admitted friends of his 12-year-old son spoke of ‘nothing else’, although his own child does not play. He said: ‘The Government is going to be making it increasingly difficult for children to see inappropriate content.’ Recent cases highlighted the game’s ‘addictive nature’ and ‘the extent to which it quickly impacts behaviour’, he added.During a game of Fortnite, players battle to survive on an island against strangers online – fighting and killing each other until one only person is left, hunting for weapons such as assault rifles along the way. It was given an age rating of 12 for ‘frequent scenes of mild violence’. Though the game is combat-focused, no blood is displayed on screen.

He warned that developers of such video games must take responsibility for the potential impact of highly addictive content.Concerned parents have taken to forums such as Mumsnet to vent their fears. One mother wrote of her primary school age son: ‘Yesterday he saw a poster with a man and child in a swimming pool ... and commented that it would be a perfect shot to blow their heads off.’Another added that her son, aged nine, had become addicted and she had imposed a ban on the game after his ‘behaviour deteriorated massively’.

Email games@dailymail.co.uk  My boys wanted to play it rather than go on the beach in Barbados...By Beezy Marsh Our household is gripped by the Fortnite-mare, though I can’t recall the exact moment it began. But I can tell you, as a mum to a very tech-savvy 13-year-old boy and his inquisitive 11-year-old brother, once it had my children in its glittery, cartoon-like grasp, its effect has been very hard to control.I’m a very hands-on mother – running around the park, learning to ride horses with the kids and even bouncing on their trampoline on occasion.I have armed myself to the teeth with Nerf guns and foam bullets, built forts out of pillows and learned to karate chop like Jackie Chan for the sake of family togetherness.But one weekend not long after Christmas, all that changed. It wasn’t the fact that my children were getting too old for fun and outdoorsy games.No, it was the arrival on the screens of their computers and Playstation, of a game called Fortnite.I have always allowed them some screen time, though I prided myself on the fact that my oldest boy only got a phone for his 13th birthday a few months back. My husband took on the responsibility of monitoring content they have only ever had access to age-appropriate material – no 18 certificate, sweary, gory shoot-em-up games were ever allowed in our house.          Our household is gripped by the Fortnite-mare, though I can’t recall the exact moment it began says Beezy Marsh, pictured here with her 13-year-old son Idris TaylorSo, when my eldest came home from school and asked if he could get a new game, called Fortnite, because the other kids in his year were playing it together, I couldn’t really see the harm in it. Once it had passed the dad-security checks, it was downloaded on to my son’s computer and also on to the Playstation. Whereas some games cost upwards of £50, the big bonus here was that Fortnite was free! Great.One of our great family traditions on Friday nights after school is to sit and have a film together after dinner but with the prospect of Fortnite-play looming, both of my boys were adamant that they should be allowed to power up the Playstation when we got in.If I had been a bit firmer at the start, perhaps it might have stopped what was to come but I didn’t see the harm in them having a go they’d both worked hard that week. After an hour had elapsed, I went to have a look at what the kids were up to normally I could get away with maybe 20 minutes without some kind of fight breaking out between them, or a Nerf bullet whizzing past my ear, or a demand to go to the park or to the shops to buy sweets.But once they were plugged into Fortnite – with their headsets allowing them to speak to each other via their microphones – there was no shifting them.They were talking to each other in a bizarre language - “On me!” , “Where are we dropping, boys?”, “I got an AR”, “He got a legendary SCAR”. The last two, it turned out, were names for weapons.Did they want any pudding? I had got chocolate ice-cream, their favourite. There was no response. “Shall we go to Risky Reels or Tilted Towers?” asked Number One son.In the end I got two bowls of ice-cream and set them down in front of them. I watched them melt. My kids were stuck to that screen like glue and in the end, I had to shout at them and pull the plug out of the wall to get them off it. And that was just the start of the great Fortnite-mare. They’d get up ridiculously early on a school morning to play before I was out of bed they’d whine and moan to be allowed on after school and would sneak on when my back was turned if I refused.The guinea pig was forgotten, their chores were left undone and I found myself losing my temper with them because every time they were on it, they developed a total deafness to the world around them.And yet, there were positives: they could play with friends who lived miles away, there was no blood in the game, they got to be teddy bears or disco dancers (albeit gun-toting ones) and the graphics in the game were amazing to look at.However, for us, the low point came on a trip of a lifetime to Barbados at Easter when they wanted to stay in and play – you guessed it – Fortnite rather than go to the beach. We pulled the plug and started a slow process of rehabilitation card games, swimming together, actually talking to each other again.Since then, we have allowed them Fortnite at weekends only and during holidays but for a limited time. They know that we ultimately have control over it. And while they spent some Christmas pocket money buying V-bucks, the game’s currency, no amount of pester-power will persuade me to part with any more cash.My biggest hope is that like fidget spinners and slime before them, this craze will have had its day before the summer is out. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/21/4D1DB1EC00000578-0-image-m-11_1528663822726.jpg","title":"Teenage mothers likely early menopause new research reveals","story":"    A study found 43 per cent of women who had a child while under 20 also went through the menopause by the age of 45The research was based on the health histories of more than 1,000 women in the Canadian-led International Mobility in Ageing Study.Women from poorer countries including Brazil and Colombia also reported high rates of early natural menopause compared with those in wealthier nations such as Canada.Those who experienced trauma in childhood were around 56 per cent more likely to have an early menopause.\u0027We must right a historic wrong\u0027: Women forced to give up...A modern lullaby!

Now, in the age of Trump, they’re haunted by decline. He talks about fame, his legacy – and Kanye WestShortly after meeting Ed Ruscha, in an office space deep within the bowels of the National Gallery, we’re confronted by a terrifying vision. It’s Donald Trump. And he’s naked.“Oh boy,” mutters the man JG Ballard once claimed had the “coolest gaze in American art”. He averts said gaze from the image in question – a book illustrated with Illma Gore’s grotesque depiction of the president, complete with fleshy rolls and tiny stubby penis – and shakes his head. “I think the art world’s still in shock by it, we’ve not had time to react yet,” he says. “We’re all sitting in an electric chair.” He grabs the sides of his seat and mimics a rush of high voltage, before laughing. Of course, you could argue that Ruscha commented on the Trump presidency back before Trump was even thinking of running for president. His Course of Empire series, which opens on Monday at the National Gallery, might not be directly about Trump or even politics (“That word can mean anything so I tend to dance away from it,” he notes). But it’s hard to view its depiction of the turbo-speed transformation of the modern United States without seeing it as a warning sign. The exhibition hangs Ruscha’s 1992 series Blue Collar – five black-and-white canvases featuring buildings in LA – above updated versions he made a decade or so later, this time in colour and with each location radically changed. The trade school is now surrounded by a barbed wire fence. The phone booth no longer has a reason to exist, so it doesn’t. The tool and die factory is now emblazoned with Korean-style calligraphy (Ruscha invented the meaningless typeface himself, speaking to global companies’ lack of transparency – what do they even do?). Logos have faded, fences corroded, and graffiti has sprung up. It’s the kind of transformation that has left many Americans feeling adrift. And it at least partly explains why so many chose to elect a president who claimed he could bring the old America back. That phrase could sum up the foreboding that lurks in Ruscha’s work, zen visions of the modern American west infused with a sense of impending apocalypse. Now 80, he’s a little unsteady on his feet but sharp as a tack. His photography and paintings have helped define modern America – its gas stations, corporate logos and prairies. But there’s often an unsettling undertow – as in his most famous work, The Los Angeles County Museum on Fire. Ruscha’s word paintings, in which pithy phrases are afforded the same towering scale as mountain ranges, can be many things: enigmatic, playful and sometimes seemingly plain dumb. But often they unnerve – Pay Nothing Until April The Music From the Balconies Nearby Was Overlaid by the Noise of Sporadic Acts of Violence. One series focuses on the simple phrase The End. Are we approaching it? Ruscha, pronounced roo-SHAY, was born in Nebraska, but grew up in Oklahoma. It took an On the Road-style drive to Los Angeles with his friend, the writer and musician Mason Williams, to awaken his artistic instinct. Over that 1,400-mile trip, in a car that used “as much oil as it did gasoline”, Ruscha found himself mesmerised by the utilitarian beauty of the remote gas stations dotted along the open landscape – he’d later produce his first artist’s book, 1963’s Twentysix Gasoline Stations, and his iconic Standard Station variations.While the gravitational pull of New York’s art scene was overwhelming, Ruscha’s inidualist streak nudged him towards LA. His preferred school, Artcenter, didn’t have a place for him, a setback that proved to be fortuitous. Artcenter had a strict dress code – “no facial hair, berets or bringing a bongo to class” – whereas Chouinard Art Institute, where he ended up, let students do “whatever you want”. Had he got into his favoured college, Ruscha may not have become one of America’s most renowned artists. “I might be designing the rear wheel of a Toyota instead,” he says. “Who knows?”Ruscha never considered art as a viable career and kept himself afloat painting signs and designing books. An early break came when he was included in the landmark 1962 pop art exhibition New Painting of Common Objects at the Pasadena Art Museum, alongside Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol. Ruscha knew Warhol: “They made fun of him, but he really saw the light ... a very pure light and he was able to grab it. His movies should be considered in the all-time pantheon of movie-making, but people in Hollywood would just say, ‘This guy’s a fake’ or ‘He’s putting us on.’ Maybe he was, but I found his ideas very profound.” One of Ruscha’s first sales was to Dennis Hopper, and the pair became friends. Did he encounter the actor’s dark side? “He had drug problems and explosive moments – none that I had to fully experience in the raw. I knew that he had periods of depression and he had lady problems” – he smiles at this euphemism. “He also had problems with a lot of people because he had ideas that he thought should be run his way. And I’m all for that.” At the National, Ruscha’s Course of Empire is displayed concurrently with the series that inspired it – Thomas Cole’s The Course of Empire, which depicts the rise and fall of a civilisation across five canvases. Although vastly different works, the two artists share many similarities. Both can be said to have reinvented the American landscape tradition (Cole was born in Bolton, Lancashire, in 1801, but moved to the States) both are obsessed with the passage of time, and both can be said to instil portent within their works. “His was driven purely by a hatred of the progress of mankind, clear-cutting forests, things we’ve all lived through for many years since his death,” says Ruscha. “If you were to go back, find the place that he set up his canvas for The Oxbow” – Cole’s 1836 masterpiece that warned of the folly of cultivating land – “then you’d be greatly shocked. I see all kinds of trouble in the world, but I think he would weep at the poetry of change.” If Cole issued alarms about the burgeoning expansion of the American empire, Ruscha’s work, which documented its glitzy Hollywood peak, now seems to be warning us that it’s concluding. Does he think it is? “It’s a knock on the door, isn’t it? It’s a tender reminder that we might be at the end of our Rome.” The hectic pace of change is equally apparent when looking at the art world’s transformation. Ruscha started out painting for “sport” – money didn’t enter into the equation. Now his paintings can fetch tens of million dollars. He seems bemused by this change of fortunes, although his faith in the quality of his work remains solid. “I’ve done things that I’ve felt were kissed by angels,” he says. “I’ve tried to open the gates of heaven, as all artists hope to. Whether we do or not is another matter.” I wonder how he views his influence – especially in mainstream pop culture where word art is everywhere, from memes to inspirational gift cards. On the day we meet, Kanye West has just released his album Ye, featuring a sleeve of the Wyoming mountains with the text “I hate being bipolar it’s awesome” scrawled over it. “Oh boy,” says Ruscha, reading the words aloud to himself. Does he see his influence in juxtapositions like this? “I think that could have come from anywhere,” he says, politely declining any connection. “All art comes out of other art, but I don’t see my influence that widely.” Is he disappointed by that? “Not at all. As a matter of fact, it kind of isolates me in a nice way.”Isolation suits Ruscha. He built a home in the Mojave desert several decades ago and still returns there when he needs space. “The constant reminder that there is very little change, even over 40 or 50 years, invigorates me,” he says. It also reassures him when faced with his many fears about modern life – the rise of robotics, the mining of our data, the blurring of truths. The accelerated culture he’s documented so perfectly is starting to leave him in the dust, he admits. “I come across people every so often who think, God, he doesn’t have an iPhone, that’s disgusting! He’s no patriot!” he says, laughing heartily. “But I didn’t have an interest in the internet and I still don’t. The way I look at it is – it’s too late to learn.” Looking at Course of Empire, you wonder if that’s true of all of us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bd8f7155d46f8014e4857b29d0118dc34140705/0_150_2644_1585/master/2644.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6258f95d237f68bd404b29db7f58ac6c","title":"frida kahlo making her self up review v and a london","story":"V\u0026ampA, LondonBy focusing on Kahlo’s life and her suffering rather than her art, this memorabilia-stuffed exhibition stifles her blazing visionary brillianceThis feels wrong. I am looking at Frida Kahlo’s prosthetic leg. There is a glamorous red boot on it. The matching boot is also in the display case, yet the woman who wore the leg and boots is long gone. She died in 1954, when she was 47. Would she want her artificial limb to outlive her like this?It’s true, she wore it bravely. Everything about Kahlo was courageous. She was a revolutionary, a passionate lover, a bold artist. As a child she survived polio, then in 1925, when she was 18, she was in a bus crash that left her with lifelong disability and pain. At the heart of the V\u0026ampA’s highly unusual and problematic retrospective is a shrine to that pain. There are corsets and body casts on which she painted the communist hammer and sickle medicines and painkillers, crutches and built-up shoes. However, there are simply not enough of her compelling works of art.Kahlo was, as this exhibition reveals with sensationalist clarity, someone who suffered. Yet she was also someone who created. She did not endure her life. She transfigured it, into blazing, visionary paintings. These take a back seat at the V\u0026ampA to Kahlo’s clothes, makeup and iconic image. I suppose this is what artistic fame looks like in 2018. In her lifetime, Kahlo was much less renowned than her unfaithful husband Diego Rivera, who had known Picasso in Paris before returning to Mexico to create revolutionary murals. Today he is a lot less reverenced than her. (Even Jeremy Corbyn misspells the name of this once-lauded radical painter, calling him “Diego Viera”.) Yet it seems that in becoming globally popular, Kahlo has become an image, not an artist. Her creativity is treated here as almost incidental to her charismatic personality.Is that how it was always bound to end up? In the 80s, Kahlo’s paintings were rediscovered by feminists and collected by Madonna. Then, with weary sniffs, along came the art critics. Ask one of these characters, especially a male one, and he will mutter into his cravat that Kahlo’s paintings are really not very good at all. Crude, simplistic self-portraits. Were those critics right? Is it the biography that matters, after all? Or, to put it more fashionably and cleverly, was Kahlo’s life her real art all along? For this exhibition reinvents Kahlo as a 21st-century artist whose life was a kind of performance, whose self-fashioning was an act of creation and whose pill bottles are as significant as her drawings. When a sealed room in her house in Mexico City was opened in 2004 to reveal a treasure trove of her private belongings, from unseen photographs to well-preserved shawls and skirts, it was as if she’d been given a millennial makeover. An entirely new way of seeing her was revealed – and the curators of this show jump on it to discover a Frida who was the Grayson Perry of her day, inventing herself in an array of spectacular costumes. Her shawl gets a wall display to itself, her silver jewellery elicits gasps.Yet Kahlo did not see her art that way. Her work, for her, was what she made with pencil and brush. It was extremely close to her life, rooted in her life – but made magical by imagination. It becomes clear that this show has misread the connection between art and reality when it recreates one of her most powerful self-portraits as a fashion tableau. In 1939, Kahlo painted The Two Fridas, herself and her double, holding hands, with exposed hearts connected by a shared artery: one of the Fridas has cut the artery, spilling crimson blood on her white skirt. In this show two mannequins re-enact the scene dressed in Kahlo’s clothes. Yet this recreation is decorous and emotionless. There are no exposed hearts. There’s no blood on the immaculately conserved clothes.I simply disagree with the curators’ interpretation of Kahlo. She wouldn’t want us to be gawping at her possessions, however arresting they might be. She’d want us to be encountering her art – and it is well worth encountering. When we do get to see it, the emotional revelation is on a different level. In her 1943 Self Portrait as a Tehuana, she wears a fantastical white headdress that surrounds her face as if she was the red centre of a radiating flower. Dark tendrils or hairs radiate like a spider web over the pearly satin. On her forehead is a miniature portrait of Rivera, the disloyal lover who is, literally, always on her mind.Nearby is the actual costume in the painting, or one very like it. This is a beautiful, spooky moment as the stuff of Kahlo’s life is displayed next to the art she made from it. Yet the painting is alive in a way the old clothes are not. Looking into the image that Kahlo painted of herself is like gazing into her soul, her being. When she translated her life into art she expressed something inward, mysterious. It’s fascinating to compare her few self-portraits in the exhibition with the many photographs of her on view. Kahlo, you realise, made herself less beautiful in her paintings than she was. She painted an inner self, not her exterior appearance. Her depictions of her accident and its lifelong consequences are equally metamorphosised in her painted and crayoned diary. She is a magic realist, portraying herself with a broken classical column for a spine in a surrealist art of decay and dissolution.Some of that is here, but not enough. Original drawings are fleshed out by facsimiles. There’s a facsimile of the diary, too. All the makeup is real, though. Tantalising glimpses of her artistic brilliance are overshadowed by her relics. She has passed into populist sainthood.It is like visiting an exhibition of a dead Aztec queen’s tomb treasures. This is an archaeological exhibit, not an artistic one.

She was hailed by Harold Pinter’s widow, the biographer Antonia Fraser, as a writer who embodies “those qualities of courage and outspokenness which Harold much admired”.An award-winning novelist – her 2004 debut Purple Hibiscus won the Commonwealth writers’ prize, Half of a Yellow Sun won her the Orange prize in 2006, and Americanah took the US National Book Critics Circle award in 2014 – Adichie is also known for her TED talks and essays. Her most recent book is Dear Ijeawele, or a Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions, which began as advice for a friend about how to raise her daughter as a feminist.Her 2013 TED talk, We Should All Be Feminists, was later published as a pamphlet and distributed to every 16-year-old in Sweden as part of a campaign by the Swedish Women’s Lobby. Audio from the talk was also sampled by Beyoncé in her song ***Flawless.The PEN Pinter prize is intended to honour a writer of “outstanding literary merit” who – in the words of Pinter’s speech on winning the Nobel prize in 2005 – casts an “unflinching, unswerving” gaze upon the world and shows a “fierce intellectual determination … to define the real truth of our lives and our societies”. Over the last decade, it has been won by writers including Margaret Atwood, Salman Rushdie and Tom Stoppard.“I admired Harold Pinter’s talent, his courage, his lucid dedication to telling his truth, and I am honoured to be given an award in his name,” said Adichie.Judges for the award praised Adichie’s “refusal to be deterred or detained by the categories of others”.“In this age of the privatised, marketised self, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is the exception who defies the rule,” said Maureen Freely, chair of trustees for English PEN. “Sophisticated beyond measure in her understanding of gender, race, and global inequality, she guides us through the revolving doors of identity politics, liberating us all.”Freely was joined on the judging panel by the writers Philippe Sands, Alex Clark and Inua Ellams, as well as Fraser.Adichie will be awarded the prize on 9 October, when she will also announce her co-winner, the 2018 International Writer of Courage. Adichie will choose an author “who is active in defence of freedom of expression, often at great risk to their own safety and liberty”.

The weakest outlook from the survey was reserved for the banking and finance industry, which recorded the worst outlook since the depths of the financial crisis almost a decade ago, suggesting job cuts may be on the way over the summer. The barometer of hiring sentiment comes as Britain’s factories unexpectedly recorded the sharpest drop in output for more than five years in April, amid falling demand for steel and electrical machinery. The figures are likely to stoke concerns the UK economy is reaching its lowest ebb since the Greek debt crisis of 2012, a year when George Osborne was booed at the London 2012 Paralympics as the coalition government pushed through austerity measures with damaging consequences for living standards. Official figures showed Britain fell into a double-dip recession in the first months of that year, although the downturn was later revised away to show growth was flat in hindsight.Although the situation does not appear to be as severe this year, forecasts issued by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research on Monday suggest the UK has done little to bounce back from heavy snowfall earlier in 2018, when the ”beast from the east” caused a sharp drop in output.Ministers are likely to be worried by the picture the figures paint for the state of the British industrial sector, with the steel industry facing mounting pressure from US import tariffs. Industry insiders fear the tariffs could rekindle the crisis of two years ago, when a glut of Chinese imports threatened to bankrupt British producers.They also show the UK’s trade position with the rest of the world deteriorated further in April. Britain’s trade in goods deficit, which is the difference between products sold abroad and imported to the UK, unexpectedly widened by about £2bn to reach £14bn – the biggest monthly gap since September 2016."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bc5615b977b25e5abe3648f7387debc3386463f/0_0_3506_2104/master/3506.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d46e78bcdc52a50a5f338400a061bc7b","title":"could berlin tegel airport be reborn as a nightclub","story":"Tegel airport is being eyed up as a new venue – but plans are meeting with ambivalence as clubbers see their subculture becoming more mainstreamBerlin’s clubbing scene has long taken a creative approach to issues of space, setting events in former power stations, drained swimming pools and public toilets. Now its main airport is joining the list of alternative venues.With Tegel airport set to close following the long-awaited opening of Berlin Brandenburg airport, currently scheduled for October 2020, plans are already being made for the next chapter in its history. Last month Berlin’s culture minister, Klaus Lederer, and Lutz Leichsenring of the Club Commission joined project planners for a tour of Tegel to imagine it reborn as a nightclub.Tegel’s air traffic control towers, expansive hangar and soundproof jet engine testing hall were highlighted as potential spaces for a mixture of temporary and permanent music venues for open-air festivals, studios and clubs. The vision for Tegel also includes new housing and a tech hub. “A whole new district of the city will be born,” says Daniel Bartsch, spokesman for Lederer. “I think Tegel will become a figurehead for the city’s modernity and ersity.”Leichsenring was especially enthusiastic about the possibilities of a basement space he was shown complete with metal pipes, machinery and a readymade industrial aesthetic: “It reminded me of the space underneath the swimming pool in Stattbad Wedding, a former club in Berlin.”Architecture is important to Berlin’s clubbing scene, Leichsenring says: “The Berlin scene doesn’t want anything too clean or chic. It focuses instead on the basics: having a good soundsystem and good bookings. And it is always good to have a building where you see the history when you walk in. Berlin clubs like to work with the shape and the soul of the building.”Situated 8km north-west of the city centre, Tegel’s site was originally used for rocket testing during the second world war and was set to be turned into allotments due to severe bomb damage. However, the first plane landed there in November 1948 after a runway was built in just 90 days to help support Tempelhof airport during the Berlin airlift, when Allied forces in the late 40s broke the Soviet blockade of west Berlin by airlifting goods in directly. It’s been the city’s key passenger airport since the 1970s. Tegel has been operating far longer than intended, though, with the Berlin-Brandenburg originally due to open in 2012. Technical issues, scandals and multiple delays in its construction have turned it into a running joke among Berliners, with a majority voting to keep Tegel open in a nonbinding referendum last year. Critics, however, argue Tegel’s concrete hexagonal terminal building and infrastructure are ill-equipped to meet the city’s growing number of air passengers.Clubbing has also changed a lot in recent decades, as the formerly countercultural scene has been subsumed into the city’s brand. “When the Club Commission was set up in 2000, the club scene was associated with drugs and criminals,” says Leichsenring. “Now it is widely accepted to be part of the DNA and appeal of the city.”He founded the Creative Footprint nonprofit organisation to research live music venues in the city and protect its nightlife from the increasing pressures of regulation, rising rents and property development. “It is very important that with Tegel we talk about building additional clubbing space for the city, and not somehow giving up what we already have,” he says. “Over the years many, many clubs have had to close.”Ben de Biel, a photographer and former club owner, laments the lack of suitable sites: “In the first few years after the wall fell there were so many empty spaces. The first club I opened was in 1991 in an illegally squatted set of flats. It was easy: we found a house, had a look around, broke in, changed the locks and then started a club. Today there is little affordable empty space for clubs left.”De Biel says Tegel’s remote location is less likely to be a drawback to clubbers than the process of its development. He can point to a number of clubs that have thrived outside the S-Bahn train line circling the city centre, but adds: “Normally the clubbing scene itself decides what could be an interesting or sexy site.”Sven von Thülen, DJ and co-writer of the Sound of Family, an oral history of the Berlin clubbing scene, is sceptical of the plans. “I cannot see people from Berlin actually going there,” says Thülen. “I can only see it being a tourist trap. “For a long time Berlin clubs were about reclaiming the city and revitalising forgotten spaces. They were developed from the bottom up … Tegel could be an interesting physical space but it would be a top-down development, a kind of sanitised place.”Considering the ongoing saga of the new Brandenburg airport, it is unlikely Berlin clubbers will get the chance to head to Tegel any time soon. Yet the ambivalence over the proposed club feels fitting in a city that has seen its clubbing subculture become mainstream and its previously squatted venues turn into prime real estate.Leichsenring is keen to ensure the Tegel redevelopment is an opportunity for smaller grassroots groups to develop organically. He envisages it as not only an open-air festival space, but a site for exhibitions, creative agencies, markets, recording studios and rehearsal rooms.“The clubbing scene in Berlin doesn’t need any more commercial spaces,” he says. “We need more accessible space for experimentation, for new sounds, and for communities. We don’t want one club where you can just drop 5,000 people in there at the weekend – we want lots of smaller creative cells, and these spaces don’t need lots of investment.“You basically just have to rip everything out of them and start the first party.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a55254d37da4340e737662f6fe79b23393d7886/0_195_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87b7e079810646a0e61b6fd47f378cbf","title":"housing true cost privatisation right to buy landlords","story":"Right to buy has been a success for landlords but a disaster for those most in need of a homeCouncil homes are being sold off far more quickly than new social homes are being built, a new report has warned. The research into the government’s right-to-buy scheme, by the Local Government Association, finds that this has been the case since 2012: at no point has the social housebuilding rate matched, or come close to matching, the rate at which homes are being sold.Right to buy was given a boost by the Conservatives after the 2010 election in an attempt to sell even more homes, since traditionally homeowners tend to vote Tory. In 2013, the then chancellor, George Osborne, announced the maximum discount available for those renting a council home in London would rise to £100,000. In effect he’d approved the asset-stripping of some of our most-needed council stock.Across the country, home ownership is in crisis, with renting exorbitantly expensive and young people especially – even those in professional jobs – being priced out of the market. Their earnings disappear into the pockets of private landlords, while the finances of local government are given a kicking.Council housing works because it pays for itself relatively quickly: the rent paid by tenants covers the building costs in the long term, and eventually makes a profit for the local authority, which continues to invest in the local area. The money continues to circulate within the community rather than simply boosting the profits of landlords.But with councils forced to sell to tenants through right to buy, then being obliged to give a chunk of the receipts straight to Whitehall, building becomes ever more difficult. And the property shortfall is expensive, as authorities struggle to house their homeless residents. Last year £8.4m was spent by 23 councils to rent 725 flats as temporary accommodation, the magazine Inside Housing found. A vast transfer of wealth has taken place from the public to the private sector, under the guise of helping the aspirational working class. Instead, we’ve just made it harder to provide housing for those most in need.The folly of right to buy echoes the mess that is Britain’s rail system. In the mid-90s, John Major – echoing Margaret Thatcher’s disdain for the state a decade earlier – believed that breaking up British Rail would create competition, and that competition would ensure greater services and be far more efficient than control by the bloated state. Instead, the cost of train travel has become exorbitant, the service appalling almost everywhere you attempt to travel, and the state is constantly required to intervene – either because a franchise has collapsed, in the case of the east coast mainline, or because the rail service has become chaotic, witness recent weeks in the north and the south-east.The long-term effects of privatising both rail and housing, aside from ensuring we live in a country of crumbling infrastructure (in contrast to mainland Europe), is one of diminished social and personal opportunities. Many people are unable to see friends and family as often as they’d like due to the cost of rail travel. Others are delaying having children, or wondering if they can afford them at all, since they cannot afford to buy a home and landlords can be hostile to children. Those with children are in no better position: well over 100,000 children are living in temporary accommodation, usually due to eviction.Right to buy was popular, but with 1.8m council homes having been sold off, there are now about 750,000 households paying far more than a local authority rent. Housing, not buying, should be a right – and available and affordable for all. Right to buy is devastating our housing system, just as rail privatisation has devastated our transport infrastructure. Privatisation rarely works: we need new ideas, and far more public ownership of housing, infrastructure and utilities, if we wish to provide for our citizens.• Dawn Foster is a regular contributor to the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17f2e4db831a6fd874ccc4c3ba548f61514d7f4e/0_161_3867_2320/master/3867.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99b749e6b6f88c2288ac497aa23ed3db","title":"internship placement chuka umunna economy young people","story":"Labour MP Chuka Umunna didn’t set out to cause controversy when he advertised a student placement role in his office. Until the advert was picked up by the Graduate Fog website, which campaigns for fair internships and better treatment of graduates by employers, nobody thought there would be an issue. After all, while it’s Labour party policy to ban unpaid internships, “placement schemes” are different. Aren’t they?The rationale seems to be that because such placements are part of a student’s education, they are different from internships and thus shouldn’t be subject to the same rules. Perhaps, in the best cases, placements can play the role that their advocates say they do. Making them unpaid, however, certainly puts temptation in an employer’s path.Ellen (not her real name), a 26-year-old from the north-east, says that her placement in a London gallery seemed to be little more than an attempt to sidestep the gallery’s “no unpaid interns” policy. “The work I was doing was pretty much what an intern would do, and everyone in the office referred to my placement as an internship and introduced me to people as ‘the intern’.”Advocates of placements say that they provide invaluable experience and access to industry, and so it’s not really “working for free”. This is what they said about internships for decades. Anyone who has spent time on the precariat rungs of the labour market is used to the pattern of excuses employers use to get out of paying you for work. “Think of the exposure!” “It will look great on your CV!” “It will be an amazing experience!” Yeah, well, none of those things pay the rent.Even these intangible benefits can be oversold. Ellen was told that, despite her placement experience, her master’s degree meant she was overqualified for the gallery’s apprentice programme. To make matters worse, some roles she could have applied for actively excluded people who had done placements or internships – ironically because of concerns about accessibility. “My whole degree I’d been told we had to be willing to work for free in the arts to have a chance at getting a job,” she said. “I’d taken on massive financial risk to do this placement unpaid, and now I was hearing that this experience, rather than helping, actually precluded me from being considered for even an entry-level role.”There is a pernicious assumption that careers in the media, arts or politics are desirable in their own right and so young people should have to demonstrate their commitment by giving their time for free. The arts in particular have a long history of extracting unpaid labour from idealistic young people. That such policies exclude those without the means to live without wages is obvious, and this is reflected in the lack of working-class representation in these sectors.Jason, an international relations graduate, told me that he used to want to pursue a career in politics, but he was “financially frozen out” because, at the time, the only options available were unpaid internships of between three and six months. His parents lived outside London and didn’t have the means to support him for that long, so he ended up abandoning his ambition entirely, and now works in an industry that has nothing to do with his degree.When he was applying for placements, the Brunel graduate Gavin Pearson told me: “I don’t think I’ve ever felt more like a ‘have-not’ in my life. Students who could afford unpaid placements not only got something I couldn’t achieve, but they could even apply for the paid ones that people like me needed to get.” Gavin was able to balance shift work around lectures during the regular academic year, but fitting in a full-time placement as well was simply untenable. “Food, rent and bills aren’t magically suspended for the duration of a placement, and there’s only so many hours in a week.”Dr Matt Lodder, a lecturer in art history and American studies at the University of Essex, says he is worried that the education sector is being incentivised to create more placements regardless of whether or not they are paid. “I’m really proud that we’ve helped students from what’s euphemistically called ‘non-traditional’ backgrounds get placements,” he said. But “if they’re unpaid, as many are, then they can become a burden rather than a benefit in the immediate term”.Lodder fears this may be causing a systemic problem. “Unpaid internships and placements can actually lower the need for certain kinds of institutions to hire people for exactly the kind of permanent entry-level jobs graduates are crying out for. The more universities help their students find unpaid placements, the fewer jobs there will be for recent graduates.”The issue is not just restricted to “passion” careers like the arts or politics. Employers are picking up the habit of classifying training and experience as a replacement for a proper wage, a worrying shift towards conceptualising the job itself as a product the employer sells to the grateful employee. We need to recognise this is the “paradox of thrift” in action.Economy-wide, our problem is that people don’t have enough money to spend. Everything you spend is someone else’s income, which they can then spend on goods and services to provide an income to others. While it’s cheaper to employ people for free, it also takes customers and demand out of the economy. Capitalism runs on sales, and you can’t sell things to people who haven’t got any money.We need to get out of the habit of coming up with elaborate arguments for not paying young people for the work they do, and get back to understanding the fundamental importance of wages. Even if they’re young, even if they’re learning things, even if you never used to pay people in that role, paying people for the work they do should be recognised as a fundamental rule of the workplace. No more excuses.• Phil McDuff writes on economics and social policy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea99ff68bb0e07368b9a088d38011b4d28ff45cc/0_132_3188_1913/master/3188.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e1f4773532f17da7d1dc4f8ed84cd61","title":"historic england top 10 coventry cathedral angel of the north sutton hoo","story":"Historic England announces list including Coventry Cathedral and Sutton HooCoventry Cathedral, the Angel of the North, Tate Modern and Sutton Hoo, the site of strange grassy mounds that revealed some of the greatest Anglo-Saxon treasures ever found, have all been named in a new top 10 of heritage sites.Historic England announced the list as part of a campaigning project called Irreplaceable: a History of England in 100 Places. It is broken down into various categories, with the 10 places for art, architecture and sculpture.All 10 have been selected by the BBC’s arts editor, Will Gompertz, from hundreds of nominations submitted by the public. There are two cathedrals on the list: St Paul’s in London and the Basil Spence-designed Coventry Cathedral, which was consecrated in 1962. The latter was a replacement for its 14th-century predecessor, which was destroyed by Luftwaffe bombs in 1940.Gompertz called Coventry Cathedral “a magnificent, optimistic and bold response to the horrors of war”. He said: “To create a modern and ambitious building dedicated to spiritual enrichment from the literal ashes of destruction was – and is – a sublime answer to brutality. It is a building born out of love and hope, made from the rubble of hate and despair.”Sutton Hoo is the oldest place on the list. The burial mounds were first excavated in 1939. They revealed a 27 metre-long wooden ship buried with extraordinary treasures that helped rewrite understanding of the Anglo-Saxons.The excavated objects are on display at the British Museum and the Sutton Hoo site, looked after by the National Trust. “To look at them is to reach back and see our past made real and vital,” said Gompertz.The newest place on the list is Tate Modern in London, which opened in 2000. Gompertz, who was director of Tate Media before joining the BBC, said he knew every inch of the building, the former Bankside power station.“It is a wonderful space to show art and to welcome audiences from across the globe to mingle and learn together,” he said. “It breathed new life into a rundown part of London and introduced the world to a new way of showing and enjoying art.”The other galleries on the list are the Barbara Hepworth museum and sculpture park in St Ives and Yorkshire Sculpture Park near Wakefield, praised by Gompertz as “without doubt, one of the finest examples of art in the landscape anywhere in the world”.Antony Gormley’s Angel of the North overlooking the A1 in Gateshead has become a popular national landmark since it was completed in 1998. Gompertz called it a powerful piece of contemporary sculpture that “excites, heralds and provokes”. He said: “It is so far removed from the typical ‘hero on a horse’ statues that are dotted across the country, invisible to all. Gormley’s artwork is as fresh as it is imposing.”Completing the new top 10 are Kelmscott Manor in Oxfordshire, once the country home of William Morris Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, one of England’s grandest stately homes and the Minack theatre in Cornwall.All of the 10 places, chosen to stimulate debate, will be explored in depth in episodes of a podcast series created for the project, free on iTunes and Soundcloud."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89e1a1812eee271383b0fb9c3de449aeed77424f/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdd1379d5737cf95b689bb82674c1e8a","title":"straight eye for the queer guy owen jones gets a much needed makeover","story":"Declared the ninth-worst-dressed man in the UK, Owen Jones has not found being gay equals having good fashion sense. Can the ’s style squad change things?The first time I went on the BBC’s Question Time, in February 2012, I wanted to make a decent impression. The fact that I looked like Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone wouldn’t play in my favour – on my Twitter feed, people regularly queried whether I was taking time off from my paper round when I appeared on TV. But my then flatmate Liam took pity, and promised to leave out a special, smart-looking shirt.I found it laid out for me in our flat, and felt much more confident when I put it on. Fashion was not my forte, but at least, I thought, I had made a real effort. There I was in Nottingham, with big political beasts including John Prescott and Ken Clarke on the panel with me and, for a change, I had made a concession to expectations. It went well. Afterwards I called Liam to thank him. “But Owen,” he protested, “you didn’t take the shirt, you took my girlfriend’s blouse.”It’s fair to say that clothes are not my thing. If you need evidence, here it is: in 2016, GQ magazine named me the ninth-worst-dressed man in Britain – worse than Chris Evans. Growing up closeted near the centre of Stockport, I did everything I could to blend in – a massive dollop of gel, hair combed forward, Kappa tracksuits before graduating to Ben Sherman shirts – then, with a hint of teenage rebellion, I bleached my hair and pierced my eyebrow. I looked like a boyband reject, basically. Unfortunately, when I came out at the age of 20 (originally as bisexual, ruining it for genuine bis by fuelling the whole “bi now gay later” shtick), I was not magically endowed with a set of gay skills such as “being spontaneously sassy” or “having a great wardrobe”. A female friend said to me: “Oh great, now we can go shopping together!” But I hate shopping. I have nightmares about shopping.Thirteen years later, watching the Netflix show Queer Eye is a joy: here’s a show in which five queer men come to the rescue of mostly straight men, who are often imprisoned by their unreconstructed masculinity and struggling to find genuine happiness as a consequence. They teach them how to cook, groom, do up their homes, talk about their feelings and, yes, dress. Before I watched the show – a reboot of the early-00s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy – I worried that it would reduce gay men to this season’s amusing must-have accessories. It always struck me when I was growing up that the portrayal of gay men on television was either as one-dimensional, desexualised camp clowns as the butt of jokes or as would-be sexual predators. But Queer Eye upends all this. I fell in love with the show, and every one of the fab five, instantly. One of my favourites is Jonathan Van Ness, a hairdresser who unashamedly embraces camp: an important role model for gay men who all too often fetishise being “straight acting” (as I once did) and can be horribly prejudiced to those deemed camp. I wish my younger self could have watched a show featuring gay men as superheroes, coming to help straight men struggling with their own heterosexuality.Frankly, though, I’m a proud queer man who needs as much assistance as any of the straight men in the show. I may no longer care about how “gay” I’m judged to be, but I have developed no interest in clothes whatsoever. That’s not uncommon, by the way, among people attracted to members of the same gender who depart from heterosexual norms. Gay, I’m afraid, is not a synonym for sharp dresser.So it was suggested to me by my colleagues that perhaps I could use some styling that there could be an afternoon at  HQ that would amount to straight eye for the queer guy. I was a little apprehensive. Spending an afternoon trying on clothes normally strikes me as about as enjoyable as a night out with Ukip’s youth wing. Fortunately, fashion queen Jess Cartner-Morley and stylist Helen Seamons could see I was nervous, and put me at ease.I turned up wearing a grey hoodie and jeans – standard – and worried they would have got in gold-lined Prada shirts. It wasn’t just the inevitable Twitter storm – CLOTHES LOVING SOCIALIST HYPOCRITE!!! – that I was worried about I also have an aversion to splashing out more than, say, £50 on a shirt. Anything more just seems like a surrender to rampant commercialism. Thankfully, they had thought about all that, and as I eyed up the clothes, I was reassured that none were more than a notch up from high-street prices. I was relieved that I could imagine myself wearing any of them – other than a bright pink Hawaiian shirt that was a bit midlife crisis.Wow, I thought after putting on the first set, I’m wearing clothes that actually fit, rather than throwing on some random crumpled shirt hidden under a generic grey jumper before debating a rightwing thinktanker on Sky News. Some of them I quite liked: a swanky green jacket and a navy blue suit that made me look almost respectable. The bright red T-shirt needs a contrast button, and one of the jacket and trouser combos made me look like a not-very-hench bouncer. Throughout, Helen kept skilfully adjusting the clothes, and jokey patter with her and Jess made an otherwise slightly absurd scenario tolerable. I’m not going to lie, though: it was not me.I guess my perspective on clothes has always been: this is really superficial why should anyone care when I go on TV I’m just trying to get my opinion across, how I look is irrelevant. But this is a bit naive. Perhaps it shouldn’t matter, but it does. Leftwingers are at an automatic disadvantage because they are arguing for a radical departure from the current order therefore, how they present themselves matters. Demanding a crackdown on tax avoidance while wearing a Che Guevara T-shirt will probably attract raised eyebrows more than anything else. It’s OK to look smart and rail against injustice. I’m told some revolutionary sects – such as Militant, of which my late father was a member – encouraged their members to avoid dressing like a radical. John Prescott, meanwhile, has talked of attending Oxford’s Ruskin College as a working-class trade unionist: “I remember our first lecture, all the middle-class guys turned up in their revolutionary gear, we turned up in our suits.”Last year, I did a photoshoot for GQ to accompany an interview: they didn’t tell me the suit they had asked me to wear was worth £1,000, but several rightwing blogs certainly found out. “Owen Jones discusses the ‘crisis of capitalism’ in a £1,000 jacket,” crowed the Spectator. But actually – even though I didn’t own the jacket – this patronises so many young working-class people who (unlike me) pride themselves on what they wear, and often save up for months to splash out on designer items.When my  colleagues asked me to do a photoshoot as a gay man who doesn’t exude style, I was a bit bemused. But, weirdly, I quite enjoyed wearing clothes that looked good and fit me. I doubt I will be crowned Britain’s most stylish man any time soon. But there’s nothing wrong with priding yourself on how you look it turns out it doesn’t make you some superficial bourgeois traitor. Don’t expect me to start embracing Gucci socialism, but maybe I’ll stop treating shopping as a slightly less enjoyable exercise than dental surgery. You can want to change the world without looking like a dishevelled paper boy.GQ were way harsh. Helen and I agree on that, looking through photos of pre-makeover Owen. He’s a good-looking man, he just needs sharpening up a bit. The logic behind his trademark shirt-and-jumper look is that instead of ironing a shirt he puts a jumper over the top to hide the creases. Often, part of the shirt collar is sticking up, or has got tucked inside the jumper, so you can tell he didn’t look in the mirror before going on camera. That tells you everything about what Owen thinks about clothes – he doesn’t.Owen looks relieved that the clothes Helen wants him to wear aren’t flamboyant. “A style overhaul isn’t about wearing lots of colour,” she explains. “In fact, keeping to a minimal palette will help you look sharp.” The idea is professional and presentable, rather than suited and booted. Black jeans that have faded to grey are swapped for dark Japanese-look denim. A smarter shoe takes a jeans-based outfit out of Student Union territory a smart bomber jacket pulls a look together in a way that Owen’s grey hoodie doesn’t. Detail is key: Helen turns up jeans, rolls up T-shirt sleeves, quietly but firmly warns him off lumpily stuffing pockets with phones and keys.I suspect fashion may never be a passion of Owen’s, but the reality of life in the public eye is that clothes are noticed, and judged, whether you like it or not. So it makes sense to try to control, or at least be aware of, the messages you are giving out. Our shoot is tightly sandwiched between speaking engagements – one about Erdoğan, one about Gaza – but when Helen tells Owen the stores these clothes came from (Arket, Cos, new online brand FoR) he writes the names down on his phone for future reference, and I don’t think he’s just doing it to be polite. I don’t think we converted Owen to the fashion cause. But I hope we made him realise we’re not the enemy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fc8e9703cad3f214ff7e2281301f83ae87a7927/669_0_2859_1716/master/2859.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44d4b0b9a07aa969683ee6e6df78c316","title":"the incredibles 2 review pixar brad bird","story":"Elastigirl is thrust into the limelight while her husband plays daddy daycare, as Pixar slickly revisits the beloved superhero family after 14 yearsIt’s been nearly 14 years since Pixar’s The Incredibles raised the bar on superhero movies, but not a second of screen time passes between it and The Incredibles 2, which picks up the action so fluidly that a swiftly paced four-hour feature is only a splice away. But a lot has changed in that (real-life) time gap: the superhero mythos has been darkened, lightened, serialised and bundled into ubiquity. Now writer-director Brad Bird faces the Ayn Rand-esque threat posed by Syndrome, the imposter villain of the first one: “When everyone’s super, no one will be.”The decision to begin The Incredibles 2 at the end of The Incredibles is the most conservative choice possible for a company looking to cash in on one of its biggest hits. It also happens to be right. Bird gets the freedom to put his head down and send his characters on a new adventure without having to worry about where they belong in the DC and Marvel universes, or which themes and moods might be en vogue. There are plenty of signs of modernity here, including stunning advances in Pixar’s photorealistic backdrops and an electronic menace tailored for the smartphone age, but Bird has reason to feel confident that his family of superheroes doesn’t need to be reinvented. Like all families, they’re a perpetual work in progress. Not that every idea is a novel one. There’s no more exhausted concept than a society that rejects superheroes for doing more harm than good, and no easier sentiment than deriding politicians for not understanding “people who do right”. But The Incredibles 2 opens with a fresh reminder that the specials are not always appreciated, especially when a mission like stopping the Underminer (John Ratzenberger) causes far more damage to public property – a monorail that flies off the track, a collapsed bridge, a giant drill-bit boring into city hall – than the money in a bank vault could cover. The supers remain illegal, leaving Mr Incredible (Craig T Nelson), Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), and their three precocious children homeless, jobless and living out of a motel room, resigned to a future of more white-collar drudgery as Bob and Helen Parr. It isn’t long before a new opportunity arises, and the film finds its groove. A glad-handing telecom billionaire (Bob Odenkirk) and his tech-savvy sister (Catherine Keener) believe that superheroes are a benefit to society and put their vast resources behind Elastigirl as the face of a PR revival. While she thrives in the role, Mr Incredible plays Mr Mom in a gadget-filled mansion on loan, haplessly juggling lovelorn 14-year-old Violet (Sarah Vowell), 10-year-old troublemaker Dash (Huckleberry Milner), and baby Jack-Jack, who has about a dozen unmanageable superpowers. The entire family gets called into action against Screenslaver, a mysterious and untraceable danger that hypnotises and controls the masses through TVs, teleprompters and any other monitor in the room. Bird teases out some provocative ideas, like having the Parrs fight over dinner about whether it’s OK to break unjust laws to fix them or suggesting that society’s addiction to screens is a ticket to mind-rotting conformity. But mostly the abundant pleasures of The Incredibles 2 are simpler and more visceral, like the slapstick delight of Jack-Jack fighting with a raccoon. (The introduction of new Z-grade heroes – like Reflux, an old man with corrosive stomach acid, and Crusher, a burly dope who can crumple but not un-crumple – adds more variety and comedy to the mix.) Compared to the CGI chaos that tends to engulf DCEU and MCU movies, especially in crossover teamups, the clean zip of Pixar animation feels exhilaratingly rare, like a lost language rediscovered.With the peerless Toy Story trilogy as the obvious exception, most of Pixar’s worst films are sequels – Cars 2 and 3, Monsters University, Finding Dory – because they siphon off the originals without even attempting to match their audacity. The Incredibles 2 plays it straight, too, but Bird revivifies the expected elements, like the hilarious return of costume creator Edna Mode, and considers the family from a new angle. Mr Incredible and Elastigirl swapping gender roles is good for some fish-out-of-water laughs – his frustration over new elementary-school math techniques really hits home – but Bird seizes on a key insight: healthy families can reconstitute themselves and come out better for it. Healthy sequels can, too.

I’d had a lot of injuries that season, and in April I was selected for an England B game and Glenn Hoddle said: ‘I want to take you but you’ve not played enough games.’ I didn’t think I was going. Then he announced a 30-man squad with me in it, and we went to a training camp at La Manga. Every session you’re trying to decipher what it means for your place in the squad.Eventually, those of us who made the 22 were told at the hotel, all at the same time. It quickly came out that Paul Gascoigne had been pretty unhappy at missing out, and that’s what people remember. We’d been together for a while and all of a sudden you’re losing some of your colleagues, and as pleased as you are that you’re not one of them, watching those guys head out the door, seeing their sadness, that wasn’t good for the group.I think what Gareth has done is much better. There’s people on standby but everybody knows where they stand. And I like his squad: I think England have always picked players for tournaments because of their reputation. This is the first time I’ve seen a squad genuinely picked on merit.In France we were in a hotel in the countryside. The facilities were fantastic and we had some things to do – a pool table, table tennis – but there’s only so much of that you can play. There are going to be periods of boredom. When you’ve got nothing to do you pick up a newspaper, and that’s when the media scrutiny hits you, and if there’s negative press the squad picks up on it pretty quickly. Gareth has been to tournaments, he’ll know that and he’ll put something in place to stop the boredom kicking in. I would have liked to go out on some trips, to get the players in a group together, away from the hotel. But then if results are bad everyone would have complained that the players were off doing that rather than concentrating on football.”Knocked out in quarter-finals“We had a strong team in Japan, built on a strong defence. The key was that we had played together for a long time. I knew Sol Campbell’s game, Sol knew Ashley Cole’s game, I knew Gary Neville’s game, or Danny Mills’s game. When you’ve got those relationships, it allows you to perform with confidence, and I think that’s what this England team is missing.There were a lot of injuries in the buildup – David Beckham was coming back from a metatarsal, Kieron Dyer and Steven Gerrard were in the squad despite existing injuries and replacements were flying in and out. I think if a player’s carrying an injury going into a tournament, they’re never going to get fit enough to come into the team and make a difference. Especially if it’s your star man, the attention it creates, especially if that player doesn’t play to his best, it has a negative impact on the squad. You want to get rid of all that razzmatazz – a player needs to have played at least a couple of games at the end of the season, and the manager needs to be strong enough to make that call.He doesn’t have to only pick players who are in form, though. You need people with international experience, who the manager trusts, but if you’ve got a few players on the fringes of the squad who were in form at the end of the season, they can make a difference.I have good memories of that World Cup. I think it was the most well-organised tournament I went to. There were some big distances to travel but the facilities were fantastic, the pitches were first class and I think every detail was taken care of perfectly. My family came out, and nobody had a murmur of complaint. Plus we beat Argentina. We were a long way from home but at a World Cup that doesn’t make a difference. You’re in your bubble. You could be on the moon and it wouldn’t make a difference.”Knocked out in quarter-finals“We were staying in Baden-Baden, and a lot of us had friends and relatives nearby. Seeing my mum and my then girlfriend, having my mates there – and to this day they say it was the best holiday they’ve ever had – was a nice escape. It felt good at the time. But the way the British media reported the fact that our families were out there and enjoying themselves, the way they blew everything out of proportion, I thought was out of order. My mum was having conversations with journalists, having meals with them – they were staying at the same hotel – but then these reporters were stabbing people in the back and sneaking secret cameras around. As players we didn’t like that, and maybe it distracted us.Since then the FA have gone down a different route. As a footballer you should be able to focus for a few weeks. I think if players want to see their wives or girlfriends and kids then that’s fine, but if it’s your mates, and your mates’ mates, that crosses the line a little bit. I think the ideal scenario would be for families to be nearby but in a more controlled environment, with the press kept away.Other than that I was pretty happy with everything off the pitch. I felt as a squad we did have togetherness and did mix together. On the pitch, though, there was a ide. You had your starting XI, everyone knew who was in it, and everybody else was made to feel very distant. I was on the bench with the likes of Michael Carrick and Wayne Bridge looking at Sven-Göran Eriksson and thinking: ‘This guy, no matter how bad we play, he’s never going to change his team.’If any player finds himself in that situation my advice would be: stay focused, because if you get past the quarter-finals, which we nearly did, that’s when injuries and suspensions kick in and you might be needed. But hopefully Gareth Southgate will make sure the ide between the first XI and everybody else never develops.”Knocked out in round of 16“We made two trips to Austria before the tournament, the first a couple of days after the FA Cup final – those of us who’d played at Wembley got two extra days off. So there wasn’t much of a break, and we were together a long time. Then we were stationed out on our own in South Africa, without any entertainment or interaction with the community, nothing to take your mind off football. Some kind of distraction is needed. Retrospectively, that is something I’d have changed, and I don’t think those mistakes will be made again. To get to the end of the season and go straight into a tournament was probably not the right thing, and Gareth Southgate has given the players some rest. You only need about five days. It’s a rest for the mind as much as anything, some time with your family before you go away.I’ve never been one to have families at tournaments. I find it a distraction. It’s a month out of your life, not an eternity. Families can fly in and out and I don’t mind that so much, but the idea of them being permanently around I find quite difficult. After 2006 we went from one extreme to the other, and the middle ground is where you want to be.Once the football starts, all eyes are on you and the scrutiny is intense. We started with a draw against the USA, and if your tournament begins poorly it can be hard to press the reset button and get the confidence flowing again. In 2010 that’s something we certainly didn’t manage. That will be one of Southgate’s big battles, trying to take all the nonsense away from the players, trying not to let any over-the-top negativity infiltrate the team. Once it seeps in unfortunately it does affect performances. At Euro 2004 we got a bit of momentum and had the feeling we could maybe win it. None of the other tournaments I was involved in was like that.”Knocked out in group stage“I remember when I found out I was going. The announcement was scheduled for about 12pm, and it was nearly then and I hadn’t heard anything. Then I got a text from the FA telling me what time to be at the airport, so I sent one back saying: ‘Am I in the squad then?’ And that’s how I found out, about 10 minutes before it went public.I was made up to be going. I felt that every time Roy Hodgson had called on me I’d produced, and I thought I was going to play a part in the World Cup. In the end I sat on the bench for all but the last three minutes of the Uruguay game. I wasn’t expecting to be in the starting XI but what baffled me was when we needed a goal I was kept on the bench. I was flying at that time and just desperate to get on.We pretty much knew the team and even if the lads had a bad game I don’t think he would have changed it much. That’s been an issue over the years – the team’s been based on names and not form. If I had one bit of advice for Gareth Southgate it would be: change the team, play the right team for every game.When we got to Rio we were staying in a really nice hotel but we just couldn’t leave it. We were in an amazing city but couldn’t see it. A few lads tried to go to the beach and apparently it was just chaos. That was hard at times. Then we had to travel an hour, sometimes more, to training. It wasn’t so far, it was just traffic. The police basically had to shut down Rio to get us there. Maybe a football complex would have been better, somewhere with space to go outside in your free time and training facilities.The way the FA look after the players is amazing. You get treated like kings. But the pressure from the media was something I was not ready for. It shocked me how intense that was and the pressure does creep in. I think the FA bow to the press far too much and if I were Southgate I’d be trying to change that. If damaging stories come out, try to keep the lads away from it and take the pressure off. I’m not saying they should have a drink – those days are gone – but get the players socialising, make sure they have a laugh and let friendships grow.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9ea0a5308e61d385d641aa80ef7cc14556d08f1/137_578_9404_5645/master/9404.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66caa5f307d17aa6adb2f34d5952888d","title":"world cup 2018 32 fans countries preview tournament russia","story":"Supporters from every country that qualified share their hopes and expectations for Russia 2018• Neutral’s choice: who are rest of the world supporting?Moscow can... surprise you every day. It’s an ideal city for sports fans as it has 11 professional football teams and four in the Russian Premier League. Expectations are pretty low for the hosts. Fans don’t consider Stanislav Cherchesov a good coach and we are worried about Russia’s inexperienced defence.Russia will... qualify from the group. But only if Cherchesov finds a way to get the best from a talented squad and understands how to defend without the retired Berezutski brothers. If Russia can avoid Spain in the first knockout match, there is a chance we can go even further.Keep an eye out for... Alexey Miranchuk, an intelligent player who can create the moments that matter. Striker Fyodor Smolov could have a decent tournament too. He wants to leave Krasnodar and move abroad, so he needs good performances this summer. Ilya SokolovThe general mood is... one of excitement. Egypt haven’t been at a World Cup since 1990, so we seem to have forgotten how to celebrate qualification. The streets are draped in red, white and black, and everyone has now become a football analyst. We should just be happy we are at the party.Egypt is... not Liverpool. Mo Salah reached the final of one major tournament this year, but no one seriously expects him to reach another. We just want to see our team play exciting football as representatives of Africa. I would be content if we can get out of the group.Look out for... Ahmed Hegazi and Ramadan Sobhi. Relegated with West Brom and Stoke this season, they will be keen to redeem themselves on the international stage. Legendary 45-year-old goalkeeper Essam El Hadari will hopefully fulfil his dream of captaining Egypt in a World Cup. Ahmed AlyThe country’s emotional state is... euphoric and anxious. Great things are expected. Businesses around Montevideo have decorated their offices in light blue colours and there are World Cup sweepstakes taking place everywhere.Uruguay has... A good chance. There’s a healthy mix of experienced professionals and promising young talents. Luis Suárez and Edinson Cavani carry most of the weight of expectation but we have a very united team and the country has a lot of faith in them.When I was younger... I promised myself that if I ever had a daughter, I would name her Celeste in honour of the national team. Last year Micaela Celeste was born. Natalia TassinoAllowing us to watch football was... about women finally achieving one of their demands. Next up we’ll be able to drive. It’s so amazing to finally see all this empowerment for girls in Saudi Arabia.The country is... very excited about taking part in the World Cup again. Twelve years is a long time to wait for another chance. The Saudi player I’m most excited by is... all of them. We don’t have any star players and go into the tournament with a group mentality. This unity will be the key if we are to go through. Saudi Arabia should be targeting... the heroics of USA 94. Reaching the second round in our first World Cup was incredible. The three group-stage exits that followed were so disappointing in comparison. Sarah AlgashgariThe World Cup... means a lot to us. We have a large population with a strong sense of identity and history, but as a footballing nation we are still relatively inexperienced. Young Iranians feel oppressed and isolated at home, while also constantly misunderstood and stereotyped around the world. Cheering on “Team Melli” is an opportunity to express ourselves. We will... go past our group for the first time. The superb talents of Sardar Azmoun, Alireza Jahanbakhsh, Saman Ghoddos and Masoud Shojaei should give us a chance. It’s hard to look beyond the 2-1 win over USA at France 98 as my favourite World Cup memory. There aren’t that many to choose from. Payam KalantarThe last time we qualified... I was 10 years old. Back in 1998 we were so close to progressing to the last 16, but Brazil somehow lost to Norway. I fancy our chances... against Portugal and Iran but Spain will be on their own planet. Making it out of the group would be a huge success, but not much of a surprise.Our key player will be... Hakim Ziyech, an attacking midfielder who plays for Ajax. Salim ChoudartThe mood is... uncertain. The joy of winning Euro 2016 is still there, giving us hope, but the fact that we just aren’t very good still doesn’t sit very well with many.The minimum expectation is... quarter-finals. Getting out of the group with Spain should be a given but I expect the team to buckle against Argentina or France, the most likely opponents in the quarter-finals.Our creative force in the national team should be... Bernardo Silva. Portugal have lacked a proper attacking playmaker since Deco retired. Ronaldo should play a massive part too, unless he’s fatigued after another long season. Joao MeloBrazil 2014 was... very disappointing. We’ve only just recovered but, if we start well this summer, the belief is La Roja will soon be back.It’s difficult to say... where Spain will end up in the World Cup. There are many wonderful teams and they all want their hands on the trophy. If players such as David Silva, Andrés Iniesta and Isco start on the front foot, we won’t be too far away. Javier PerezAustralia will... never again reach the heights of the performance in 2006, when we were spectacular in Germany. The aim this summer is to get through the group. If the team give their all we shouldn’t be too far away. France are the only team that look unbeatable.The beating heart of our midfield is... Aaron Mooy. His tactical and physical approach shouldn’t be underestimated. He is one of the main reasons Huddersfield remain a Premier League side. His craftsmanship in midfield won’t go unnoticed. James GoughQualifying was... a relief as it is never guaranteed. Our goal is to do better than last time. South Africa in 2010 was a real disappointment but we can definitely make the knockout stages this summer. Then we will probably be destroyed by Argentina.The man with the X-factor is... Christian Eriksen. He’s been on fire for our national team during qualification and inspires younger players such as Pione Sisto, Thomas Delaney and Andreas Christensen. Our team is based around these youngsters. Emil ChristensenThe only thing that can stop us is... overconfidence. We have huge talents but a lack of cohesion. The national team has not evolved as much as we should have since Euro 2016. Didier Deschamps did a very average job with our young players. There’s no real back up for Olivier Giroud our full-backs are not so good and we rely on inidual talents to win us games. I’m not sure if that’s enough to win the World Cup. I would be happy to reach... the semi-finals. Spain, Germany, Belgium and even Brazil look more organised than us. The player who excites me most is... Kylian Mbappé. He already has so much experience and can do a lot of damage with Ousmane Dembélé up front. Antoine Griezmann will be his usual threat. Thomas KamdemThe country is... feverish with anticipation. We’re ecstatic about our first World Cup appearance since 1982. The results are almost inconsequential. I just hope we avoid any embarrassments.Peruvians... Don’t follow rules easily. We work hard and never give up. We’re eternally optimistic.Our national side is... a scrappy team. There are no outstanding players, but Ricardo Gareca has moulded them into a tight, disciplined unit. We go into the tournament hoping for results against Australia and Denmark. France will prove too talented.Our strikers are... near the end of their careers. Paolo Guerrero and Jefferson Farfán can be a potent strike force if they click. Farfan has had a great season in Russia, while Guerrero needs to prove that he still has it after his recent suspension. At the back we rely a lot on centre-back Alberto “el mudo” Rodríguez. Miguel PayetThe mood is... cautiously optimistic, but I don’t think anyone is very reassured by how Argentina have been playing lately.My favourite thing about Argentinian football is... the fans. When I go to see La Albiceleste play, there are always a huge number of enthusiastic and friendly supporters.The most negative thing about the national team is... the high turnover of players and managers. José Pékerman was given far too little time. He would have developed a consistent and mature style of play eventually.I’ve never cheered so loudly as when... Argentina knocked England out on penalties in 1998 – although beating the Netherlands in the 2014 semi-finals came close.If we don’t win the tournament... I hope we bow out gracefully after some memorable performances. MariaMy first World Cup memory... is also my favourite one. Our brave team that lit up France 98 will always be the benchmark for any Croatia team. That was a big thing for an eight-year-old boy. Will we ever finish third again?We should aim for... the semi-finals. There is talent all over the squad, with Luka Modric, Ivan Rakitic, Dejan Lovren and Mario Mandzukic the big stars. If they stay fit, another World Cup adventure is very much on. Luka IvezicIf we can get a result against Argentina... you never know what will happen! We are typically optimistic. Iceland doesn’t do national pessimism.Keeping an eye on... Albert Gudmundsson. The winger hasn’t featured much for PSV this season, but he’s our only real alternative to Gylfi Sigurdsson. Tryggvi KristjanssonThe mood is... the usual clash of overblown optimism and deep pessimism. Some always choose to believe we are due an adventurous tournament, while others expect us to crash and burn. I fear it might be the latter.I’d be surprised... if we make the second round. We look unlikely to match Argentina and Croatia for quality, while Iceland’s resolve seems to surpass our own. Our key player is... Wilfred Ndidi. He is an efficient, unfussy footballer. If fully fit, he might earn himself a big move this summer. KiaThe streets of Brazil are... full of green, blue and yellow. Schools are letting students go to classes in their football kits, and classes are cancelled when Brazil are playing. This World Cup... means a lot to us. After all the recent political unrest, corruption and economic uncertainty, the Seleção is not just a team but a symbol of hope. The greatest thing about this team is... we do not depend on just one player. We have Neymar, Coutinho, Firminho, Marcelo, Fernandinho and Thiago Silva. We have a better team than the 1982 one, which was considered the best in our history. Brazilians are... expecting a reaction from the disastrous defeat to Germany four years ago. Every minute of this tournament will be watched. If there’s a ball rolling, we’ll be watching. Pedro Henrique HeinzenThe mood is... cautious. The national team is not in its best form and the toughness of the group also increases the uneasiness among the more skeptical fans. We want to be competitive. I hope we make it to the second round. Getting though such a difficult group will lift our players and we could go even further if confidence grows. Commitment and dedication is a must.The players carrying the hopes of a nations are... Bryan Ruiz, Joel Campbell and Oscar Duarte. If they play well, Costa Rica will have a chance against Switzerland and Serbia.We’ve come a long way since... missing out on the knockout stages of the 2002 World Cup on goal difference. I never though I’d see Costa Rica in a World Cup quarter-final, so the efforts of four years ago will be hard to match. Daniel VillaltaThe Serbia squad is... the most talented in years. Coach Mladen Krstajic has made a positive impression. We haven’t reached a World Cup since South Africa in 2010 and this team is seen as far more promising than the one eight years ago.We should... reach the knockout stages. We can get past Switzerland and Costa Rica, and go through with Brazil. That would likely see us face Germany in the second round. The journey will end there.What excites me most about the team is... the midfield. Luka Milivojevic and Nemanja Matic are already proven high-quality holding midfielders. Sergej Milinkovic-Savic has been one of the most dynamic young goalscoring midfielders in Europe, and Dusan Tadic was unplayable at times during World Cup qualification. Oskar The mood is... one of excitement. There is a real buzz among Switzerland fans. The dream is to reach the quarter-finals for only the fourth time. In the last two international tournaments we were agonisingly knocked out at the second round stage after an 118th-minute goal and a penalty shootout. This time we may have to overcome Germany in the first knockout stage, but we could do that on our day.My favourite player is... Xherdan Shaqiri. He grabbed a hat-trick at the last World Cup against Honduras and scored the goal of Euro 2016. Youngsters such as Manuel Akanji, Steven Zuber and Breel Embolo are continuing to show their promise as well. Nischal Schwager-PatelGermany’s problem in Euro 2016 was... the lack of cutting edge up front. Julian Draxler and Thomas Müller are too slow against faster full-backs. I’m hoping Timo Werner can step into Miroslav Klose’s shoes up front. Germany’s midfield and defence will continue to dominate possession and wear down opponents.If Germany play to their potential, they will... win the World Cup. France and Spain have a crazy amount of talent but Die Mannschaft will be tough to beat. The impact players to watch will be... Leon Goretzka, Timo Werner, Joshua Kimmich and Niklas Sule. I’m excited to see how the Bayern Munich players will gel with the other players. I would also love to be proved wrong about Marco Reus and see him emerge as the world class forward so many people claim he is. Gina MayaThe main concern for Mexico is... the coach. People are optimistic about us making it further than our usual second-round exit but Juan Carlos Osorio may cause us to fail miserably.Brazil 2014 was... a very good tournament for us. We were minutes away from beating the Netherlands in the knockout stages. Our main hope this time is PSV winger Hirving Lozano. I’m excited to see how this young talent will make a mark on the tournament. Joaquín SánchezPeople were far from optimistic...when we ended up in the same qualifying group as France and the Netherlands. It was nearly impossible to think we’d be going to Russia. Most of our experienced players retiring after Euro 2016 also darkened the mood. But a younger generation of players have performed above expectations and here we are.Our coach Jan Andersson has proved... a team without stars can still make a great impact. Former coach Erik Hamren centred Sweden’s whole gameplan around Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Andersson has been a lot braver and has been justly rewarded.We should... progress from the group with Germany. South Korea and Mexico should not be underestimated, but if we perform like we did in qualifying this could be a very memorable tournament.Look out for... Emil Forsberg and Victor Lindelof. An injury-free Forsberg is as close as we have to a superstar. He is expected to pull the strings in the final third. Lindelof may have had some difficulties adapting to the Premier League with Manchester United, but he is still young. In the national team he has captain Andreas Granqvist at the back to guide him. Morris AnderssonSouth Korea fans are... not very optimistic. We are in a tough group and are fearing the worst after the national team made hard work of qualifying. The country will be behind them, but they do not expect much. There is a lot of pressure on... Son Heung-min. Off the scale performances will be required from him. No one else can be relied upon to score the goals needed.My favourite World Cup memories revolve around... Park Ji Sung. I still remember the mood of the nation when his goal eliminated Portugal and sent South Korea through to the knockout stages in 2002. Jevon RyanWe have yet to see the best of our... golden generation. We have a number of great players who are hitting their peak at club level, but they have not yet convinced for the national team.I still have doubts over... Roberto Martínez. The coach hasn’t proved anything yet and has caused quite a stir by leaving one of our best players, Radja Nainggolan, at home.I hope we can make it past the... quarter-finals. It will be hard if we come up against Germany or Brazil. I also expect most of our injury-prone defenders such as Vincent Kompany, Thomas Vermaelen and Toby Alderweireld to have limped off by then. Our most enjoyable player is... Eden Hazard. I hope he has an inspired tournament and gets the best out of Michy Batshuayi up front. Joren PelfreneThe mood is... one of tired resignation. The realignment of English footballing ambition since the golden generation has been slow and pretty painful. The way we massively underestimated a passionate and well drilled Iceland team at Euro 2016 showed we hadn’t quite lost our flair for hubris just yet.My main hopes rest on... Gareth Southgate. He hasn’t seemed overawed yet and we have a bunch of exciting young players. With expectations curbed slightly, this might be the time for us to take our cue from other minnows in the competition and enjoy the ride whatever happens.The player I expect to shine is... Marcus Rashford. He’s going to be fresher than some of the others in the squad after José Mourinho’s man management last season. Raheem Sterling, Kyle Walker and John Stones should benefit from having been part of a Manchester City team that has enough confidence to take on the entire world – which is exactly what they will be doing in Russia. Jack RoeOur first World Cup qualification was... not for the faint-hearted. The last-minute goal that sent us to Russia at the expense of USA was just the last of many nervy moments in a hard-fought group. But it’s been like a carnival celebration ever since.Our expectations are... grounded. We’re conscious about the level of the other teams, but hope to show the world the qualities that got us here: intensity, rhythm and unity.We’ll be the team most likely to... finish games with 10 or nine men. Discipline is our biggest challenge and has been a contributing factor in our previous failures. The soul of our team is... Our captain Roman Torres. He is our leader. I also expect good performances from veterans Blas Perez and Gabriel Torres. Football in Panama is... not the main sport in the country, especially when I grew up. Baseball was and still is the crowd favourite.Getting through the group stages would... extend the carnival celebrations by another couple of months. Amir SanchezThe country is buzzing to have... reached our first finals since 2006. We were so disappointing 12 years ago, despite nearly getting something against Spain. One point against Saudi Arabia and Ukraine sealed our fate before the party had really started. We are... among the weaker nations in Russia. But, while we’re in a tough group, I know we can turn a few heads. I hope we can hold our heads high after the three group games and somehow manage to upset Belgium’s golden generation. Look out for... Naim Sliti, an attacking midfielder who should keep us ticking. Kerym BaccoucheMy favourite thing about Colombia is... the warmth of the people. People genuinely seem to care for you, despite the great difficulties the country is facing. We’re passionate and sometimes a bit overdramatic, but still fun!My first World Cup memory is all about... Carlos Valderrama. His goal against the UAE in Italia 90 meant we could celebrate our first ever World Cup victory. Freddy Rincón’s late equaliser against Germany in the same tournament, which helped us progress through the group, comes a close second.This summer we should... build on the successful 2014 tournament. The majority of the squad from that World Cup is still here and new talents such as Yerry Mina, Davinson Sánchez, José Izquierdo and Mateus Uribe should make us even stronger.I look forward to seeing... James Rodríguez scoring another of the most sublime goals in our short World Cup history. Pedro GalloThe mood is... nothing like the football fever that swept Japan in 1998, when we qualified for the first time. There have been too many setbacks since and people just aren’t that excited this time. The main reasons are Japan coach Vahid Halilhodzic being dismissed right before the tournament and the worrying dwindling popularity of our domestic league.Everything rests on... our match against Colombia on 19 June. The Japanese media expect a positive result will get more people excited about the World Cup.I hope we can... get out of the group. We have an experienced coach in Akira Nishino. He coached Gamba Osaka successfully for many years. We need the communication between the players and the coaching team to be spot on. A strong sense of solidarity is a must if we are to progress. I’m very excited to watch... Takashi Usami. He is becoming a leading midfielder of the national team and learned the ropes under Nishino at Gamba Osaka before moving to Fortuna Düsseldorf. Eiko YoshizumiThe mood in Poland is... quietly expectant. A fine qualifying campaign, backed up by some cleverly scheduled friendlies, ensured we were given a reasonably kind draw. But there’s no point getting carried away. We failed miserably at Euro 2012 when co-hosting, in a group which could not have been weaker.Reaching the knockout stages of Euro 2016... was a massive success. While we lacked a Plan B at times in that tournament, our first XI was a sound mixture of solidity and flair. Question marks hang over the form of key players from that tournament, as well as the suitability of the recently tested formation with three centre-backs. It’s hard not to get excited when... Robert Lewandowski is near a football. With Arek Milik’s injury problems, we’ll need him on top form in Russia. Kuba WitkowskiIn 2002... Senegal carried Africa’s hopes in Japan and South Korea, with all other African nations crashing out at the earliest opportunity. But for poor refereeing decisions, Bruno Metsu’s side would have progressed even further.Sixteen years later... our aim is to progress from the group and pursue the semi-final dream. Why not? Senegal will be one of the hardest working teams in Russia, and the refereeing will hopefully be a lot better than it was in 2002.The player I’m most excited about is... Sadio Mané. After a terrific season with Liverpool it’s time for Mané to shine on the biggest stage of all for his country.

Yup, it’s the day England flew out to Russia for the Ethics World Cup. What a time to be alive! The inanity is unavoidable – this is the World Cup – but in defence of this very likable England side and a more realistic media, there is none of the preposterous hubris of, say, 12 years ago.

He has pitched England as intrepid optimists who will do their best to entertain. “We ask people to pay a lot of money to watch football,” said Southgate, a veiled dig at that £3.50 increase in the cost of a TV licence. “In the end, we want to entertain where we possibly can. We hope we can send people to work the following day having enjoyed our matches. We know we are not the finished article, in fact we’re a long way from it, but I think people see signs of progress and enjoy watching us and the manner in which we try to play. We are seeing a team that is enjoying each other’s company, getting on well and is very proud to represent the nation.”England, as you’ll know if you have ingested your World Cup wallchart, start their tournament against Tunisia on Monday. They play Panama in their second group game and finish against Belgium, and heaven help everyone if they need a result from that game to qualify. Belgium, the dark horses who aren’t actually dark horses, continued their warm-up by tonking Costa Rica 4-1. Headlines of “HAZARD LIMPS OFF” were followed by a less exciting small print: “Hazard had nothing more serious than a dead leg and will be fine to haunt Phil Jones’s dreams for the next week or two.” “It’s nothing to worry about,” cooed Belgium manager Bobby M, showing a disappointing ignorance of how journalism works. “I really enjoyed his performance.

Updated advice from the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) stresses that new mothers should be given appropriate support if they make an informed decision to bottle-feed. The guidance still says babies should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life, in line with advice from the World Health Organization (WHO).But the RCM has acknowledged that some mothers struggle to start or carry on breastfeeding, and says the decision is a woman’s right. Its chief executive, Gill Walton, said: “Evidence clearly shows that breastfeeding in line with WHO guidance brings optimum benefits for the health of both mother and baby. However, the reality is that often some women for a variety of reasons struggle to start or sustain breastfeeding. “The RCM believes that women should be at the centre of their own care and as with other areas of maternity care, midwives and maternity support workers should promote informed choice. “If, after being given appropriate information, advice and support on breastfeeding, a woman chooses not to do so, or to give formula as well as breastfeeding, her choice must be respected.” The National Childbirth Trust has previously warned that women can face judgment or feel guilty about the decisions they make when it comes to feeding their baby. But the RCM said it recognised that “some women cannot or do not wish to breastfeed”. “They must be given all the advice and support they need on safe preparation of bottles and responsive feeding to develop a close and loving bond with their baby,” Walton added. “We know that every woman wants the best for her baby and we want to be able to empower our members to support women to be the best they can be and enable them to make decisions that are right for themselves and their babies.” The organisation also said that those who chose to breastfeed needed more support and should not feel “guilty or embarrassed” about breastfeeding in public. Research has found breastfeeding can have long-term health advantages, with children less likely to develop diabetes or become obese later in life.

Divide the potatoes between two plates then place about 150g of crème fraîche on top, letting it melt into the cracks and crevices of the broken potatoes. Spoon the hot shallots over the top, then add the parsley and 50g of very finely sliced ham, such as jamon Iberico or San Daniele.The crème fraîche needs to melt and ooze into the potatoes, so dress them quickly, as soon as you have drained and crushed them. If the potatoes have cooled, then melt the crème fraîche in a shallow pan, add the cooked shallots and the parsley, and pour over the potatoes, tossing them gently in the sauce.You can use small carrots for this, crushing them lightly as you would the potatoes, and spooning thick yogurt over the top in place of the crème fraîche.

Meanwhile, make the shortbread: blitz the butter, flour and sugar in a food processor until the mix looks like fine breadcrumbs. Divide between two rectangular tins, roughly 10cm x 25cm, and press down firmly, then bake for 20 minutes, until golden. Set aside to cool completely.Make the base for the ice-cream: mix the double cream, milk, egg yolks and sugar in a saucepan, and cook over a medium heat. Use a balloon whisk to keep the mix moving constantly, and keep cooking for a few minutes until it thickens. Remove from the hob, stir in the mascarpone, vanilla and salt, and set aside to cool, giving it an occasional stir. Once cooled, put it in the fridge to chill for about two hours.Once chilled, put the mixture in the freezer drum of an ice-cream maker and churn until it starts to freeze. Once the ice-cream has frozen, transfer it to the chilled bowl. Break up half the shortbread into little chunks and stir it into the ice-cream cut the other half into wedges and set aside. Stir the jam into the ice-cream, one spoon at a time, taking care not to overmix it you want to see little ripples of jam throughout the ice-cream. Transfer the whole mix to a tub and pop it in the freezer.If you don’t have an ice-cream maker, pop the fridge-chilled mix into a tub and put it in the freezer. Remove at 25-minute intervals to give it a brief, vigorous stir, until the mix starts to freeze. Then freeze completely.To serve, scoop a portion of ice-cream into a bowl and serve with the shortbread, fresh strawberries and fresh mint leaves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c28f9d5ab388aed4316a7909a17ef87551f21307/395_141_2209_1325/master/2209.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e5ec172da978713667f664033078d27","title":"shakira review o2 arena london","story":"O2 Arena, LondonResurgent after re-embracing Spanish-language pop, the Colombian superstar still gives her all to her anglophone hitsThere is no shortage of alpha women filling the world’s big venues this summer. As Shakira arrives for her first British date since 2010, Taylor Swift, Katy Perry and Beyoncé (performing with Jay-Z) are in the UK this week, and Britney Spears is here in August. Of them all, though, only one gave a speech at the World Economic Forum last year, after receiving an award for her work on early childhood education.That’s not the only thing that distinguishes Shakira from her peers – the singer is a formative figure in the mainstreaming of Latin music, having paved the way for the current ubiquity of Luis Fonsi and her fellow Colombian J Balvin, whose success has, in turn, provided a launchpad for her comeback. Her years away from the live circuit have been consumed by child-rearing and relocation to Barcelona, the hometown of her partner, footballer Gerard Piqué. (Tonight, she turns her guitar to display a picture of Piqué and their children on the back – the pop equivalent of pulling photos out of her handbag.) A self-titled English-language album reached No 2 in the US in 2014 despite not being supported by a tour, but it was 2017’s mainly Spanish record El Dorado that marked the real start of her return.She can still fill arenas, although much of tonight’s crowd seem to be drawn from south London’s Colombian population, who vociferously welcome back-catalogue hits such as La Tortura and ¿Dónde Estás Corazón?. The setlist skews Spanish, and wisely so, given the reaction to songs such as Me Enamoré and her recent venture into reggaeton, Chantaje. If anything, English-language hits such as Hips Don’t Lie and her 2014 duet with Rihanna, Can’t Remember to Forget You, don’t excite quite the same joy and waving of Colombian flags as, say, the sentimental Antologia and Tú.Therein lies the question hovering over the El Dorado tour: can she emphasise her Latin identity by hitching herself to reggaeton and retain the English speakers who came aboard during the era of big pop hits like Hips Don’t Lie and She Wolf? Shakira certainly has a good go at it here. Her last major pop song was her Rihanna duet (which gets a novel twist tonight, with Shakira playing drums as footage of Rihanna appears on video screens), so the tour lacks the white heat that surrounds an artist on a hot streak, yet the set bubbles away at a tremendous pace.It’s apt that the second song tonight, She Wolf, begins with her straining against chains that shackle her wrists before bursting free – Shakira, fearless and frothy-maned, is positively lupine in her power and litheness. One moment she’s acting out standard arena rituals (asking the girls in the house to howl She Wolf’s chorus, demanding that the crowd roar the word “chantaje”) and the next she’s reinforcing her links to Colombia with a video depicting the mother goddess Bachué. Belly dancing, long a feature of her shows, is a tribute to her father’s Lebanese heritage, and an especially limber one at that, complete with gold death mask on the back of her head.“A few months ago, I didn’t think I’d ever play for you again,” she says, alluding to a vocal cord haemorrhage that forced the postponement of the tour’s opening dates. “But miracles do exist.”Long may she howl."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73ba7b16c26031756cdee5cd287e44d93f086a31/0_347_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fba4d6b2d9c6d192b39d641190b46dd","title":"the last bat the mystery of britains most solitary animal","story":"In a dank Sussex tunnel, a solitary greater mouse-eared bat roosts each winter. Is he the only one left in Britain? By  Patrick BarkhamWe cannot speak of its loneliness, but it must be Britain’s most solitary animal. For the last 16 years, every winter, a male greater mouse-eared bat has taken up residence 300 metres inside a disused and exceedingly damp railway tunnel in West Sussex. The greater mouse-eared bat has been all but extinct in this country for decades. This is the only remaining one we know of. The future of the species in Britain appears to rest with one long-lived and very distinctive inidual.The greater mouse-eared bat is so large that observers who first discovered it in Britain likened one to a young rabbit hanging from a wall. In flight, its wings can stretch to nearly half a metre – an astonishing spectacle in a land where bats are generally closer to the size of the rodent that inspired their old name: flittermouse.The bat has large, mouse-like ears and its feeding habits are as striking as its size. Rather than zig-zagging through darkening skies collecting flying insects, like most bats, Myotis myotis descends earthwards, flapping its wings very slowly as it covers the ground, picking up grasshoppers, crickets, dung beetles and other flightless insects as it goes. Often, it will flop on to the ground, wings outstretched to fold over its prey.The solitary inidual who spends the winters in West Sussex has never been observed in flight. Where it goes each spring is not known, and what it does is not known, nor which other animals, if any, it encounters. All that is known is that each winter the bat faithfully returns to its dark tunnel, where it hangs, almost motionless, for five months. This place of winter rest is a closely guarded secret, for the bat’s select band of self-appointed s are adamant: there can be no repeat of the scenes of 1957. That year, a live colony had been found inside an old mine on the Isle of Purbeck in Dorset. Although a reasonably familiar sight in southern Europe, where large colonies roost in caves, this was the first time a greater mouse-eared bat had been found in Britain. The Times published photographs, and a media frenzy ensued. Several animals were whisked out of hibernation and transported to TV and photographic studios and filmed for weeks before being returned to their hibernation hole. Disturbing bats mid-hibernation can kill them. Money was also offered for dead specimens and collectors spirited iniduals away.This fascination was fatal: the greater mouse-eared bat was barely seen again in Dorset, apart from reports of “very large, broad-winged bats” in an appropriately gothic setting: flying around Corfe Castle. Although another small colony of greater mouse-eared bats was found in West Sussex in the late 1960s, by 1992 the species was declared extinct in Britain, the first mammal to disappear from our shores since the wolf 250 years ago.Bats fly beneath our radar. While butterfly sightings have been collected for 400 years and birds have been scientifically monitored for more than 70 years, bats only been systematically counted for less than two decades. Little is known about many of Britain’s 18 bat species, some of which exist in perilously low numbers. Today they are threatened perhaps more than they’ve ever been by the loss of their insect prey, the conversion of old barns and derelict buildings in which they roost, and the bright lights of new suburbs, wind farms and speeding vehicles that bamboozle or kill them.The unexpected reappearance of the greater mouse-eared bat in its West Sussex tunnel, in 2002, was a symbol of hope. Against the odds, bats are surviving in our human-dominated land and, perhaps more than any other wild animal, they are constantly surprising us.Bats are great survivors. The oldest known fossil of a bat, found in a quarry in Wyoming in 2003, is about 52.5m years old. Bats have been evolving for so long, and with so many specialised attributes, from echolocation to drastically extended forelimbs, that the order of Chiroptera – “winged hands” in Latin – accounts for one in five species of mammal. They are supremely successful animals. As one expert puts it: when you have been evolving for so long, you’ve perfected the business of being a bat.That business is becoming tricker in a human-dominated world. In older times, they were feared and despised. Modern people may be more tolerant, but even beneficent parts of society – from harvesters of renewable energy to vicars – are often hostile to bats. Energy-efficient homes seal up roof spaces where bats once roosted. New roads – and the planned route of the HS2 railway – block traditional foraging routes. LED lighting is particularly disturbing for bats. Wind farms chop them up: according to a study published in 2016, researchers using sniffer dogs to find and retrieve bat carcasses calculated that 29 onshore windfarms killed 194 dead bats per month – a kill-rate that would dispatch 80,000 bats a year across Britain, without accounting for migrating bats taken out by the rapidly expanding rows of offshore turbines.Earlier this year, members of the House of Lords spoke in favour of a bill that seeks to remove bats’ legal protection in churches unless there is a “significant” adverse impact on rare bat populations. The Bishop of Norwich blamed barn conversions for driving bats into churches, with more than half of 12,000 listed churches housing roosts of bats. Worshippers had “come to the end of their tether,” warned the bishop, because of bat droppings despoiling brasses, fabrics and fittings. For much of the 1990s and early 2000s, the Movement Against Bats in Churches – founded by a vicar’s wife – campaigned to eliminate the blight of bats. Is there another animal in Britain that has a dedicated protest movement against it?Bats that overcome these challenges can live a long time. Only 19 mammal species are longer-lived relative to their body size than humans, and all but one of these are bats. (The other is the naked mole rat.) And of these unusually durable mammals, the greater mouse-eared bat is one of the longest-lived of all: it can clock up more than 35 years. Scientists recently discovered that its longevity is probably due to the fact that, unlike most mammals, its telomeres – a string-like material at the end of its chromosomes – do not shorten with age. They hope further insights from the unique biology of Myotis myotis may one day help humans live longer.Time passes in a different way for such a long-lived animal, and so it seems with its s. I first contacted natural scientist and bat expert Tony Hutson in early 2017, and it was more than a year before he agreed to take me to see the bat. Hutson, a retired entomologist from the Natural History Museum, is wary of any interference in the creature’s peaceful existence. Each month of winter, Hutson and other local recorders count the bats hibernating in several old railway tunnels, and each month I begged to be allowed to tag along. After the bat was inspected without me in December, January and February, finally Hutson agreed that I could accompany them on an extra trip they would undertake in March, with a big caveat: they didn’t normally inspect the bat so late in winter, and could not guarantee it would still be hanging there.Hutson is the second in a short lineage of champions of the greater mouse-eared bat. The first was a wildlife-loving tea-planter from Ceylon called Captain William Watt Addison Phillips. Phillips grew up in Staffordshire during the reign of Queen Victoria, and headed to Colombo to become a tea-planter when he was 19. Living among the civets, leopards and sloth bears of Ceylon, he catalogued its natural history and published papers including “On the habits of the Ceylon Gerbil”.After retiring, Phillips conducted a survey of the flora and fauna of the Males for the Natural History Museum before settling in Bognor Regis in 1959, just after the first greater mouse-eared bat frenzy. Phillips remained active and insatiably curious in retirement, taking an interest in every kind of animal and plant around him. He was also lucky: one day he found a grey long-eared bat – Britain’s second-rarest species – sprawled on his dustbin. It was dead. Some years later, Phillips explored some derelict railway tunnels in Sussex with his grandson. In one, they were delighted to discover a small colony of greater mouse-eared bats. Bearing in mind the old shooting aficionado’s adage, “What hits is history, what’s missed is mystery,” Phillips shouldered his gun, brought down a couple and donated the specimens to the eager curators of the Natural History Museum, who added them to their collections.At the time, Tony Hutson was working as a scientific researcher in the museum and, by chance, had already met Bill Phillips a few years earlier, during an expedition to the Males. Hutson had first become fascinated by bats as a boy, when he saw them above an old priory. He was particularly gripped when he first witnessed the mystery of their motionless hibernation. “That got me – that they will sit there without moving for three or four months,” he says. “How are they doing nothing?” Growing up in south London, he joined a natural history youth group that met at the Natural History Museum as a young man, he applied for a job there. He had a cup of tea with a secretary and asked if he could help its scientists who were studying bats. “They said: ‘No, but we can give you a job in entomology.’” So Hutson cunningly pursued his passion by studying the ectoparasites – such as fleas – that live on bats.As one of the museum’s bat experts, Hutson spent much of his time coaxing irate homeowners not to destroy colonies of rare bats roosting in their roofs. But there were moments of adventure, too. He undertook an expedition to a cave in Ecuador with Erich von Däniken, the Swiss author of Chariots of the Gods, who believed that aliens visited Earth and influenced early human culture. The explorers were winched into the cave by helicopter and the astronaut Neil Armstrong came along. “The theory was that if we did meet any aliens, he would be the best person for them to talk to,” said Hutson. He found no aliens, but they did come across a few interesting bat species.After taking note of Bill Phillips’ surprising discovery of a colony of greater mouse-eared bats in Sussex, Hutson first visited the old railway tunnels in 1974, and saw the bats for himself. “I was working with ectoparasites of bats at the time, so I’d sometimes come down and poke a few around, searching for parasites,” he said. The tunnel was bricked up, with a locked door at one end, to stop visitors from causing a repeat of the scenes that destroyed the Dorset population in the 1950s. (The bats gained access via ventilation grills.) Each year in the 1980s, Hutson unlocked the door and counted the greater mouse-eared bats inside. Each year, their numbers dwindled. The Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981 gave bats and their roosts legal protection for the first time, but then, disaster: one winter, all the female greater mouse-eared bats disappeared from the tunnel. It seemed that their maternity roost – the barn or some other unknown place in Britain where the females raised their young during the summer – must have been destroyed, perhaps in a fire, or by developers. By 1992, the greater mouse-eared bat was declared extinct.But Tony Hutson did not give up. Each winter, he continued to check tunnels and disused mines all over the south of England. Nine years later, his vigilance was vindicated. He heard reports of a live bat found, grounded, in Bognor, and raced to the seaside town. By the time he arrived, this old female bat had died. And it presented another puzzle: it was disabled.“A bat’s forearms are usually the same length, but on this bat they were different lengths,” he remembered. “Whether it spent its life flying around in circles, I’m not sure.” Was there a secret, residual population of mouse-eared bats? It appeared not, for this venerable female showed no sign of ever having bred, and no sign of having communed with any other mouse-eared bats. “There were no parasites on it that it would have picked up from others of its kind, which is what I was looking for,” said Hutson. But the find put him on high alert.At the end of 2002, his annual inspection of the old tunnel where the bats had been found by Captain Bill Phillips in the 1960s revealed a single greater mouse-eared bat. It was a young male, born that spring. Hutson and the protectors placed a silver tag on its elbow and wondered how this species would surprise them next.By March, I was desperate to see this bat. I met Hutson on a murky day in a layby close to the secret tunnel. He had been visiting the bat each month over winter, but offered no crumb of comfort. “Whether he flew off last night, I don’t know,” he said with a twitch of deadpan humour. We set off through a woodland with some fellow bat enthusiasts: Crispin Scott of the National Trust, and Sue Harris and Martin Phillis, volunteer bat recorders for Sussex bat group and part of a network of bat fans who form the Bat Conservation Trust. This small charity is the national voice for bats in Britain, and Hutson revealed, with characteristic modesty, that he helped set it up.We walked down the cutting of an old railway line, sharp lumps of chalk and fallen trees tumbling down the banks. The tiniest trace of people having walked along the cutting worried the protectors. “It’s too open,” said Scott. “We need to fell a couple of trees across here so only people in the know come down.” At the end was a tunnel of red brick, marching into the hillside.At the centre of its bricked-up entrance was an iron hatch. Phillis pulled out a key, unlocked the top and the bottom, and we squeezed inside. The tunnel was cool but not freezing dark but not pitch-black. Daylight shone from the grille above our heads and in the far distance, like a mirage, was a crescent of light, another grille, 680 metres away, at the tunnel’s end.I hadn’t anticipated the water. There was the sound of constant dripping as water oozed through the brick ceiling and hit the stony floor. The bricks glistened with moisture. “Bats need it very humid,” said Hutson. “If it gets too dry, they dehydrate.” There were black stains on curved tunnel walls and ceiling. Only when we later emerged and discovered our faces were streaked with black did I realise that this was archeological soot, from the steam trains that last entered this tunnel in the 1950s.The bat protectors wielded head and hand torches and began by painstakingly sweeping their beams up and down the curved walls of the tunnel, inspecting ginger-coloured fungi, straggly like beards, and searching for the bats that clung in crevices where mortar or brickwork had come away. Different species shared this tunnel. Smaller species may temporarily wake from hibernation to pee or feed if it is mild, but the greater mouse-eared goes deeper into the tunnel and remains motionless for longer. Hutson pointed out the different species, with their distinctive features. The natterer’s bat has long, trumpety ears and a Daz-white belly Daubenton’s bat has big feet, which it uses to grab insects off the surface of ponds. These bats are counted three times each winter for Bat Conservation Trust hibernation surveys.We probably didn’t need to, but we talked in low murmurs. I walked past the bats’ somnolent bodies with the same care I take while tiptoeing into my children’s bedroom when they are sleeping.The first question Hutson asked when he found the mouse-eared bat in 2002 was: where did it go after its winter hibernation? Answer this question, and he might find other members of its tribe. Hutson contacted colleagues in Portugal who better knew its lifestyle and were familiar with its preferred summer habitats. “We organised a big survey, well sort of,” he said. “We met in the pub and looked at prime local habitat. It was a time when they were cutting a lot of hay and these bats often go for freshly cut hay, where they can find more insects.”During summer, the greater mouse-eared bat roosts high in church and castle turrets in northern Europe, and in caves in the south. Hutson looked in old sand and chalk mines, and in disused lime kilns. He asked industrial archeologists and consulted other societies for secretive enthusiasts. “There’s always some nut looking for holes in the ground,” he said. “We combed the region for suitable sites.” The bat group appealed to the media, encouraging people to look for big bats. They collected a hair sample to use DNA to identify its origin, but the lab scientists weren’t able to extract DNA at the time.The broadcaster and naturalist Chris Packham came to film the hunt. But there was no trace of the bat or any of its kin. The bat did turn up at the Sussex tunnel the next winter, however, and the winter after that. Hutson considered putting a VHS radio tag on the bat, but was worried that the burden of a tag could kill it, and he would be blamed. “What put me off in the end was if it didn’t turn up again that winter, I’d be drummed out of the country,” he said. In 2007, however, the protectors plucked up the courage to carefully take the bat off the tunnel wall during its hibernation and inspect it. Its teeth were a bit worn, but it was in good health – and very alone. During his inspection of its private parts, Hutson found signs that it had never been sexually active.We were now 300 metres inside the tunnel. A natterer’s was stuffed into a crevice no wider than a centimetre. “He’s awake, isn’t he?” said Hutson, swiftly moving his torch away so as not to disturb it. Then he pointed his torch towards a bat that was noticeably larger than the others: solid, and tea-cup sized. “A very rare bat,” he said, “but not rare enough for you.” A Bechstein’s bat.What of the mouse-eared bat? “He has definitely moved,” said Sue Harris, who had noted his position during their previous inspection, in February. We were in the relatively warm middle of the tunnel, where it was 8.2C, but there was no bat. Harris walked ahead. Suddenly, her methodical movements became frantic. “I can hardly contain my excitement,” she called out.High up, where a whole brick had fallen from the curve of the tunnel wall, hung a large, sandy-coloured bat. A silver ring wrapped around its forearm shone in our torchlight. The greater mouse-eared bat. The natterer’s bats we had seen weighed 8g. This one weighed more than 30g, with a broad pink muzzle, a long, pale underside, and dark-brown wings folded up tight by its side like an umbrella.It would be hard to bond with a creature you only ever saw perfectly still, in a deep sleep, face averted from the world. Was Hutson fond of it? “I shall be sorry when it’s not there, assuming I outlive it,” he said. “You never know – it might have another 20 years to go. It might be having an easy time, no stresses. It looks quite tough, sort of robust.” But Harris was worried. “He’s looking damp, especially around the neck area. He didn’t look at all damp in February,” she said. Droplets of water glistened silver on his fur. His ring looked tarnished.The bat’s unknowability was frustrating but, after 16 years, Hutson had become resigned to the unanswered questions about this inidual, and the fate of the species in Britain. Where does this bat go? Perhaps to France? Are there really no others? “After a few years I wondered if we should have done more in terms of finding others,” said Hutson, “but now I’m convinced it is a loner and whatever we had done wouldn’t have made a difference.” Could they reintroduce the species using wild specimens caught in continental Europe? “The first problem is that they would have to go into quarantine for at least six months because of rabies. After being in captivity for six months they wouldn’t be too good at operating in the wild.”We reached the end of the tunnel. There was no exit, just a solid wall of breezeblocks. The bat seemed less a pioneer, the first of its kind, than a survivor, the last of its kind – like the tunnel, a dead-end.If there really is only one greater mouse-eared bat in Britain, with no possibility of reproduction, then it is as good as extinct. Seven other British bat species exist in such low numbers that no reliable population data exists. But technology such as bat detectors, which reveal bats by the sound of their echolocation, is helping better monitor populations. The Bat Conservation Trust’s systematic monitoring of 10 species since the start of this century has revealed an unexpected picture: nine of these appear to be increasing in number. If true, it is yet another way in which bats have surprised us.But counting bats accurately is difficult, said Mathews. They are usually counted where they are known to roost, but scientists have yet to work out a way of counting the number of roosts in an area. “Unless we know that, it makes it very, very difficult to understand what is going on with the population,” she said. Current threats to bats seem to spring from misunderstanding of both human and bat nature. Today, every bat and every roosting site in the EU is protected by the EU Habitats Directive. But legal protection infuriates many home-owners and developers, and may encourage the furtive destruction of bat colonies.Environmental legislation usually follows a “polluter pays” principle, but with bats, the person providing a home for bats is penalised, and must meet all the expense of surveying and providing alternative sites. The government is promising that after Brexit, public money for farmers will be based on the services they provide for the ecosystem (clean water, fertile soils etc). Mathews wondered whether a similar formula could be applied to homeowners who provide bat services.“You can understand why people find it frustrating when they want to convert their barn and it’s got bats in it and it’s a complete palaver,” she said. “Whoever has a bat roost is providing a service to the rest of the community, so there should be a community effort to make sure the bats are protected.”The second challenge for bats is another visible sign of society’s supposed care for them: the bat bridges that  new roads. These trellises of wires hung between telegraph poles either side of the carriageway are designed to funnel bats up and safely over fast-moving traffic so they are not killed by cars and lorries when they follow their traditional foraging routes across new roads. Unfortunately, they don’t work: bats are still killed by moving vehicles. And there is no funding to monitor how bats use these bridges, if at all, or to test whether there may be a design that does work.Despite the roads, the regulations, the wind turbines and the barn conversions, Mathews feels there are grounds for optimism for Britain’s rarest bat. The greater mouse-eared bat may have dipped in and out of extinction in Britain, but after decades of decline in northern Europe, the species is on the rise again in countries such as Austria. She believes it might be possible to find out more about the lonely bat’s mysterious life. “My first question was: why don’t we put a GPS tag on it?” she said. “It’s already 16. It’s now or never. We don’t want to intervene and hasten the demise of this animal – it’s that burden of responsibility – , but on the other hand, it does seem a rather wasted opportunity not to find out anything else about it. If it had been me, I would’ve been blitzing the place looking for evidence of greater mouse-eared bats, and I don’t think anybody has.” A new scientific review of British mammal populations states that it is “plausible” that other iniduals are present, and could be revealed by exhaustive searches of potential summer roosting locations, or sites where they “swarm” in autumn.Mathews will start doing just that this summer, putting out special nets – such as a harp trap, a large frame with strings between it which cause a bat to drop unharmed into a collection chamber below. “The same species on the continent is often found in churches and castles and big buildings. We could start looking at these sorts of places. We could also do DNA analysis of historic droppings. Perhaps it does go to France every summer and comes back? Surely it won’t be the only one doing that? We could do some more work in the autumn, when these bats exhibit swarming behaviour. If there are others in the area that happen not to hibernate in the tunnel, it’s possible they may turn up at that time of year.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47b7eb1e34bc6f27948100f9b2843dd988af4531/0_0_3845_2548/master/3845.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7125c5a8c102d5bb324d8749ea4f3c45 480w","title":"brexit weekly briefing crunch time for may as commons vote looms","story":"Rebel Tories may be backing off but PM struggling to unite cabinet over post-Brexit future Welcome to the ’s weekly Brexit briefing.

I am trying to negotiate the best deal for Britain ... But if the Lords amendments are allowed to stand, that negotiating position will be undermined.The prime minister’s comments came amid warnings from Tory rebels that despite earlier reports they were backing away from voting against May - in part because the resulting humiliation could threaten her leadership and let in Boris Johnson - they were not yet satisfied with some of her changes to the legislation. But if ministers were confident a revolt on the withdrawal bill would be headed off, May is still struggling to unite her warring cabinet over the white paper on the UK’s post-Brexit future. A peace summit has been called at Chequers, her country retreat – but not until after the EU summit later this month.This all follows a long private meeting last week with the Brexit secretary, David Davis, who expressed a litany of frustrations but was dissuaded from resigning by a concession to insert a (sort-of) end date in the final text of the government’s proposal on the “backstop” agreement on the Northern Irish border.Needless to say, the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, as good as rejected the plan –, which would leave the whole of the UK in the customs union after transition until the future arrangement has been agreed, almost as soon as it was announced, clarifying later with slides that it would still lead to a hard border.

Under our noses, a well-developed network of far-right and nationalist forces seems to have arisen, apparently digitally mobilised and funded by Russian state actors the law regulating elections, campaigns and referendums is woefully out of date (passed four years before Facebook was launched) Moscow is laughing at the rest of the world as Trump pleads its case at the G7 the far-right swoons over Vladimir Putin and Jeremy Corbyn misses no opportunity to give the Russian president the benefit of the doubt over the use of nerve agents on British soil and the deployment of chemical weapons in Syria by his puppet in Damascus. This week, as the Commons votes on the very future of this country, don’t forget how we got here how badly we underestimated the populist right and how the leader of the opposition tends to make things easier for Putin, too. Still laughing?In the Observer, Will Hutton argues that as their cause crumbles, Brexiters are turning to fantasy and bitter recriminations – and it’s time for Labour to step up:As a policy, Brexit is beginning to look like the poll tax: attractive as a rightwing pet project but disastrous in practice. Then, the Tory party still had enough political nous to rescue itself, even at the cost of losing its prime minister. Now, as Boris Johnson acknowledges and David Davis’s threatened resignation symbolised, it is at war with itself and the realists are trying to rescue a third-best solution against those in Brexit La-La land. Theresa May’s impossible mission is to reconcile Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nigel Farage’s red lines on sovereignty, freedom of movement and leaving every EU institution and trade policy, with an economy that requires the opposite. It would be hard enough with a united cabinet and years of negotiating time within the two years allowed by the article 50 process and Brexit millenarian narcissists it cannot be done. Occasionally in politics there is the opportunity to do the right thing and secure massive party advantage. If Jeremy Corbyn were to declare that the Labour party wanted to stay in the EU – crucially, only politically sellable with new and aggressive initiatives to identify, control and manage the numbers of immigrants – he would transform his and his party’s standing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/076b20a4fd3a296edb29f949a88a096ed737e6ad/0_131_3435_2061/master/3435.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6d4d059d5761438896b60637be1529c","title":"brexit no 10 rejects last minute meaningful vote compromise ahead of key vote politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments, including MPs debating and voting on Lords amendmentsDavis is now talking about the “meaningful vote” issue. (See 12.56pm.)He says a peer described the Hailsham amendment as a no Brexit one.He quotes from the article Vernon Bogdanor, the constitutional expert, wrote at the weekend. Bogdanor wrote:More fundamentally, the Hailsham amendment would substitute parliament for government in the negotiating process. If parliament refused to approve the agreement, it would require the government to return to the negotiating table to secure a better one. That is a constitutional absurdity. Parliament’s role is to scrutinise legislation and policy 650 MPs, still less 800 peers, cannot themselves negotiate.Davis says it has always been accepted that the government negotiates treaties. That was the case when the Maastricht treaty or the Amsterdam treaty or the Lisbon treaty were being considered by parliament.Labour’s Frank Field says, if the Lords amendment stands, the government will be going naked into the negotiating chamber.Davis says the European commission reads all British papers, especially the Financial Times and the Times. And they believe them, he says.He says the Europeans do not want the UK to leave.He summarises the Hailsham amendment (pdf).Davis says people who talk about a meaningful vote want to reverse the result of the referendum.Davis is now talking about delegated powers.He refers to a Lords amendment saying ministers should only used delegated powers when “necessary”, not when “appropriate”.He says in practice it may be necessary for ministers to use these power when they are appropriate.The SNP’s Joanna Cherry intervenes. She says the government is going back on pledge made when the legislation was proposed.Davis says the Lords amendment could prevent ministers making sensible changes to regulations.Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general and a leading pro-European, says he does not agree. Davis says Grieve is a very good lawyer. But other lawyers disagree.Ken Clarke, the Conservative former chancellor, and a laywer, says appropriate could mean anything. Ministers could use it to change laws in almost any circumstances. He says, with “appropriate” at the test, minsters could not be challenged in court.Davis says Clarke is a good friend. They were able to have lunch together for two hours without discussing Brexit. But he says he disagrees on this.Davis is now talking about the Lords amendment removing the amendment introduced by the government in the Commons putting the Brexit “exit day” in the bill.He says the Commons had already reached “a sensible position” on this matter. The government will stick to it.Davis says the government has improved the bill in a number of areas.He is going to address the main issues addressed the amendments in the group being discussed today.First, there were amendments to the “sifting committee” (a committee being set up to decide what pieces of secondary legislation introduced under the bill get put to a full vote in the Commons.)Davis says the Lords amendments would make it harder for ministers to use secondary legislation.He says he knows the Lords want to improve the bill. Their changes can seem sensible in isolation. But their cumulative affect is damaging, he says.David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is opening the debate now.He says more than 1,000 non-government amendments have been debated, and hundreds of government ones.Today they are debating the Lords ones.He says, when amendments have been made undermining the purpose of the bill, or undermining Brexit, the government will reject them.The programme motion has passed by 321 votes to 304 - a majority of 17.Both of Theresa May’s mooted customs plans are very unlikely to be accepted, meaning that the Brexit process is heading for a “major crunch”, according to Sir Ivan Rogers, the UK’s former chief diplomat to the EU.Appearing before the Commons home affairs committee, Rogers – who stepped down from the role in January 2017 and has since then regularly expressed sceptical views on the Brexit process – also warned how extraordinarily complex it would be to leave the EU, saying people must realise it was a process of many stages.Quizzed about the two customs plans, the so-called max fac and the customs partnership, Rogers said both seemed implausible. On max fac he said:Max fac doesn’t solve the problem as other see it, so they don’t understand why max fac is on the table at all. However facilitated the border, it’s still a border, and still demonstrably different from what we’ve got now. So I don’t think you’ll ever get max fac agreed, personally.On the customs partnership he said:If you were confronted by that from the other side of the table, and that were Europeans putting it to us and saying, could we police your external border of your external customs union, and operate that, I can imagine what the UK systems answer would be.After the customs partnership idea had been submitted by the UK, Rogers said, the EU had asked “five killer questions” on how it would work, and received no answer. He continued:If they’re in that position and saying neither max fac nor new customs partnership is a runner then, you know, you don’t need to be in my shoes to say we’re heading for a major crunch.On the sheer complexity of Brexit, Rogers told MPs:And then you’re developing, over time, some immediately some less immediately, a different relationship which the EU where some bits you like … and there are other areas where you may want autonomy and ergence, and quite radical ergence over time, but you may not be able to assess in the next couple of years how radical.This is a revolutionary system change. If you take Brexit seriously, which I do, you can’t say, we can do all that in a jiffy. It’s not going to happen.He added: “That’s not obstructive to say that, it’s just to say all of this is going to be bloody difficult to do.”This would, he said, require a series of stages of exit. Rogers said that while he did not see membership of the EEA - the so-called Norway model – as a good long-term answer, it could be “a perch for a number of years where you got some of the freedoms and sovereignty that you would want”.He added: I’ve always seen an EEA model as implausible as the mediumlonger term destination, but not necessarily inconceivable as a short-term transition chamber route out of the EU.Here is the Commons library briefing (pdf) explaining all the Lords amendments that MPs will be voting on this afternoon.And here is a shorter guide from my colleague Peter Walker.There will be two sets of votes this afternoon - at 4.15pm and at 7.15pm.The vote on the “meaningful vote” amendment or amendments (see 12.56pm) will come in the first tranche of voting.MPs are now starting the debate on the EU withdrawal bill.First they have to agree the programme motion setting out the timetable for the debate - six hours today and six hours tomorrow.There has been an objection, and so it is being put to a vote.The key vote this afternoon will be on what is being described as the “meaningful vote” issue. This refers to the vote that parliament will have on the Brexit withdrawal agreement if, as planned, it is agreed in the autumn.But the term “meaningful vote” is not particularly helpful because there are at least five versions of what this might entail. Here is a quick summary.1 - The government version - “take it or leave it”. Originally Theresa May resisted offering MPs a vote on the final Brexit deal, and she only confirmed that there would be one in her Lancaster House speech in January 2017. The government firmed up the commitment when the article 50 bill was going through parliament, and gave an even more precise commitment in a written statement in December. Ministers do not accept that this is a meaningless offer MPs will be able to say no. But if they do say no, the UK will leave the EU without a deal, which is why critics say this would not amount to a meaningful vote.2 - The Dominic Grieve version from December - limiting the powers ministers will have to implement Brexit until MPs have passed legislation. This is the amendment passed by MPs, against the wishes of the government, in December. The government was defeated by a majority of 4 after 12 Tories rebelled. At the time this was widely reported as a “meaningful vote” amendment. But actually what it was really about was preventing ministers using powers in the EU withdrawal bill to implement Brexit until an EU withdrawal and implementation bill has been passed.3 - The Lords version - enabling parliament to take charge if the withdrawal deal is not passed. This amendment, tabled by the Conservative former cabinet minister Viscount Hailsham (Douglas Hogg) was passed by peers in April by a majority of 91. The wording is complicated (pdf), but essentially it says that if MPs do not pass a resolution backing the deal agreed by the government, the government is obliged to follow “any direction” in future Brexit talks set out in a resolution passed by the Commons. That means, if MPs were to vote down the deal but vote in favour of a resolution telling ministers to go back to Brussels and try a different approach, ministers would have to obey. This is the version the government wants to vote down today.4 - The government compromise - a ministerial statement after a no vote. In an attempt to avert defeat, the government has tabled a compromise amendment to be debated today. It is amendment 19 (a), on the order paper here (pdf). It is quite long, and gives details of documents the government will publish before the autumn vote, but essentially it does not alter the fact that a vote against the deal would not stop the UK leaving the EU without a deal. The key new commitment is that, if MPs were to vote no, a minister would come back to the Commons within 28 days to say what would happen next. Since the answer could be “not much”, it is not seen as a significant concession.5 - The latest Grieve proposal - enabling parliament to take charge at the last moment. This is the amendment tabled last night, and it is an amendment to Davis’s amendment. It says if there is no agreement by 30 November, there must be a vote on what happens next. And if there is no agreement by 15 February 2019, the government would be bound to follow any “direction” given by MPs in a resolution passed by the Commons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49932f7b4e4527444692e6b82813da7b3e6cbc26/812_14_2293_1376/master/2293.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=140c4c4a339ac265ba3238cebffba4ef","title":"david haye retires from boxing tony bellew defeat","story":"David Haye has announced his retirement from boxing at the age of 37. The former WBA heavyweight champion insisted he would stop fighting if he again lost to Tony Bellew in their rematch last month, and having shown significant signs of decline before being stopped in five rounds, he has confirmed he no longer plans to fight on.Haye first announced his retirement in October 2011, on his 31st birthday, before a lucrative grudge match with Dereck Chisora the following summer tempted him to return. He had lost his crown in July 2011 to Wladimir Klitschko.Haye become lineal world cruiserweight champion beat Jean-Marc Mormeck in November 2007, then two years later overcame Nikolai Valuev to become WBA heavyweight champion.He was also advised to retire following surgery on his right shoulder in November 2013, but returned in January 2016 to secure two unremarkable victories and then suffer his third and fourth professional defeats, both against Bellew.“Thanks to boxing, I have been able to live my unencumbered childhood dream,” Haye said in a statement. “I became the first ever British boxer to unify the cruiserweight ision. I then achieved my childhood dream when I beat WBA heavyweight champion of the world Nikolai Valuev, the ‘Beast from the East’, in a real life ‘David and Goliath’ match.“Lifting that world heavyweight championship meant I’d fulfilled a promise I’d made to my mum, Jane, at the age of three. It also meant I was the second boxer in history – after Evander Holyfield – to win world titles at cruiserweight and heavyweight. That was an incredibly proud moment.“For my fans, it must have been like going to support their favourite thoroughbred racehorse at the Grand National, only to see their stallion stumble out of the gates like a sedated mule at the Donkey Derby.“I saw punches coming but wasn’t quick enough to avoid them. I created openings but lacked the speed and agility to capitalise on them. Quick counterattacks, the sort I’ve effortlessly thrown since my teenage years, are no longer in my armoury. When I take shots, they now shake me to my boots.“The things I used to be able to do in the ring – instinctively – now exist only in my mind and in video clips of my old fights.”Meanwhile, Eddie Hearn is trying to determine whether Deontay Wilder is serious when he claims he wants to fight Anthony Joshua in the UK.The American tweeted that he was happy to accept an offer from the Joshua camp to come over for a unification bout later this year. Joshua is already pencilled in to take on the WBA mandatory challenger, Alexander Povetkin of Russia, but a fight against Wilder could yet take place before that.“The fact that we’ve lost four weeks waiting for an answer from Deontay Wilder makes a fight happening in 11 or 12 weeks of this magnitude unlikely.“I think if it is before Povetkin then it runs on OctoberNovember. It’s all come as a bit of a shock that Deontay’s finally come back to us on the offer and seems to accept the terms. Now we have to find out if it’s bluster or if it’s real.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7af48241951533930f90768f583a652cadf93481/23_93_2665_1600/master/2665.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47933ff4c5c3053dec19e1b69d0644d5","title":"the spin scotland england world cup cricket","story":"The enthralling Scottish match raised two simple questions. Why are Scotland not playing in the 2019 World Cup? Why are England favourites for that competition?Scotland performed brilliantly at the Grange in a wonderfully entertaining contest, which could be appreciated on either side of Hadrian’s Wall. They have never scored so many runs they have seldom played better. They were, however, given a helping hand by an England side whose defeat unwittingly reopened the debate about the format of cricket’s World Cup.England were hapless in the field from 11 o’clock on Sunday. It is hard to fathom what they were doing in the field then but these are only the thoughts of an antediluvian. England won the toss and put Scotland in to bat in Edinburgh. There was once a school of thought that the decision taken at the toss should be influenced by this question: “What is the best way to get to the halfway point in charge of the game?”Choosing to bowl first is obviously a good option if the wicket is damp or green, allowing the pacemen a chance to prevail. The notion of exploiting early moisture is sound but this did not apply on Sunday. The sun rose in Edinburgh at 4.28am last weekend so there was probably enough time for any moisture to burn off. Moreover the wicket was true, the outfield fast and the boundaries short. Goodness knows how many England might have scored without the pressure of chasing. Probably the only way England could have lost that game was by letting Scotland bat first and exploit the benign conditions. The stock response to such silly old‑fashioned thinking is that it can be “tricky to set a total” on such a surface and “we think we can chase anything”.Admittedly England did not distinguish themselves with the ball. Indeed it was tough to work out how they can be World Cup favourites when watching this attack on Sunday. England have an array of potent batsmen who can smash the ball everywhere but history suggests the trophy is won usually by the side which has the best bowling attack, one that can cope in sublime batting conditions. England’s seamers offered no movement, pace or guile. Or straight yorkers, which are now as out‑of-date as Hula Hoops.Yorkers should be the first port of call when the batsmen are getting out of hand and if they happen to be straight there is always the chance of dismissing someone. True, straight balls can be risky when the batsman is dancing around his crease but with the risk comes reward – when they miss. One reason why these yorkers are so out of vogue is because they are very difficult to deliver and the margin of error is small so bowlers tend to shrink from that option another may be that they are so very 20th century.So much for England’s frailties. What of Scotland’s long-term prospects in a week when their rivals, Afghanistan, join Ireland as a Test nation? Scotland have the same ambitions for Test cricket but at the moment perhaps the best they can hope for\u0026nbspis to participate in an enlarged World Cup in 2023. They should be there. This does not represent a Damascene conversion on my part, but in the past I have not been so zealous as some of my colleagues about the urgency to increase the number of teams in the tournament.My concerns have centred upon a fear of too many one-sided games, an argument weakened considerably by the match in Edinburgh, and the dangers of an unnecessarily elongated competition. Often in World\u0026nbspCups it has taken at least a month to establish the quarter-finalists, whereupon the tournament comes to life, even though by then some of the players are exhausted having been compelled to travel thousands of miles in the group games.There have barely been two World Cups with the same format. In the Caribbean in 2007 the International Cricket Council may have thought it had found the perfect system, which allowed 16 teams to participate. These were initially split into groups of four, from which two sides would progress to the next stage. The theory had merit in practice it was soon regarded as a disaster. After playing three matches India were eliminated and the ICC’s commercial wing were tearing their hair out at the consequent loss of revenue. This could not be allowed to happen again.Of course the problem is not insoluble, though, as in most cricketing decisions, at home and away, the one that seems to be the most obviously lucrative is always the favoured option, regardless of the more distant consequences.Here is a rough guide to how things could be improved: a 14-team competition which requires qualification for two or four sides since the recent tournament in Zimbabwe, from which Afghanistan and West Indies emerged as the finalists and therefore participants in the 2019 World Cup, was such a riveting and worthwhile event.There would be two groups of seven sides which all play each other. The top teams in each group would have a safe passage to their semi-final the other four would play an eliminator to reach the semi-finals as is the case in the Royal London Cup.Such a system removes the criticism, which is often valid, that “we know who the eight quarter-finalists are going to be before the tournament starts”. That was almost the case in 2015 in Australasia. There was some drama along the way but seven out of eight of the\u0026nbsp“senior” sides made it only England of that octet failed to do so.Such a system might satisfy the Scots. If they play with the same passion as they did on Sunday they would surely book their place in the top 14.• This is an extract taken from the Spin, the ’s weekly cricket email.

This does not mean a definitive end to the Britbet project, which could still launch later in the year if talks do not progress.\u0026nbspA statement issued by Britbet on Tuesday morning said it would continue to install new hardware at those 55 tracks and transfer of on-course Tote staff to Britbet will also continue as planned. But the Tote brand will now have an extended life at racecourses beyond the middle of next month.\u0026nbspAlizeti, which has a guaranteed option to take over the Tote in three to five years, is backed by a group of unnamed investors. It describes those people as racehorse owners with a long-term intention to bring some benefit to the sport from their business. Britbet will surely want something more than expressions of altruism.Today’s main action is at Salisbury, where Pilot Wings (3.00) appeals as a solid option at 9-4. From the Roger Charlton yard which appears to be working its way into form, this three-year-old improved a lot for his first run when a staying-on sixth of 19 at Newbury last month. He was allowed to start at 66-1 that day and looked green but another step forward here will make him hard to beat.\u0026nbspLater, Ablaze (5.00) could go well in the middle-distance handicap at 11-2, having scored over the course and distance on her reappearance last month. She’s only up 4lb and faces a favourite who remains a maiden after eight starts.\u0026nbspAt Thirsk, I fancied Ravenswood in the second race but so does everyone else, evidently, and odds of 3-1 are a bit mad. A better option at 5-1 could be Revenge (5.15) in a later sprint handicap.\u0026nbspThis Tim Easterby youngster never got into it at Wolverhampton last time after a slow start but I’ll take a chance that he can return to the form he had previously been showing on turf, which would make him dangerous here.

Really given that a wallop from a ball too short to a player like Jones, who stands tall in the crease and requires no encouragement to play from he back foot. They go upstairs to make sure it has gone the distance, and it has: SIX RUNS! Kapp is right back on it next ball, sliding a yorker into Jones, who just keeps it out. Later in the over, an even better shot from Jones, square driving with wonderful timing to the boundary at cover point. Whaddashot! She’s up and about. “She does look the real deal at the top of the order,” says her former captain Charlotte Edwards on TMS.7th: England 35-0 (Jones 17, Beaumont 16) Both players take singles with nice drives to the point sweeper. Really encouraging way to tick the board over in these early overs when building a base. Beaumont continues to present a straight blade to Khaka. She’s in much better touch today. 6th: England 33-0 (Jones 16, Beaumont 15) Kapp keeping Jones honest early, who is on the advance later in the over to drive straight. But again, it is too straight, crashing into the stumps at the non-strikers end and she’s robbed of a boundary. Strikes another nice drive to finish, but straight to extra cover. Instead of runs, that is a maiden. South Africa’s first of the day. 5th: England 33-0 (Jones 16, Beaumont 15) Lizelle Lee is up to the stumps for Khaka, who is bowling from our broadcast end. She’s nice and full to Beaumont, who leaps on her front foot to strike a pristine cover drive. That’s Beaumont at her best, what we remember well from the last couple of summers in this country. She’s driving again to end the over, but straight enough that Khaka is able to make a good stop in her follow through. Just the start that England needed after their collapse on Saturday.4th: England 27-0 (Jones 15, Beaumont 10) Unlike her opening partner, Kapp does get a second over. Again, she is using the seam to bring it back at the right handers, this time Beaumont who is a touch uncomfortable early on in the set. Does well to keep her posture and grab one to midwicket. Very poor finish from Kapp, dropping a half-tracker in at Jones who loves pulling, doing so here for four. Can’t bowl there to her. 3rd: England 22-0 (Jones 11, Beaumont 9) Immediate bowling change for South Africa. Very unusual after the first over of the day, Khaka replacing Ismail. The first ball is waaaay wide and called accordingly. Next up, short and wide giving Jones the chance to strike her through cover. An easy boundary, her first today. Does it again next ball, on the back foot and beating the stacked off-side ring field. Very poor start from South Africa from this end. “England are timing the ball beautifully,” says Ebony Rainford-Brent on TMS. Khaka recovers well, but England have taken nine from it. 2nd: England 13-0 (Jones 3, Beaumont 9) Jones turns the strike over first ball from Kapp’s day - gliding to third man - then Beaumont does the same when clipping to square leg. Good running, good start. Better to finish, locating Jones’ inside edge that isn’t far away from the stumps on the deflection. That’s the first delivery to jag back off the seam. 1st: England 10-0 (Jones 1, Beaumont 8) Jones off the mark with a nicely-timed clip through midwicket for one. I like the fact that she’s taking the first delivery again. I had a chat with her after the opening game and at the top of the list is definitely where she wants to be. Shot! Beaumont plays a wonderful straight drive first ball, racing away to the rope. Ideal way to start her day. Ismail sprays the next down the legside and Beaumont uses the extra ball nicely, striking a second boundary for the opening over, this time carving past point. That’s a poor over from Ismail, capitalised by the openers. The players are on the field! Amy Jones and Tammy Beaumont to open for England. Shabnim Ismail will be taking the first over, running away from us at the broadcast end. This is a big day for England’s women, how will they respond? PLAY! A few minutes before we begin. Use them well by reading Vic Marks on why Scotland’s men should be in the 2019 World Cup and how it could work into the future.More from the toss, via the BBC TMS call (which you can grab here) Heather Knight: “I was a bit undecided what to do, the pitch is quite dry so I don’t mind batting first, but we’ve got to bat a bit better than we did the other day,” she said. “As a team, we want to play positive, attacking cricket but adapt to the conditions.”We’re yet to hear if Gunn was dropped or is injured. Either way, Elwiss has earned her recall after sound form with both ball and bat so far this year at all levels of the game. Dane van Niekerk: “The conditions suit us,” she said, citing the experience some of her team had playing at this ground in last year’s KSL Finals. “After the heartbreak of the World Cup, that’s been our driving force, we don’t want to go through that again” No surprises at the toss. South Africa were always going to have a trundle first after what happened on Saturday to keep the pressure firmly on the hosts. And here are those official teams, as named:England: Georgia Elwiss in for Jenny Gunn. Otherwise, unchanged from Saturday. Just waiting on some team sheets. Teams in a tick. Hi Tanya! Don’t forget, you can stay in touch with the county cricket blog too. Forget about a cluttered browser, keep us both open as we move through the day. I see that Somerset need 247 after Notts’ massive second dig, which gives Matt Renshaw ample time to register twin-tons for the fixture. Don’t doubt him, he’s pretty good at cricket.Let’s chat. I feel like I should keep saying that my email has changed since the winter, now at this one. Yeah, you better believe I’m casual. As for the twitter, that’s the same as it ever was. Hit me on both. Would you change the England XI? Are they missing a third front-line seamer? If so, then who? Is South Africa’s pace attack the best in the world? Welcome to Hove for the women’s ODI of the summer between England and South Africa. Despite the season, the weather here is eerily similar how it was an hour before the opening rubber: very gloomy. Let’s hope for England that’s where the comparisons end after their shocker at New Road, a match that was all-but over within an hour. If the home side get knocked off again today, it will be the third time in a row they have lost a 50-over series since holding the World Cup aloft at a packed Lord’s in July last year. There is no panic in the camp as yet, per Anya Shrubsole’s words yesterday, but there might be if they cede this three-rubber contest in straight sets. South Africa are all smiles. Their coach, Hilton Moreeng, said yesterday that it was a “near to perfect” performance from his bowlers, who reduced England to 64 for six on Saturday. With the overhead conditions today, you can be sure that Shabnim Ismail, Marizanne Kapp and Ayabonga Khaka will be hoping to again get first with the ball. The teams are on the field now, England limbering up some some keepy-uppy as the Proteas move into a tight huddle for a chat. The toss is scheduled for 25 minutes from now. I saw Danielle Hazell having a bowl beforehand and it wouldn’t shock me if she came into the side given how well she went in India. Who for, though? We’ll see.Adam will be here shortly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b914025b24dabdd92e724eaec7b25d6584a0489/0_17_2241_1344/master/2241.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72ab1c835e03e0c2b4bfdd96a2980a9d","title":"motorists misled autonomous driving aids tesla nissan report","story":"Tesla and Nissan among carmakers criticised for setting ‘unrealistic expectations’The marketing of driving assistance features such as Autopilot, ProPilot and others as “autonomous” is setting unrealistic expectations and causing dangerous driving, according to insurers and vehicle safety researchers.In a report, Thatcham Research and the Association of British Insurers (ABI) say that drivers are being lulled into a false sense of security by the marketing of new driver assistance features making their way into cars and costing upwards of £20,000.Features such as Tesla’s Enhanced Autopilot and Nissan’s ProPilot, as well as terms such as “full self-driving capability” and being “capable of driving autonomously” are giving the false impression of a level of autonomy not yet available.As such, drivers are not treating these features with the level of scrutiny and attention required resulting in crashes and dangerous driving.“We are starting to see real-life examples of the hazardous situations that occur when motorists expect the car to drive and function on its own,” said Matthew Avery, the head of research at Thatcham Research. “Specifically, where the technology is taking ownership of more and more of the driving task, but the motorist may not be sufficiently aware that they are still required to take back control in problematic circumstances.”Current systems are capable of what is termed level 2 autonomy. This means they are able to keep the car on the road using existing combinations of technologies such as range-guided cruise control and lane-keeping aids. They are not able to deal with the task of driving under all scenarios, meaning that the driver has to pay attention to the road at all times and may have to suddenly take over. A recent spate of accidents involving Tesla’s Autopilot system has highlighted the need for drivers to be much more aware of the limitations of driving aids.In a fatal collision in Silicon Valley in March, a Tesla Model X with Autopilot activated sped up and steered into a concrete barrier at 70.8mph. Another Tesla crashed into a stationary police car in Laguna Beach, while a Model S crashed into the back of a stopped firetruck in Utah. Drivers should have taken over control to avoid these incidents.Drivers have also been found blatantly flouting safety laws, including one man who was banned from driving for 18 months after being filmed sitting in the passenger seat of a Model S in Autopilot mode on the M1.A Tesla spokesperson said: “The feedback that we get from our customers shows that they have a very clear understanding of what Autopilot is, how to properly use it, and what features it consists of. “When using Autopilot, drivers are continuously reminded of their responsibility to keep their hands on the wheel and maintain control of the vehicle at all times. This is designed to prevent driver misuse, and is among the strongest driver-misuse safeguards of any kind on the road today.”While Tesla is the carmaker that’s most aggressive in pushing its driving aids as autonomous systems, similar options are available on cars starting from around £25,000, including the new Nissan Leaf. Renault is also installing the technologies into its next-generation Clio, expected in 2020.“Don’t think it’s just £90,000 Teslas or Mercedes that have got this, it’s going right down the line as manufactures use systems required by Euro NCAP safety regulations to sell features consumers are now demanding,” said Avery.While progress is being made by carmakers towards level 5 fully autonomous vehicles capable of handling all scenarios, their public availability is still many years away.For now, drivers are being sold increasingly sophisticated driving aids that are technically and legally incapable of fully autonomous driving. Despite how the aids are marketed, drivers are criminally liable for the safe operation of their cars.“The capability of current road vehicle technologies must not be oversold,” said Avery. “Names like Autopilot or ProPilot are deeply unhelpful, as they infer the car can do a lot more than it can. Absolute clarity is needed to help drivers understand the when and how these technologies are designed to work and that they should always remain engaged in the driving task.”Ivan Drury, a senior manager of industry analysis at Edmunds, who was not involved in the report, said that carmakers need to balance the idea that they are pushing the envelope with the drawback of overselling the competencies their systems actually have.“Features such as ABS brakes, cruise control and blindspot detectors are driver aids that are relatively standard across the board from one carmaker to the next however, the varying degrees of ‘autonomy’ that are currently rolling out in the market vary drastically when it comes to the level of engagement required from the driver, what obstacles the system can avoid, how the vehicle corrects itself and more. “Education is critical not only to ensure the safety of consumers, but to pave the way forward for the adoption of these technologies.”Thatcham Research has set out 10 key recommendations for assisted driving technologies, including clear naming, driver engagement monitoring and crash intervention. It is testing a series of systems on cars and will grade them in a report for use by insurers in the autumn.A Tesla spokesperson said: “Tesla has always been clear that Autopilot doesn’t make the car impervious to all accidents and the issues described by Thatcham won’t be a problem for drivers using Autopilot correctly.”A Nissan spokesperson said: “ProPilot Assist is a hands-on, eyes-on, driver-assist system that can be used for motorway and dual carriageway driving. This is clearly communicated to customers at all stages of the purchase process. The system requires the driver to be in control at all times, and with their hands on the steering wheel – the system deactivates if this is not the case.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ab6e137aec22f53629acdd96e8e40fa0c9363a1/0_304_4640_2784/master/4640.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb534450c802887180edbfdd6103bd3e","title":"10 best surf schools in world portugal hawaii south africa norway","story":"What sets these surf schools apart is a commitment to excellence when it comes to tuition, which will help you to catch a wave from Portugal to Hawaii, South Africa to Norway Surf camps provide a taste of the surfing lifestyle and include accommodation and transport, as well as social activities where you can meet other surfers.

At a ceremony in Dublin, where he received an award for making an outstanding contribution to Europe, Kenny also lamented British business’s silence on the matter.His words will come as a sharp rebuke to Brexiters including members of the DUP who have said that if Kenny were still in power there would not be the problems with the Irish border. In March, Jacob Rees-Mogg said “mature” and “responsible” Kenny’s “common sense approach” had been replaced by a “irresponsible vote-catching” Varadkar. His remarks came as Varadkar suggested there could be an extension to article 50 if it looked as if there was no deal in sight. “You’ll know that there are a number of different scenarios that could arise if we’re in a ‘no-deal’ situation. For example, it is possible to extend article 50 to allow more time for negotiations to take place. There is the possibility of an interim deal, or a transition period, pending an outcome or final negotiations over the transition period,” he told TV3. The Irish prime minister said suggestions that the talks go to the wire with a deal sealed in the small hours of the morning were wide of the mark.“I’ve heard some people talking about the possibility of a crunch late-night meeting in Brussels in late October, something akin to a last-minute budget compromise or a fisheries council,” Varadkar added. He said Kenny’s suggestion that there could be an extra summit, perhaps in September, October or even November, to help seal a deal was “helpful”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81dae9744f55355d7e1a38d3a3cdb7bd3dabf5fc/0_352_5464_3279/master/5464.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70766677297866d1bf34e7debb409223","title":"israel to top up sea of galiliee after years of drought","story":"Inland lake where Christians believe Jesus walked on water has reached its lowest level in a century The shrinking Sea of Galilee, the inland lake where Christians believe Jesus walked on water, is to be topped up with desalinated seawater.A plan given Israeli cabinet approval will pump 100 million cubic metres of water annually by 2022 into the lake in the Galilee region, said Yechezkel Lifshitz, from the country’s energy and water ministry.In 2017 Israel’s water authority said the sea, hit by years of drought, had reached its lowest level in a century.Situated 200 metres (656ft) below sea level and 28 miles (45km) from the coast, the Sea of Galilee is mentioned in the bible as the site of a number of Jesus’s miracles.Known in Hebrew as Lake Kinneret, it covers an area of roughly 62 square miles (160 sq km). Ten years ago it provided 400m cubic metres a year of fresh water and was the country’s largest freshwater reserve.But a series of dry winters have reduced its level to such an extent that pumping had to be limited to 30-40m cubic metres a year.He said two more plants would be built to serve the new project: one in the Galilee and another south of Jerusalem. The water would then be pumped into the lake’s tributaries in northern Israel.“We are turning the Kinneret into a reservoir for desalinated water,” said Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister. “This is innovative and important, at least to the extent we are doing this, and has not been done until now.”Lifshitz said that the long-term goal was to pump 1.1bn cubic metres per year by 2030, rising to 1.2bn when needed – at a “relatively high cost”, equivalent to more than $0.70 cents per cubic metre."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d44696e95cde061035b11147918ce9f262ea3eec/106_0_6411_3849/master/6411.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5de1cb0d8c41ba9bbd1d0cc55bf83460","title":"us de facto embassy in taiwan reopens as symbol of strength of ties","story":"US official hails vibrancy of US-Taiwan relationship at relaunch of American Institute in Taiwan after $250m upgradeAmerica’s de facto embassy in Taiwan has reopened after a $250m renovation, with an attending US official hailing the new building as “a symbol of strength and vibrancy” of the relationship between the US and Taiwan.A ceremony at the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) on Tuesday, which took place while the landmark summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore had the world’s attention, was attended by a delegation from Washington that included Marie Royce, the US assistant secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs. Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, several Taiwanese government officials as well as legislators were also present. During the ceremony, US ambassador James Moriarty and Royce reiterated Washington’s commitment to uphold the relationship with Taiwan, calling the new facility “a symbol of strength and vibrancy of the US and Taiwan partnership in the 21st century”.“AIT’s new home is a tangible symbol that reflects the strength of our ties,” said Royce. “It’s a state-of-the-art facility that will make possible even greater cooperation for many years to come.”The ceremony comes at a time when bilateral relations between Beijing and Washington have been severely tested over ongoing trade negotiations and rising tensions in the disputed South China Sea.China has been ramping up pressure on Taiwan since the election in 2016,blocking the self-ruled island from participating in international organisations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and poaching its diplomatic allies. Beijing has also increased the frequency of military exercises in the last few months, including deploying its own aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, in the Taiwan Strait. On Monday night, China’s state-run tabloid Global Times published an editorial, suggesting Beijing should warn the US and Taiwan of possible consequences for any provocative move. “We must draw a red line for the US and Taiwan,” Global Times said through the editorial. “Once crossed, a serious Taiwan Straits crisis will be triggered.”Despite media speculation that Trump would send the new national security advisor John Bolton to the ceremony, the US president exercised restrain. Kharis Templeman, a social science research associate at Stanford University’s Walter H. Shorenstein Asia Pacific research center, said that given the delicate nature of the summit in Singapore, the Trump administration may have chosen not to use the occasion to make a strong symbolic statement.However, Templeman suggested the ceremony should not be interpreted as revealing the Trump administration’s Taiwan policy in general. “High-level visits can be arranged at any time, not just when AIT inaugurates a new building,” Templeman told the . “Any US administration would have made a similar set of statements at the official opening.”The American Institute in Taiwan is not an official embassy, but a non-profit institution established by the US government to represent its interests since Washington switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979 under the One China policy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49d333eb902e104674ddd68922af9be7b7daf424/0_223_4724_2835/master/4724.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63dfc234e93a13de3ab022f35424a23d","title":"poland family life photography exhibition in pictures","story":"Family Values: Polish Photography Now is the UK’s first exhibition focusing on photography from Poland and part of the Calvert 22 Foundation’s season of events examining the country’s visual culture and creative landscape.

He said the woman was currently receiving palliative chemotherapy.Counsel handed in a medical report to the court and he said the woman was in a parlous state.Mr Maher said the case could be listed with the other cases involving CervicalCheck before the High Court as there was an overlap on the experts listed in the cases.Counsel said he appreciated the situation put the court under great strain but the woman could succumb at any moment.Patrick Hanratty SC for the HSE agreed there was an overlap of expert witnesses between the cases.The cases are the first to be listed in the High Court since the CervicalCheck smear controversy arose in April after Limerick woman Vicky Phelan settled her action for €2.5 million.Mr Justice Kevin Cross has already set hearing dates for the end of this month and in July for the other actions.Setting a hearing date for July 20th in the latest case, Mr Justice Kevin Cross congratulated lawyers on all sides for the way they had expedited the work in each of the cases.The cancer-screening controversy emerged two months ago when Vicky Phelan settled for €2.5 million her court action against a US laboratory which the CervicalCheck screening service had subcontracted to read smear tests. Ms Phelan developed cancer after receiving a false negative result in her 2011 smear test.

Photograph: Alan BetsonMore than 1,000 homes in Dublin will lose gardens and parking places under plans by the National Transport Authority to create 16 high-speed bus routes in the city.Under the changes, to be announced today by the authority, 230km of expanded bus lanes and 200km of cycle lanes are to be constructed within a decade.However, the authority warns that because there is “so little unused space” along some roads, that “it will often not be possible to accommodate the bus lanes and cycle lanes in the width available”.The 16 routes are : Clongriffin to city centre Swords to city centre Ballymun to city centre Finglas to Phibsborough Blanchardstown to city centre Lucan to city centre Liffey Valley to city centre Clondalkin to Drimnagh Greenhills to city centre Kimmage to city centre Tallaght to Terenure Rathfarnham to city centre Bray to city centre UCD Ballsbridge to city centre Blackrock to Merrion and Ringsend to city centre.On each of these routes, there will only be one lane for private traffic in and out of the city centre. The “Bus Connects” plan will cost €2 billion and will be completed by 2027.Sections of gardens will be bought by compulsory purchase. The NTA said it will pay for landscaping for the remainder and try to find alternative car parking for affected residents .Some footpaths will be narrowed, while a significant number of trees will also have to be removed where they are in the way of the new bus routes, the reports make clear.Unveiling the €2 billion plan today, the Authority will argue that “tough choices” are needed if the city’s bus network – which carries over two-thirds of all public transport users in the Greater Dublin Area – is to be improved.“There are no longer any simple changes which we can make that would generate meaningful benefits,” the blueprint for the “core bus corridors” project warns. “These are tough changes which cannot, and will not be made lightly.”Sources told The  it is expected that compensation worth “tens of thousands of euro” will be paid for each of an estimated 1,300 front gardens or commercial premises that would be affected.Fine Gael Dublin North-West TD Noel Rock criticised the NTA’s action, saying tens of thousands of home-owners will now fear that they will be affected, not just the 1,300 proposed.“Progress always has a price, but decent communication, transparency and fair treatment of those affected should be essential,” said Mr Rock.

However Dublin North West Fine Gael TD Noel Rock was less enthusiastic, remarking that 1,300 homeowners across Dublin have “not been told” that part of their properties - typically a slice of their front gardens required for road widening - will be acquired by the local authority. Writing to this newspaper Patrick Judge of Dun Laoghaire went so far as to enquire if the plan to “whisk ever more commuters into the city-centre hub and out the other side” was a form of joke. In giving the proposals a broadly warm welcome the Green party said: “For far too long pedestrians and cyclists have been the poor relation in transport planning. Walking and Cycling must be seen as an integral part of the Bus Connects Project” Mr Cuffe, chairman of the City Council’s transport committee, said “cyclists were erted and sidelined” from main Luas routes when that service was commissioned. “This is in danger of happening again. A visible and well-resourced walking and cycling unit must be at the heart of the Bus Connects project,” he said. He also said it was “crucial that both transport users and land-owners are given an opportunity to have their views inform the planning process” and that it may be possible to further restrict cars in the city, rather than engaging in road widening. The Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said the proposals contain “positive opportunities, for cleaner air, safer streets, calmer and more affordable journeys,” delivering a “cleaner healthier, happier city is worth it” he said. However, Mr Rock said he was astonished that the National Transport Authority intended to announce the plan “yet have not informed residents affected, and have no plans to do so before then. “Similarly, their own report doesn’t outline exactly which properties will be affected by the acquisition rather it only outlines the roads affected”. Mr Rock said the failure to contact specific property owners “means instead of 1,300 households being informed on this matter” fears will be raised “by a multiple of several times that.” Mr Rock continued: “This is deeply disappointing from the NTA, and displays the exact same mistakes made in the recent Link Emerging Preferred Route announcement with Na Fianna, Home Farm FC, Scoil Mobhí, Scoil Chaitríona and other local organisations and residents affected either being told very late or not at all. “This is unacceptable and I call on the NTA to remedy this before any public announcements on the matter. “I have also written to the chair of the Oireachtas Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport to invite the NTA in to discuss this: progress always has a price, but decent communication, transparency and fair treatment of those affected should be an essential part of any development.” Dublin Chamber said “it can take around one hour to travel as little as six kilometres in the city”. “Our research has identified that Dubliners see a consistent commute time of 30 minutes as being desirable and achievable for journeys within the M50. “The delivery of projects such as Bus Connects, as well as Link, Dart Underground and segregated cycle lanes, are key to that sweet spot being hit,” said spokesman Graeme McQueen.He said that timely delivery of the Bus Connects project is essential if the recent progress in getting people to switch to sustainable transport modes is to be maintained."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3527772.1528802054!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"british minister resigns over irresponsible brexit strategy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA file image  Phillip Lee who resigned as Justice minister on Tuesday. Photograph: AFP British prime minister Theresa May has suffered a ministerial resignation ahead of crunch Commons votes on Brexit, with Phillip Lee hitting out at the Government’s “irresponsible” approach.Remain-supporting Dr Lee quit as justice minister on Tuesday, saying he could not support “how our country’s exit from the EU looks set to be delivered”.He said his main objection to government policy was over the “wish to limit parliament’s role in contributing to the final outcome” and signalled he would rebel on the issue in the Commons later.Dr Lee also called for the government’s final proposals to be put to the public in a second referendum.“When the government is able to set out an achievable, clearly defined path, one that has been properly considered, whose implications have been foreseen, and that is rooted in reality and evidence, not dreams and dogma, it should go to the people, once again, to seek their confirmation,” he wrote.The issue of a “meaningful vote” is set to be a flashpoint in the Commons, with ministers seeking to overturn a Lords amendment which would give Parliament extensive powers to direct ministers how to proceed if a deal with Brussels is rejected by MPs or no deal is reached.The government’s compromise is that a minister would come to the House within 28 days of a deal being rejected to tell MPs what will happen next, but an amendment tabled by former attorney general Dominic Grieve would insist on a binding Commons motion.Dr Lee, who represents the Leave-voting Bracknell seat, said in a lengthy resignation statement: “Our parliament should be able to direct our government to change course in our interests.“In all conscience, I cannot support the Government’s decision to oppose this amendment because doing so breaches such fundamental principles of human rights and parliamentary sovereignty.“A vote between bad and worse is not a meaningful vote. And I cannot bring myself to vote for it in the bastion of liberty, freedom and human rights that is our Parliament.”Dr Lee added: “If Brexit is worth doing, then it is certainly worth doing well regardless of how long that takes. It is, however, irresponsible to proceed as we are.”A Downing Street source said: “We will get a good Brexit deal that works for everybody in the UK.“The government’s amendment today provides for a meaningful vote.”Dr Lee’s shock departure came as David Davis warned potential Tory rebels that they cannot undo the EU referendum, ahead of a tricky 48 hours in which the government will try to get its Brexit programme back on track.“A meaningful vote is not the ability to reverse the decision of the referendum, he told BBC Radio 4’s Today.“We will put in front of parliament the decision for them to vote ... after that there will be a process of primary legislation to put the actual details of it in parliament, so parliament will actually decide on the application of the detail.”Asked what would happen if they voted against the deal, he said: “If they throw it out, well, they throw it out. We will have to go away, think about it and come back and make a statement, which is what I am saying to the House this afternoon.”However, Devon Tory Sarah Wollaston signalled on Tuesday morning that she would back Mr Grieve’s amendment.Dismissing the Government’s compromise, she tweeted: “Merely issuing a statement in response would make it a meaningless final vote.“Grieve’s amendment puts that right and in a way Govt could and should accept it.”She said unless there was a “meaningful vote” parliament would be left with “the grim choice between a poor deal and exit with no deal at all”.It would also give hard Brexiteers the chance to “scupper a good deal”, she claimed.The prime minister appeared to have defused a potentially explosive row over the EU customs union on Monday night as Tory pro-Europe rebels Sir Oliver Letwin and Nicky Morgan and Brexiteers Jacob Rees-Mogg and Sir Bill Cash came together to table a separate compromise amendment backing “a customs arrangement” with the EU.Government sources signalled that ministers were set to back the move.However, the compromise is only likely to delay a full-blown showdown on the customs union until trade legislation returns to the Commons in July. - PA Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"magnum freedom project pictures","story":"1968 was a seismic year of deep societal and political shifts.

It is hoped that children will again be taught there.This road will transform life on Sanday, she said. No ordinary vehicles could use the old track because of the clearance needed and only get around along the foreshore when the tide is out.The road will give 24 hour access and is also vital for a new renewable energy scheme which will start producing electricity in a few months.The new road stretches from the Canna bridge to a church on the island.The original track would often be submerged under water at high tideAlongside the track, the trust wants to create a trail to link the sites of interest on Sanday together. These include the bridge itself, the shrine, machair and sand dunes, bird colonies, St Edward\u0027s Church, Sanday lighthouse and local archaeology.Canna is just over four miles long and one mile wide.

New research suggests a vital link between our ability to sense our physical bodies and knowing how we feelStephen has been married twice. Two wedding days. Two “I do”s. Yet Stephen has no happy memories from either – or, in fact, from the marriages or any of his relationships.\u0026nbspHe met his first wife on a pre-nursing course when he was just 16. Six years later, they were married. Three years after that, they got orced she was never really the right one for him, he says.Almost two decades on, in 2009, he met his second wife through a dating site. He threw himself into the relationship and, the following year, with his father and her two adult siblings present, they married at the registrar’s office in Sheffield, where they both live.\u0026nbspHe put on smiles for the wedding photos because he recognised that they were expected but, as he explains: “From an inner feeling point of view, anything I do that requires an emotional response feels like a fake.“Most of my responses are learned responses. In an environment where everyone is being jolly and happy, it feels like I’m lying. Acting. Which I am. So it is a lie.”\u0026nbspHappiness isn’t the only emotion that Stephen struggles with. Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”People without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

Andy Martin on the man who’ll be guiding ITV viewers through a month of World Cup hyperboleEverybody is a commentator these days. @Chasepacheco1, for example, who tweeted after last month’s Uefa Champions League final:\u0026nbsp“My Liverpool team fought hard and I’m proud of them. Except for Karius, he can die in a hole.” Loris Karius, Liverpool’s German goalkeeeper, let in three goals (one of them, to be fair, a moment of sheer brilliance by Gareth Bale). Which means that online he finds himself denounced as a “Nazi”. And, according to one theory, paid handsomely for his “howlers” by Real Madrid. We can assume that the World Cup in Russia this month will be the occasion of a deluge of similar wildly overheated rhetoric, hyperbole and death threats.But you won’t be hearing any of it from ITV’s chief football commentator Clive Tyldesley. Winner many times over of the Royal Television Society Sports Commentator of the Year award, he is the voice of moderation, the calm centre at the eye of the storm. Occasionally the target of Twitter rage himself, he expects to encounter not just a lot of verbals but also racism, hooliganism, and misogyny on top. Football, he says, is “warts and all. It reflects life. It corrupts. That is part of its fascination.” But, from the heights of the commentary box, he tries to provide something like a counterpoint to all the frenzy, the agony and the ecstasy.He is a fit-looking 63 and described himself as “a respecter of vocabulary” when I went to see him shortly before the Champions League final. “I would never say it’s a ‘disaster’ or a ‘tragedy’ if the ball goes through the goalkeeper’s legs,” he said. “You only use words like that if somebody dies.” He thought he might stretch to “calamity”.\u0026nbspHis words were strangely prophetic. As it turned out that is exactly the word he selected to describe Liverpool’s “goalkeeping calamity” when Karius bowled the ball right onto the toe of Benzema. But it struck me that there was also a kind of poetry, of a restrained, austere kind, in his summary of Real Madrid’s first goal, perhaps something like an instant haiku:And Real Madrid are in front.His “an evening that had started so promisingly for Liverpool” sounded a poignantly elegiac note. I also had to admire the comment, after Karius lets a tame one by Bale slip through his hands and into the net: “His reputation would do well to survive that moment.” Note the use of the conditional tense. Tyldesley appreciates that the keeper’s reputation is already in tatters, but that – perhaps in an ideal world – it could still recover.David Hume said that you cannot get an “ought” from an “is”. Somehow Clive Tyldesley manages to pull that off. He is only describing a game of football but there is an implicit ethics in his commentary. Tyldesley agrees with Bill Shankly that football is not a matter of life and death, but omits the punchline, “it’s more important than that.” Still, it is “a huge emotional investment by all the people who turn on. They choose to watch.” Therefore, as a commentator, “You have to be careful with your use of words.”The Playstation Schools Cup U15 final, between Thomas Telford School and Carshalton Boys Sports College, held at Reading’s Madejski stadium, was as fraught and intense as any Champions League final. Some of the players even had agents already. “Maybe overdid it a bit, Hodnett,” commented Tyldesley, in his simultaneous schools broadcast, as he skyed the ball over the bar. He prepared for this game as scrupulously as he is now preparing for the opening game of the World Cup between Russia and Saudi Arabia, and had a foolscap file in front of him containing assorted facts about the players.There was a goalmouth melee, which saw both the Carshalton goalkeeper and the Telford player red-carded. And a penalty shootout after the much fancied Telford came back from 2-0 down only to blow it on the last kick of the game. “Now that is absolutely out of order,” said Tyldesley, as the hulking No 10 wrapped a menacing paw around the referee. “He’d have done well to keep his opinions to himself.” It’s advice he has tried to follow.But in a sense all of his commentary implies an opinion. Presumably he would have disapproved of Zinedine Zidane’s farewell headbutt on Marco Materazzi in 2006 and David Beckham’s retaliation on Diego Simeone that got him sent off in 1998. Tyldesley himself doesn’t get flustered. He is unflappable. He has – and admires – grace under pressure. “His control wasn’t the best,” as he said in one of his critical remarks about the U15 final. The ability to take and keep control is all important, whether you’re on the pitch or off it.This might have something to do with having been subjected to the furious “hairdryer” treatment from Sir Alex Ferguson when still manager of Manchester United, not just once but twice. “You really can feel your hair blowing backwards.” He thought that the boot that hit David Beckham in the face in the dressing room was “probably an accident”.Whether it’s broadcasting to schools or to 10 million people on ITV, Tyldesley always feels a sense of “responsibility”. “Balance” is a key word. He points out that the dying words of Pheidippedes, the messenger who ran all the way from Marathon to Athens to report on the outcome of the battle back in 490BC, “We won!”, only caused confusion, because people were bound to ask, “Who is ‘we’?” “He wasn’t a good journalist,” says Tyldesley. “What he should have said is ‘Athens won’.” Greece 1, Persia 0.He was once commentating on an England-Scotland game with Ron Atkinson when Atkinson insisted on saying “we”. Tyldesley said to him, “You should say ‘England’ not ‘we’.” Although he accepts that there perhaps he was being “correct beyond reason”. He allows that the occasional we “might slip out” at the World Cup. “I’m English but I’m still objective. You don’t choose to support England. It would be odd to switch to supporting Chile.”Tyldesley disapproves of those who get too fancy. “A straightforward pass would have done,” is a classic line of his, which happened to be addressed to schools. So too when it comes to commentary. He argues that cricket and golf have passages of inaction which permit – or even demand – “colour”, the kind of lyrical and expansive discourse, infinitely digressive, forever associated with John Arlott and Brian Johnston in cricket or Peter Alliss in golf. Steve Bunce likewise in boxing, and I can get similarly carried away when it comes to describing surfing, perhaps because there are often long lulls between the epic and the awesome.Tyldesley is more a fan of plain speaking. He says the best ad slogan of all time is Ronseal’s “Does exactly what it says on the tin”. That’s how he thinks commentary should be. You observe, you analyse, you try not to hype it up. You keep it “succinct”. “There’s no point trying to be Wordsworth or Browning. As Barry Davis once said, “One man’s commentator is another man’s pain in the arse.”Everything is mediated and mediatised. There are no exceptions. The old Zen koan, “If a tree fell over in the forest and no one was there to witness it would you still hear it?” now has a clear answer. Yes, because it would be captured by a passing drone or on satellite TV, blazed all over Instagram, tweeted about furiously, the tree’s friends on Facebook would start a crowdfunding campaign, and it would shortly thereafter be the subject of a controversial Channel 4 documentary. Nothing happens any more without commentary. But this is and always has been especially true of football. “They think it’s all over… it is now”, Kenneth Wolstenholme’s line, is as memorable as the 1966 World Cup final itself. Whether or not the ball crossed the line is less significant now than the fact that there was so much debate about whether or not it had. And new technology is not making the debate go away, rather the opposite.I can’t play football without also hearing something like this in my head:\u0026nbsp “Martin comes on, scores with his first touch, and the crowd goes wild.” As Simon Critchley, philosopher and (currently distraught) Liverpool fan comments in his book, What We Think About When We Think About Football, “We usually know football through commentary, through largely, and hugely, inane commentary.”Tyldesley doesn’t think of it as inane. “Sometimes,” he says, “‘a game of two halves’ is exactly what it is. You can’t improve on it.” If he were to write a book about it, it would be something like the opposite of Nick Hornby’s Fever Pitch. Hornby is all about irrational fandom, ritual, intensity of feeling. Tyldesley is more of a phlegmatic “keep calm and carry on” sort of guy. “We don’t need to see that!” he exclaimed at the sight of an overflow of emotions on the sidelines with even teachers getting hot under the collar.Albert Camus said, “I learned everything I know about morality from football.” Which is to say, when it comes to the “beautiful game”, the good, the bad, and the ugly are all on display. There are undoubtedly heroes and villains in Tyldesley’s narrative. But he does it subtly. “You try not to sound too much like a Methodist preacher,” as he puts it. When it comes to making criticism of the play – you could call it a judo throw – by Sergio Ramos, the Real Madrid captain, that resulted in Mo Salah going off in agony with a dislocated shoulder, Tyldesley is judicious but still uncompromising in his remarks. There is “a coming together with Ramos that only he can fully explain”. As he goes up to collect the cup, Ramos is described as “not everyone’s idea of a model professional – maybe nobody’s”.There is even an implicit politics in his commentary. Tyldesley has no objection to big money in football. “It’s labour intensive, they’re entitled to be paid. You can’t do without inidual players.” But still “the collective should be stronger than the inidual”. And this is where we went so badly wrong in the Brexit campaign, and the adjacent media coverage, he argues. “We turned it into a personality competition. Instead of providing the relevant information, we focused on the impact it would have on the lives of politicians.”He says that “the most popular team in this country is not Manchester United or Liverpool, it’s England. It’s a great democracy.” And he has to be “inclusive”. He would never use the word “esoteric” for example, he says, because he doesn’t “want anyone to have to get up and look for a dictionary”.When I saw him, Tyldesley was prepping Arabic and Russian names. He says, “I will try to get it correct, but I will not make sounds we don’t make in the English language.” When identifying James Rodriguez of Chile in the past, he wanted to say “James”.\u0026nbspEventually he bowed to pressure from Twitter to say “Ham-es”, in the Spanish manner. “But later I learned that his father,\u0026nbspa 007 fan,\u0026nbsphad named him after James Bond.”\u0026nbspHe felt vindicated, because in Spanish-speaking countries it’s always James, never Ham-es, Bond.\u0026nbspHe is not, he reckons, “responsible for the teaching of Spanish” or Arabic or Russian.In an extremist, Dionysian world, Tyldesley is an Apollonian voice of reason. He holds the mirror up to football with minimum distortion, minimum fuss. Sound without the fury. A degree zero of poetry. Let’s hope he doesn’t have to repeat a line he first used of England versus Iceland in 2016, “This is the most abject failure that I can recall.”Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’.

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.This is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Standing in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Below, a square hole in the rock floor denotes a sacrificial spot from the time of the Dedanites. Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen. We’re not finding it close to the surface, it’s above surface, well and truly visible.”Deploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra. It was built using stones from those cities. They can be seen fortifying the occasional doorway.Ahmed leads the way down an empty street to the house where his parents used to live – collapsed beams, upturned crates. He shows me the mosque, erected over the spot where the Prophet Mohammed stopped in 630AD, and with a goat bone drew in the sand the direction of Medina Ahmed’s uncle was the last imam.And a modern inscription: the name “Charles”, scratched on the oat-coloured mud wall not, as momentarily I’d hoped, by Charles Doughty, but by Prince Charles (in 2015, with his key), and below it the Islamic translation.During the Islamic period, Al-Ula, or El-Ally as Doughty knew it, became an important station on the haj road south, and marked the last place where Christians were permitted to travel.\u0026nbspIbn Battuta described how pilgrim caravans paused here for four days to resupply and wash, and to leave any excess baggage with the townspeople “who are known for their trustworthiness”.“I hope we are still doing our best to be like that,” Ahmed says. “You can try, if you want, to leave something.”The only thing I left behind after my four days here was an urge to come back.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

That\u0027s why it\u0027s not even fun to me anymore.\u0026nbspWhen the interviewer suggested that more topics are off limits now, Push replied: Bro, it\u0027s weird. It\u0027s so weird. There\u0027s a sentimental aspect that I didn\u0027t know existed. But new rules. I\u0027m learning and discovering a whole bunch of new rules in the rap game. And I\u0027ll just leave it at that.The feud\u0026nbspwas reignited by T\u0027s DAYTONA album track, \u0027Infrared\u0027.

In doing so, they hope to understand the chemical and physical properties of GEMS that have been present in our solar system for millennia.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Sending vulnerable victims of trafficking back to the place they were trafficked from risks pushing them straight back into modern slavery,” she told The Independent.“It also means that victims won’t come forward or ask for help for fear of being sent straight back again. Instead of tackling modern slavery, this risks strengthening the power of the traffickers.”Labour MP Vernon\u0026nbspCoaker, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on human trafficking and modern slavery, said the current policy was “outrageous” and “totally and utterly unacceptable”.“Immigration policy seems to be riding roughshod over the needs of victims of trafficking. With much of this we’re talking about confirmed victims. These are not people who are playing the system, they are cases where the Home Office themselves have said these are victims of some of the most serious crimes,” he said.“It’s going to put people off coming forward, and it’s going to undermine the government’s own strategy on cracking down on trafficking and modern slavery. If the government is true to its rhetoric around supporting modern slavery victims, this would not be happening.”The Home Office accepted that Mr Nguyen was a victim of trafficking last August. He was released on bail last year and relocated in Glasgow, where he began volunteering for a number of charities, but he was detained again last Monday and issued the deportation notice.He is currently being held in Colnbrook detention centre, in Harmondsworth, awaiting deportation on Thursday.Describing his trafficking ordeal, Mr Nguyen said: “I worked but I had no money. I knew nothing about cannabis. They told me they couldn’t sell it because my skills to cultivate it were so poor.“When I realised it was illegal, in my mind I had a plan to escape\u0026nbspbut I couldn’t\u0026nbspbecause they are gangsters and part of an underground group.\u0026nbsp“They would come in and open the door and then leave again. I had to wake up after midnight to turn on and off the lights and to water the cannabis. I often had to stay up overnight.“I couldn’t get out. The house lacked oxygen – all the windows and the doors had live power on them so I would get electric shocks if I tried to open them.”Eight months into the exploitation, police raided the property and Mr Nguyen was arrested and sentenced to 15 months in prisonThe Vietnamese national described his imprisonment as “hard, but better than\u0026nbspgrowing cannabis,” adding: “I felt more freedom in prison.”Expressing his fear of deportation, the Vietnamese national said: “I feel very nervous. I don’t know what will happen to me in the future. I would be scared to go back because the gangsters will be out to get me. If I was to return I fear I will be killed.”Mr Nguyen’s situation has prompted a renewed push for changes to legislation to ensure adequate\u0026nbspsupport is\u0026nbspprovided to modern slavery victims, after a report by the National Audit Office urged there was\u0026nbsp“much more to do” to ensure victims in the UK are protected.At\u0026nbsppresent,\u0026nbsppeople who are officially recognised to have been trafficked through the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) – the UK’s official framework for identifying victims of human trafficking –\u0026nbspreceive no long-term support or automatic immigration status in the UK.Janet Fisher, advocacy manager and a solicitor at anti-slavery charity Hope for Justice, said the number of victims the organisation was seeing being threatened with deportation was “definitely increasing”, and claimed the issue was an as yet uncovered element of the hostile environment policies.She told of one client who\u0026nbspwas recently taken from their safe house, which is\u0026nbspwhere trafficking victims stay after they are rescued,\u0026nbspby immigration enforcement officers in order to carry out their deportation. The removal was later halted after\u0026nbsplawyers intervened.“We’ve had a number of trafficking victims who have been deported and then been pursued by their captors and fled straight back again. It’s a growing problem. It’s one of a number of things which are happening in the hostile environment but are only anecdotal at this point because they haven’t come to light,” said Ms Fisher.“We know that traffickers are mentioning the threat of deportation when they are exploiting people as a way of keeping control. One man was shown his own house on Google Earth by his trafficker to show they knew where he lived, so didn’t want to report the abuse out of fear. There are genuine threats to people.“The government must focus their immigration efforts on the people doing the trafficking, not the victims. But we know there have been many more victims facing deportation than traffickers.”Bhaveshri Patel-Chandegra, a solicitor from Duncan Lewis who is representing Mr Nguyen, said: “So many people get put off reporting because word gets around and they think if this is how I’m going to be treated, why should I claim?“There needs to be a change in the policy. People are being recognised as victims but then left without status. They’re left with nothing. What’s the point in being recognised as a victim if they’re not going to have any kind of support?”Kate Roberts, head of the Human Trafficking Foundation, echoed the concerns, saying: “There is a conflict between the immigration enforcement and the rehabilitation and victims’ needs, and supporting people to ensure they have a chance to rebuild their lives and not be re-trafficked.\u0026nbsp“It’s symptomatic of the huge focus on immigration control and its prevalence above everything else.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “We do not routinely comment on inidual cases.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

You’ve been a stain on this country’s character for decades. I’m not interested in your bullying. I will do what I believe to be best for the country and people I love.”\u0026nbspChuka Umunna, the Labour MP for Streatham, pointed to both front pages with the comment: “These people think they can intimidate and threaten members of parliament. These threats, as Parliament considers the biggest issue facing us since the Second World War, are a real and present danger to our democracy. This is 2018 not the 1930s.”\u0026nbspConservative MP Anna Soubry, one of the leading pro-EU Tory rebels, referred to a quote from Winston Churchill: “Courage is rightly esteemed the first of human qualities, because, as has been said, ‘it is the quality which guarantees all others’”.\u0026nbspThe remarks come as Theresa May prepares herself for a potentially bruising 48 hours in the Commons in order to get her flagship Brexit legislation back on track and remove 14 out of 15 amendments added to the bill by peers in the Lords.\u0026nbspAddressing a meeting of the backbench 1922 Committee on Monday, ahead of the key votes, the Prime Minister said: “We must think about the message Parliament will send to the European Union this week.”I am trying to negotiate the best deal for Britain. I am confident I can get a deal that allows us to strike our own trade deals while having a border with the EU which is as frictionless as possible.“But if the Lords amendments are allowed to stand, that negotiating position will be undermined.”Ms May looks set to avoid a humiliating defeat on a vote scheduled for Wednesday on the customs union. A number of potential pro-EU Conservative rebels, as well as leading Brexiteers, have now agreed to back a No 10 deal.\u0026nbspBut the government remains vulnerable to a damaging defeat on a “meaningful vote” amendment which would hand Parliament a decisive say over what happens next if it rejects a final Brexit deal. A compromise amendment on the issue has been put forward by the pro-EU rebel Dominic Grieve but the government is yet to declare whether they will be supporting it.\u0026nbspLabour’s Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, wrote in the  on Tuesday: “Instead of negotiating for Britain, the Prime Minister is lurching from crisis to crisis, increasing the risk that the talks break down, and we crash out without an agreement.

Mr Corbyn has ordered his MPs\u0026nbspto abstain on the matter.That decision prompted fury among pro-Europe\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspin his party, at least 70 of whom are understood to be ready\u0026nbspto defy their\u0026nbspleader in order to vote for the amendment.The Independent understands several ministers and\u0026nbspfrontbench\u0026nbspaides are among the potential rebels, raising the prospect of them either resigning or being sacked.\u0026nbspIn a\u0026nbspletter seen by The Independent, the MPs from pro-Brexit constituencies tell Mr Corbyn not to budge on his commitment to leaving the European Economic Area.\u0026nbsp“We appreciate the significant efforts that you and Keir Starmer, along with his shadow DExEU team, have undertaken to ensure that Labour’s policy reflects our manifesto commitment to accessing the benefits of the single market, whilst acknowledging that freedom of movement must end when we leave the European Union,” they write.“However, we are aware that some Labour MPs believe the Labour Party should back Lord Alli’s amendment, which would seek to maintain Britain within the single market as a member of the EEA.“We will not be supporting the EEA amendment later this week.”They add: “Staying in the\u0026nbspEEA\u0026nbspwhilst outside the European Union would be the opposite of what the public voted for. There would be a huge democratic deficit, as the UK became a ‘rule taker,’ not a ‘rule maker’.”“Crucially, despite suggestions to the contrary,\u0026nbspEEA\u0026nbspmembership would require accepting free movement of Labour. Concerns about free movement were an important factor which drove our constituents to vote Leave,\u0026nbspand almost half of all Remain voters wanted changes to free movement. We do not believe these concerns should be ignored.”The letter was coordinated by Stoke-on-Trent Central MP Gareth Snell, Stoke-on-Trent North’s Ruth Smeeth, shadow justice minister Gloria De Piero\u0026nbspand former minister Caroline Flint.It comes as a\u0026nbspdirect response to claims by pro-Europe MPs\u0026nbspthat there would be a parliamentary majority in favour of the UK joining the EEA\u0026nbspif Labour backed it. That suggestion infuriated\u0026nbspLabour MPs\u0026nbspfrom Leave areas, who have made clear they would never vote in favour of EEA membership because it is likely to mean the continuation of freedom of movement – something unacceptable to many of their constituents. Some MPs fear the issue is already costing Labour support among working-class voters.One shadow cabinet source told\u0026nbspThe Independent: “People like Chris and\u0026nbspChuka\u0026nbsphave been saying ‘if only the Labour\u0026nbspfront bench\u0026nbspgot behind the\u0026nbspEEA, we’d win the vote hands down’. That definitely got a reaction from people who were saying, ‘Well, I wouldn’t vote for the\u0026nbspEEA’. There were a couple of\u0026nbspPLP\u0026nbspmeetings where it was very clear that people felt just as strongly against the\u0026nbspEEA\u0026nbspas they did for the\u0026nbspEEA.”In their letter, the MPs\u0026nbspwrite: “We would also be unlikely to support any future amendment which seeks to keep the UK in the EEA after we have left the European Union, and would not support any change in Labour policy to that effect.“We believe the amendment tabled in your name to the Lords amendment, which is supported by the majority of the PLP, more appropriately reflects Labour policy.”While at least 70 Labour MPs\u0026nbspare expected to rebel against the party line in order to vote in favour of the EEA amendment, others plan to defy instructions and vote\u0026nbspagainst it, causing a major breakdown in discipline as\u0026nbspLabour MPs\u0026nbspsplit\u0026nbspthree ways on the same motion.Sir Keir\u0026nbspStarmer, the shadow Brexit secretary,\u0026nbsphas been holding regular meetings with Labour\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspfrom Leave-backing constituencies\u0026nbspto listen\u0026nbspto their concerns. At one such meeting last week,\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspare understood to have emphasised the need for the party to stand firm in opposing a deal that would allow continued freedom of movement.Some\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspfrom Leave-voting areas believe their voice has not been fully heard in the public debate and has instead been overshadowed by more vocal pro-EU colleagues dominating the media. The letter is, in part, an attempt to change this.Mr Snell told The Independent: “This is a private letter being discussed with colleagues in town and coalfield seats where voterse supported leaving the EU.“But we are all clear that the EEA is not the model which would work for our communities and would be unacceptable to our colleagues. It is quite clear that the strength of feeling in the PLP is such that even if a dozen Tories were to vote to support the EEA, a majority of Labour MPs would not do the same.”The split\u0026nbspcentres on a cross-party motion passed by the House of Lords that would keep Britain in the EEA – in effect, the single market. MPs\u0026nbspwill vote on the amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill when the bill returns to the Commons on Wednesday.Labour has refused to support the amendment, with Mr Corbyn having insisted remaining in the EEA would be “not appropriate”. In a bid to offset a backbench\u0026nbsprebellion, the Labour leadership\u0026nbsphas instead tabled its own amendment that would see Britain retain “full access”\u0026nbspto the single market but not join the EEA.The internal row exploded in public on Sunday, when Chris Leslie, a vocal pro-Europe MP, accused Ms Flint of behaviour like leading Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg.\u0026nbspHe told the BBC’s Sunday Politics: “The vast majority of Labour members, supporters, voters, all the polling shows ...\u0026nbspwant to stay in the single market because they know in their workplaces, this is going to matter.“Caroline is starting to sound a little bit like Jacob Rees-Mogg with the sort of notion that we should almost go for Brexit at all costs.”Ms Flint hit back: “I think when you are losing the argument, you go to desperate accusations.“I think we are caught in a situation between hardline Brexiteers and hardline Remainers, many of whom want to overturn the referendum result.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Thats how serious I was about getting that job.Kazi then found business success after launching perfume company Sunnamusk, but for the past two and a half years, hes been focused on his real dream: starting an airline.Breaking into the airline business is a monumental challenge for anyone, but Kazi has no industry experience at all - and hes dead set on keeping to his religious morals.Malaysian carrier Rayani Air is an example of a Sharia airline - although it was shut down in 2016Kazis chief adviser, veteran aviation consultant John Brayford, has been concerned about the feasibility of Kazis Sharia business plan from the start.If you look at the airlines around the world that dont serve alcohol, theres not one of them which can be considered successful, John says.But Kazi was always reluctant to budge on his principles, even when he attracted a barrage of hateful online comments from Islamophobic trolls who made jibes about kamikaze pilots and making stopovers in Islamic State territory.However, he has recently decided that his controversial Sharia angle has turned into a PR headache - so hes started to tone it down a bit while courting passengers and investors.The entrepreneur told Sun Online: When you say Sharia compliance, people will take it as Sharia enforcement, which isnt the case.But were trying to position ourselves to Islamic investors. Theres obviously the halal food and then modest dressing - I dont believe in exploiting women to get more business.There will be no alcohol but we will try to use substitutes.The under-experienced and overenthusiastic businessman dreams of flying long-haul to the Middle East, but first he needs to establish some short-haul routes to make a name for his airline and earn some money.In the documentary, we follow Kazi as he opens negotiations to fly out of Londons Ashford Airport and Waterford Airport in Ireland.Normally, airlines pay airports a fee in return for being allowed to fly from them, but wheeler-dealer Kazi was audacious enough to demand that the airports should be paying Firnas.With this unorthodox request, Kazi gets a firm no and negotiations collapse, forcing his ego to make an emergency landing.But it turns out that Kazi, banking on his negotiations going well, had already signed a £60,000-a-month lease on a 72-seater turboprop plane, egged on by business partner and fellow Bangladeshi Abdul Roqueb.He may be used to cleaning toilets, but Kazi had never been in it that deep before.The would-be airline boss was paying thousands for his plane to sit on the tarmac, with nowhere to fly it and his credibility in tatters.Still haemorrhaging money, Kazi cancelled the lease on his pricey 72-seater and returned to the drawing board, where he decided that flying short commuter hops are his only hope if he wants to break into the notoriously change-averse airline business.With nothing to show for two years work, it was time to go plane shopping again - but this time Kazi had to dial down his enthusiasm, and act a bit less like a kid in a sweet shop.On the show, we see him poking around a much smaller 19-seater Jetstream plane - a sturdy little craft but a world away from the long-haul Dreamliner Kazi wants to see in Firnas colours.Hes clearly underwhelmed by the tired-looking upholstery and creaking seats, and he knows that his hopes of flying to the Middle East couldnt be further away.That hole there, says Kazi to the planes pilot and owner, as he inspects the wing. Is that meant to be there?Raging at his team, Kazi adds: This is not the plan. Every decision we make we have to go right back to the bottom. Its going on and on and costing me money every day.But he has no choice. If he wants to start an airline, he has to start small - and in this business, the Jetstream, at a cost of £8,500 a month, is as small as it gets.Today, it finally looks as if Firnas first aircraft is ready to fly - and Kazis journey from plane cleaner to plane owner is complete.Kazi has raised around £500,000, money which will be used to lease planes and cover the many costs of getting set up.His nifty little Jetstream plane has been painted in a fetching shade of Firnas purple, and is ready to be sent on short commuter runs between UK cities.And despite the online backlash, Kazi is still committed to filling the gap in the market for an Islamic airline.Its about brand positioning - its about being different and sticking out from the crowd, a chirpy Kazi tells us.We want to be a premium airline. Not your low-cost Easyjet or Ryanair.Firnas is now just months away from operating its first commercial charter flights, as soon as all the regulatory hurdles have been cleared.From then, Kazi estimates, long-haul flights should be just two or three years down the line.What were doing will be a game changer, he insists.It may well be, but dont hold your breath for that celebratory glass of bubbly when Firnas Airways finally does take off - you wont be allowed to drink it anyway.How To Start an Airline airs at 10.30pm on Channel 4 on Wednesday. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She should confirm this week what she wants from Brussels — no ifs, no buts and no more compromises.If EU bosses think we’re not ready to go it alone, they’ll offer us the thinnest gruel — and we’ll have to take it. They’re already warning that if we want a trade agreement we’ll have to accept free movement.

The whole thing is keeping Theresa May so busy that she hasnt even had time to check in to this years Love Island villa at all.As the EU Withdrawal Bill returns to the House of Commons for a series of knife-edge votes today and tomorrow, weve got some help for the Love Island ladies to understand whats really going on in our fight to quit the EU...In short, Hayley, Britain is leaving the European Union.In a historic vote in 2016 Brits voted to throw off the shackles of Brussels and go it alone, taking back control of our money, borders and laws.We officially kicked off the process in March 2017, and Theresa May now has less than a year to negotiate with the EU just how were going to leave, and whats happening next.But, to be honest, its not going all that well for her lately.Last week her Brexit secretary David Davis almost quit over controversial plans for Northern Ireland, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson started mouthing off about the Government at a private dinner and he even said that Donald Trump could get a better deal with the EU.Not ideal. Mrs May needs the next few days to go a bit smoother or she will face more calls to kick her out and replace her with someone new.The EU Withdrawal Bill is absolutely vital to make sure Britain is ready for Brexit.It will transfer all existing EU laws into British law, so there are no gaps after we finally quit the bloc.In essence, its proof to the European Union that we really are leaving and were getting on with it.So come on, lets start talking trade!And if Brussels think the PM is being dictated to by her own MPs it will make Britain look weak at the negotiating table, where were fighting for a decent trade deal.Theresa May needs to win to show shes under control.We must be in a strong position to get what we want - and these votes could bind the PMs hands completely.So far its gone through the House of Commons and passed through to the Lords with just one change to it.Now meddling peers have slapped on a whopping 15 changes to it, which if passed would tell Mrs May what to do in Brussels.These have nothing to do with the EU Bill itself - all this is about is putting EU laws into Britains books.Lords - many of whom voted to Remain - want to water the Bill down and change it to how they want.And if they could, many of them would opt to keep us in the EU after all.Peers in the upper chamber have changed Mrs Mays Bill several times which is causing her huge problems.The main one is on the customs union - which would force the Government to negotiate with the EU to keep Britain in the customs union after Brexit.That would help trade flow freely between the EU and the UK - but would also stop Britain striking new trade deals with the rest of the world, removing one of Brexit’s main advantages.Although it would not necessarily keep the UK in the customs union, it would make that outcome much more likely.Theres a chance this one could pass, leaving Mrs May weak and defeated.Perhaps the most damaging amendment for the Government’s Brexit plan is a motion to propel Britain into the European Economic Area.The EEA - which includes Norway and Iceland - incorporates the single market, so joining it would force us to continue free movement of people and keep most European laws. That wont fly with most Leavers.Some of the other changes include scrapping Brexit Day altogether (when we will finally exit the bloc), hanging on to EU rights, keeping our borders open to refugees and giving MPs the power to decide what happens if they vote down her final Brexit deal.The Government has also accepted several amendments to the Bill - including that the courts should refer to European Court of Justice judgements when relevant and clarifying the status of retained EU laws after exit dayThe Bill comes back for two days to the House of Commons on Tuesday and Wednesday.They are set to have six hours to debate the changes each day, and then vote on whether to accept or reject them.The debate is expected to kick off around lunchtime, with the crunch votes at around 4pm and 7pm.The meaningful vote amendment is set to be voted on today, and tomorrow on the customs union.Most of them Mrs May is set to win - as they do have a majority in the House of Commons with the help of her coalition pals - the DUP.Their 10 MPs - who have promised to support her - will secure the votes needed for most of them to pass.But some Tory rebels are threatening to go to the other side and vote against her on some of the changes - like the ones on a vote on our Brexit deal, and the customs union plans.These ones are likely to be much, much closer, and will cause real problems if they are lost.The Government has already put down a number of concessions to plead with the MPs to come back onside, but will it work? Who knows.At the end of last year 11 Tories voted against the PM and issued a damning defeat on her.Its likely the same group could cause trouble again.They include leading Remainers Nicky Morgan, Anna Soubry and Dominic Grieve, who all want the PM to compromise more.But leading rebel Ken Clarke yesterday admitted that the threat of rebellions was melting away because Tory MPs feared that inflicting government defeats this week would topple Mrs May after the turbulence of last week.Gosh, if only it were that easy.Some of these MPs are incredibly stubborn and think the changes to the Brexit Bill are more important than voting with their own leader and respecting the result of the referendum.Last night the PM issued a rallying cry to all Tory MPs to show the public they will deliver on Brexit ahead of the crunch votes today and tomorrow.She made a crucial address to a packaged meeting of all 316 Tory MPs in a last ditch bid to stave off a damaging rebellion over the Government’s Brexit plans.Yes, Brexit is still happening, no matter what happens at the end of these votes. Sorry, not sorry, Remainers!But they could totally change what Brexit looks like, and it could mean an utter betrayal of the result for millions of Leave-backers who wanted us to take back control.Staying inside a form of a customs union could mean having to accept thousands more people coming freely into Britain with no checks.Two years after the referendum, plenty of people are unhappy that ministers are STILL squabbling over the ins and outs of what our position is.After these crunch votes are done, some are warning shell face a leadership challenge and another top Tory will swoop in to take her place.If she loses them, a new Prime Minister could come sooner than you might think."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000282882701.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"united airlines flight diverted to shannon airport after note claiming bomb on board found in toilet","story":"United Airlines flight UA-971 was travelling from Rome to Chicago in the US at the time.

The most dangerous would be a mortal blow to the Government’s negotiating hand and could trigger a new election.Another one on Wednesday would be a giant step towards shackling ourselves forever inside an EU customs union, without any power over its decisions. That’s the worst possible Brexit, a catastrophe.Monday nights fudge between the two wings of the Tory party is still a risk — and merely postpones an inevitable showdown next month.In the end MPs must have faith in our great country, our extraordinary talent and our ability to thrive outside the EU. And, if they respect the democracy that has put them where they are, they must trust the decision we took.Todays “meaningful vote” amendment, if passed, would wreck the Government’s negotiating position in Brussels. That is already weak enough... Theresa May has made far too many compromises and is doing far too little to prepare Britain for a “no deal”. But this new move would be deadly.It would enable Parliament to reject any deal we strike with Brussels and force the Government to go back and keep negotiating. It would strip Mrs May of the power to walk away.The EU could offer us a derisory and punitive deal knowing Parliament had compelled the Government to accept it in the end. It would be like haggling with a used car salesman who knows you have to pay whatever he wants.The diehard Remainers running an orchestrated, multi-million pound campaign to keep Britain in the EU are relying on this vote to upend the process. It could trigger a second referendum or an election which Corbyn’s Marxist wrecking crew could win.Tory rebels must have nothing to do with it. It is their duty to give the Government the strongest possible hand in negotiating our exit and a future trade deal.Another vote on Wednesday seeks to push us into a restrictive customs union with the EU. That would place us permanently and powerlessly under Brussels’ control — with no say over it, nor any ability to sign our own deals around the world.Free trade with America, China, India, Australia, Canada and New Zealand? Forget it.Remain-backing MPs pretend this — and staying in the single market — represent “soft Brexit”, a compromise to reflect that 48 per cent voted Remain. But they are fatal to Brexit and they know it.Either would be a far worse deal than we have had before. They are a ruse to engineer a new vote to stay in.We get that Europhile MPs hate Brexit. But they are there to represent their voters, not advance personal agendas.For some Tories and many Labour MPs the decision should be blindingly obvious: their own constituencies voted Leave. The manifestos on which they then stood for election last year promised to leave both the single market and customs union.Do they seriously believe it right to betray their voters and their own doorstep promises?Most people are too busy to follow the daily ins and outs as the Brexit debate grinds on. Outside the London political bubble, they imagine it’s done and dusted. They just want to get on with leaving. And in full.It has barely occurred to them that many politicians never accepted the result, have waged war on it relentlessly and are closer than ever to victory.Imagine the explosion of anger if that happens. If, today or next month, Tory Remainers vote with Labour’s opportunists to defy the biggest democratic mandate in British history. If MPs, having approved the EU Withdrawal Bill once already, back wrecking amendments drafted by unelected peers bent on destroying Brexit.That rage won’t even be limited to Leavers. Many Remainers also consider it vital to fulfil the result of the vote in full. They know staying in the single market or customs union is not leaving. It is a suicidal, half-baked Brexit.Why would anyone trust our democracy again if we took such a course, in defiance of the referendum result?The Sun understands the Tory rebels’ fears for the economy and jobs post-Brexit. We believe we may well be in for a rocky ride short-term, before the longer-term benefits pan out.But everyone should read the authoritative view from ex-Aussie Prime Minister Tony Abbott — who initially backed Remain but is brimming with confidence over what he considers a golden opportunity for this country, even if we never strike any deal with Brussels.The Sun understands, too, the worries many Remainers have that Britain could become less ­liberal, less open and more prejudiced against foreign migrants after Brexit. We whole-heartedly believe that’s unfounded.Brits are becoming MORE welcoming, secure now in the knowledge we are at last about to get the same control over numbers every non-EU country enjoys.On these two ​vital days for Brexit — and further votes next month — The Sun says this to backbench Tories: Have faith in the people of Britain.They made the right decision on Brexit and they will make it work... if you allow your Government to give them the chance.THE most Eurosceptic people in Britain are calling on Theresa May to make good on her promise that Brexit means Brexit.The Lincolnshire town’s Tory MP Matt Warman was a Remainer but now advocates a “clean break” from Europe in agreement with 74.9 per cent of his constituents.Office worker Beverly Iles, 67, said: “We should have come straight out. We shouldn’t be still messing about with all this.”Retired council worker Brian Isam, 75, said: “We don’t need soft Brexit. We didn’t pay Europe a penny when we went in and we should not pay them a penny to get out.”THE people of Hull want Theresa May to wave goodbye to the Eurocrats now.In the East Yorkshire city, the leave vote was 68 per cent, although Labour MP Karl Turner was a Remainer.Happy Cakes manager Debbie Scaife, 56, said uncertainty had driven up the price of ingredients.She added: “Mrs May, I call on you to do this for us now.“The British public voted to leave. They didn’t want five years of hell.”Retailer Vicky Paddey, 37, said: “I voted for Brexit and I’m proud to say that — it was what people wanted then and they still want it now. If we end up with a soft Brexit, a lot of these shops in this city centre will not survive it.”IN the North East, some impatient voters are calling for dithering Mrs May to go.Voters in Gateshead went 56.8 per cent in favour of leaving in 2016, against the wishes of Labour MP Ian Mearns.Florist Dawn Athey, 41, said: “I think Theresa May should resign.“She’s not the person I thought she was going to be.“I think she’s scared of being the Prime Minister who’s going to take us out of the EU.”And Jude Ditchburn, 51, from Gateshead, said: “I think she is betraying the country and not doing what people want.FORMER Tory Cabinet minister Nicky Morgan is a leading Remoaner — but in her Leicestershire constituency people want to get on with Brexit.The area voted 50.1 per cent in favour of leaving the EU.Brexit backer Andrew Cooper, 56, said: “They are dragging their feet, the people have voted for this and they need to do what the people asked them to do.”Cedric Hewitt, 90, said: “I think Theresa May ought to get her finger out and get on with it. It’s what the British people wanted.”And David Greasley, 85, a former quality control engineer, said: “I voted out and simply want out.”HARD Brexit opponent and Conservative MP Anna Soubry wants Britain to be shackled with a customs union.Now, they want her party to carry out their wishes.Ray James, 82, and Elsie James, 80, said: “We think the Government are failing to get things sorted. It is taking a long, long time and no people thought it would take this long.”John Wilson, 68, said the Government was clueless on disentangling from the single market. “It has become a shambles,” he added.TOTNES MP Sarah Wollaston switched sides during the referendum campaign and became a Remainer.But she is out of step with her Devon constituency, where 53.9 per cent voted in favour of leaving the EU.Christine Williams, 64, said she was disappointed with Dr Wollaston.“I don’t know if I can now vote for her in the next election,” she added.Butcher Chris McCabe, 70, blamed Theresa May for the slow progress.He said: “This is like the Champions League final and we are at half-time.“She still has a chance but she needs to get her team in order so they can go back out and win this.”WHILE the capital was the heartland of Remain, in Bromley, South London, there was a paper-thin majority of 50.6 per cent in favour of staying in the EU. Tory MP Bob Neill is a Remainer.Gardener David Alden, 52, said: “It’s been dragged out for a reason. They know how to grind people down and tire them out. The elites want one thing and try any way to get it. They want to stop Brexit.”Retired software developer Steve Johnson, 58, said: “They are trying to come up with these fudges — ways to try to renege on the will of the people without outwardly doing so.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Endangered not only by parliamentarians who never really accepted the referendum result, but by the Government’s negotiating approach, which risks delivering an exit from the EU which fails to deliver the control Britons voted for.When, on June 23, 2016, 17.4million people went to the polls to vote for Britain to chart a new course for itself outside of the European Union, they would never have imagined that, almost two years on, Parliament would still be debating whether to keep this country as — essentially — a non-voting member of the EU.Or that their government would still not have set out a detailed blueprint for this country’s relationship with the EU once we have left. So what has gone wrong and who is to blame?There are TWO BASIC RULES of negotiation. Know what you want and do not go into a negotiation unless you are prepared to walk away.Theresa May’s government has FAILED BOTH OF THESE TESTS.Even now, the Government can not say what it wants Britain’s customs arrangements with the EU to be after Brexit. Instead, we’ll have to wait for two working groups to report back before the Cabinet makes up its mind.This failure to know what it is trying to achieve has hobbled Britain in these negotiations — and handed the initiative to the hardliners in the European Commission. Mrs May must take the blame for this.She should never have triggered Article 50, the two-year process for leaving the EU, until she had a clear and precise idea of what she wanted the exit deal to look like.It has also meant that, in the absence of clear UK aims, those conducting the negotiations have treated the whole thing as a damage-limitation exercise.As the Brexit Secretary David Davis, who has been sidelined in the talks in favour of the civil servant Olly Robbins, complains in private, the civil service is not suited to negotiating.It struggles to deal with European chief negotiator Michel Barnier’s take-it-or-leave-it tactics.But the biggest mistake has been the failure to rigorously prepare for no deal. Mrs May used to emphasise that “no deal is better than a bad deal”.But she has never followed through on that rhetoric. There has been no big national effort to get this country as ready as it could be to walk away from the talks.There is plenty of blame to go round for this. The Treasury — aided by the Chancellor Philip Hammond — has refused to make planning for no deal a priority.Why? Because it feared if there was a plan for no deal, the Brexiteers would end up using it. Better, it thought, to make minimal preparations for it to ensure the UK stayed at the negotiating table.But this got it ALL WRONG. The best way to avoid no deal was to plan for it. For WEAKNESS IS PROVOCATIVE. The EU looks at how unready Britain is to walk away and turns the screw.Would Michel Barnier’s team feel free to be so dismissive about Britain’s proposals if they thought we might simply walk out of the talks, taking our £39billion divorce payment with us?It is worth remembering that a report from the House of Lords, hardly a hotbed of Brexiteer sentiment, concluded that Britain was under no legal obligation to pay ANYTHING AT ALL to the EU on leaving.The Government risks being left with the most unpalatable of choices: No deal or stay in a customs union with the EU and the European Economic Area, leaving Britain as, effectively, a non-voting member of the EU.Senior EU figures think they can do this because they do not see any serious attempt by the UK to properly prepare for no deal.If this country had made preparations for going it alone that were so big they were visible from the other side of the Channel, the EU would be engaging in the negotiations in a far more constructive manner and Britain would be on course to secure a much better deal.Leave-supporting Cabinet ministers can not escape their share of the blame for this, either.They should have been far more assertive and pushed for serious no deal planning.They should have insisted that Cabinet was updated every fortnight on Britain’s preparedness to walk away without a deal.They should have demanded that the Government had serious and credible contingency plans to deal with disruption to cross-Channel trade. They should have told Mrs May they would resign if Hammond would not provide the funds necessary to make no deal planning a reality.But there is, as the minutes of the Brexit Inner Cabinet’s most recent meeting make clear, another reason why “EU ministers had no fear of no deal”.They “observed the UK Parliament and prominent Remainers, who had formed a cross-party alliance against Brexit, and thought there was no chance of no deal”.Too many MPs voted for a referendum on our EU membership, then were not prepared to genuinely accept the result when they lost. Too many Tories were prepared to stand at last year’s General Election on a manifesto of leaving the single market and the customs union that they were not actually committed to. That is not being straight with the voters.One of the other reasons EU ministers are not worried about no deal is Mrs May’s loss of the Tory majority in that snap election.Ever since Britain voted for Brexit, the EU has feared the emergence of an alternative economic model on its doorstep.It worried Britain might become a hyper-competitive, low-tax economy 26 miles off its coastline.They expected that Britain would respond to no deal by slashing taxes and regulation to make up for the failure to strike a trade deal with the EU. This gave the EU an incentive to come to an agreement with us.But when the Tory majority disappeared, so did this fear. It is clear this hung parliament does not have the stomach for such a course.Indeed, Mr Hammond said in Germany in January that we would change our “economic model” if we could not get a good trade deal, then took that threat off the table in a visit to France the month after the election. He, unhelpfully, told the French press we would keep up the European economic model even after Brexit.The next big British mistake has been its handling of the Irish border issue. The history of Northern Ireland meant this subject needed to be treated with care. A return to every vehicle being stopped would clearly have been a recipe for trouble.But Britain should never have agreed in December that no new physical infrastructure at the border meant there could not even be number plate recognition cameras.The decision to rule these out has made it far harder to use technology to try to solve the border issues and has been grist to the mill of those who want to use Northern Ireland as a device to keep the whole of the UK in a customs union and “high alignment” with the EU and unable to strike comprehensive free-trade deals with other countries.The Government now finds itself urging the EU to accept a UK-wide “backstop” in an attempt to try to get beyond the Irish border issue knowing that the EU will break off trade talks before they have really begun if there is not progress on this.This backstop, though, is not a good deal for the UK. It would see Britain stuck in a customs union with the EU and following all of Brussels’ rules on goods, yet with no say in making them. It would provide a trade solution for goods, where the EU sells £135billion more to us than we do to them, but not for services, where we sell £92billion more to them.In these circumstances, would the EU really be rushing to complete a trade deal with us? Of course not. It would be in their interest to drag things out, knowing that the backstop would remain in place.If the House of Commons votes for the House of Lords amendment to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU or to take no deal off the table, it will weaken Britain’s negotiating position still further.It will make it almost inevitable that the only deal Brussels is prepared to offer Britain would leave this country as, essentially, a non-voting member of the EU.The Government has made many mistakes in its handling of these negotiations. But this is no excuse for Parliament to compound these errors.MPs should reject these amendments today and the House of Lords should respect the will of the elected House of Commons when the bill returns to it.Then, the Government should get its act together.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A Brexit that leaves it half in, half out and subject to EU rules it has no say over would be a disaster but that’s what seeking a deal at any price will lead to.As one of Britain’s many friends abroad, please accept my assurance that you don’t need a customs union to prosper.Without being in a customs union with Europe, and without any free trade deal with it, Australia does nearly $100billion a year in trade with Europe.In the two years of my prime minister-ship, Australia finalised free trade deals with our three biggest export markets: China, Japan and South Korea.So my advice to Britain is: Stop fretting! It IS possible to trade successfully under the WTO rules which already govern 55 per cent of Britain’s exports and it IS possible to do good deals with your main trading partners once you are free to do so, as Australia’s experience abundantly demonstrates.Let’s say, out of spite, the EU refuses to offer Britain a satisfactory bargain.Britain already imports goods from Europe free of tariffs and quotas. Britain already recognises European standards and credentials. Just declare that you will continue to do so.Trade from Europe to Britain would be absolutely free. And even if the Europeans — in an attempt to hurt Britain that would actually damage them — apply the same tariffs to Britain as they do to the US, the fall in the Pound would make British exports at least as competitive in Europe as they are now.Britain should still be the best place from which to export to Europe or to service Europe — because it has the freest markets, a can-do culture and will no longer have EU officials trying to harmonise away its competitive advantage.No new Brussels directives will apply in the UK. British courts will no longer be subject to European ones. And Britain need no longer admit everyone with an EU passport.Importantly, Britain will be able to strike trade deals with anyone it chooses without waiting for 27 other countries to sign up too.The coming Britain-Australia Free Trade Agreement should mean a dramatic increase in trade opportunities between our two countries without disadvantaging anyone else.First, there should be no tariffs or quotas on any goods traded between our two countries — there should be no exceptions, no carve outs, nothing. And second, there should be full recognition of each country’s credentials and standards.Because Australia and Britain are like-minded countries with similar systems and comparable standards of living, there should be no need for tortuous negotiation and labyrinthine detail.After all, Brit and Australian workers enjoy similar protections in the workplace: So why should they need elaborate protections against each other?Britain and Australia have comparable attitudes to job qualifications and product and service standards, so why should British rules be insufficient for Australia and vice versa?And Britons and Australians already have more than 200 years’ experience of each other, so why not allow them more freely to travel and work in each other’s country?This could be a template for the trade deals Britain could swiftly do with New Zealand and Singapore.On a similar basis, Britain could seek to join NAFTA, (North American Free Trade Agreement) which could become the North Atlantic Free Trade Area — and perhaps open to other free market economies seeking to escape the regulatory restraints and statism of the EU.Brexit could begin a process leading to genuinely freer global trade, rather than protectionist trade blocs.Brexit is a wonderful opportunity for Britain and the wider world — if only British leaders are prepared to make the most of it.So go for it Britain, for all our sakes!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They say the country will become a bureaucratic basket case.That is baffling news for the port workers in Felixstowe.Their system is so efficient that some EU containers, arriving on non-EU ships go through the processing system anyway as it is so painless.Shipping journalist Dean Cable explains: “Some politicians say leaving the EU will be bad for us but it doesn’t have to be and Felixstowe proves that.“Goods come and go without fuss, whether they are from inside the EU or not.”No wonder Brexit naysayers never mention this place when they talk about Britain’s post-Brexit trading arrangements.They would prefer you to think that if we left the customs union, lorries at Dover and Folkestone will be stuck in queues 30 miles long.Our haulage industry will grind to a halt, they claim, and Britain will be gripped by food shortages.But anyone who visits the port of Felixstowe will quickly realise that is utter baloney.For a start, it deals with 25 times more trade than the entire Irish border — which handles £3billion a year — and does so without a hitch.Across the 8,360-acre site on Friday afternoon, things are busy, but calm — without a customs officer in sight.Down at the docks, the vast vessel Marie Maersk, newly arrived from Sri Lanka, was being unloaded by crane, with no complicated paperwork.Dean tells me that it is the 11th largest container ship in the world, capable of holding 18,270 containers. All have come from outside of the customs union but will be on the road within the hour.Felixstowe is proof that leaving the customs union will not be the logistical disaster that some warn it could be.Figures show an estimated 98 per cent of non-EU crates pass through the port of Felixstowe as quickly and easily as goods that arrive from within the EU.This is because the non-EU goods have cleared customs before they even reach Britain thanks to a digital cargo-tracking system called Destin8.Tax officials at HMRC monitor every single non-EU container ship using the system, working out the tariffs and duty owed. Intelligence gathering and data analysis helps identify 80,000 of the four million containers to be searched and monitored for any infringements.People who work in the freight industry are adamant that Felixstowe’s systems can be adapted for Ireland.They say no hard border would need to be built and trade can continue as before.And it will not cost billions of pounds nor take years because everything is digital.Jason Flower is managing director of KWL Logistics and chairman of the Felixstowe Port Users’ Association, an independent trade body which represents 115 warehouse keepers, shipping lines and hauliers — some with business interests in Northern Ireland.Although he voted Remain, he said: “Brexit will work. It’s got to work. The public voted out. Get on with it.”Asked whether there is any need for a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, he says: “Not with documentation nowadays. All they care about is the movement of the cargo and the duties and taxes involved. I don’t see the need for a hard border because everything is digital now.”In Felixstowe, adding EU trade to the Destin8 system could be achieved in a matter of minutes. Alan Long, chief executive of MCP, the company behind Destin8, says: “It would probably involve a few extra keystrokes.”No wonder people in the town of Felixstowe are baffled by Remainers’ obsession with the hard border.“My husband’s a crane driver at the docks. I’m sure talk of a hard border is nonsense.”Prominent Brexiteer and Labour MP Kate Hoey, who is from Northern Ireland, told The Sun: “All this talk of creating a border is ridiculous. There is already a border. The Irish Republic has a different currency, different corporation tax and excise duties. But it isn’t an infrastructure border.“The only people talking about creating a trade border are either Remain politicians trying to undermine Brexit or Sinn Fein politicians using Brexit as an excuse to try to split Northern Ireland from Great Britain.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An endless, choking diet of documentaries, live events, lectures, news items and outright bollockings, from the BBC, all to celebrate the 100th anniversary of women getting the vote.Not one of which had as much impact as Love Island’s “Girl Power” task on ITV2, involving super-hero capes, bikinis, large items of fruit and narrator Iain Stirling explaining: “The girls will squish melons with their bums. Slowest girl to crush her melon is out of the contest.”Just part of the reason I adore a show which pricks pomposity and political correctness like ­nothing else on British television and is dedicated to no other purpose than entertaining its viewers. That’s the ideal, anyway.The reality’s been a bit more disappointing, so far, probably due to the excessive hype and sense of deja vu with contestants on either half of the gender divide.Both operate a squad rotation system, of course, but among the main players on the blokes’ side, we have painfully shy ­doctor Alex, with all the presence of a fire extinguisher, Jack who “got his teeth in Turkey”, possibly by ripping them from a feral mountain goat’s mouth, and this year’s comedy figure Niall, who’s “an investment for the future”, a bit like Betamax video tapes, and “multi-layered”, like a landfill site.There’s the compulsory personal trainer, as well, of course — Adam, who seems to have the run of the females, plus strong silent type Wes and fluffy-haired Eyal, pronounced “Eeeeh-al”, “Oooh-all”, or just “Aaaah-sole”, if you prefer.Quite the ­profound one, is Eyal, forever banging on about “auras” and his spirituality while insisting: “I want to find someone here with depth.”A claim which, surely, represents the very height of human optimism given the most profound question all of the girls were asking last week was: “Where’s your head at?”In Kendall’s case, it was “literally all over the place”. One of her eyes was in Majorca, another in Ibiza and her ­forehead was somewhere in the Cote d’Azur. She’s gone though now, leaving, among significant others: Samira, Georgia, Rosie, super- manipulative Hayley and Laura, a former air stewardess who’s ­covered in more make-up than the giraffe in a theatre ­production of The Lion King.Most of the hype, however, has centred around the ­presence of Dani Dyer, the daughter of EastEnders actor Danny Dyer. But you knew that already, didn’t you, possibly because you read it in the paper and possibly because you saw her perform exactly the same big reveal on ITV2’s Survival Of The Fittest a couple of months ago. A doubling up that blows my mind, frankly.Because you expect hit shows to be copied by other fringe channels.What you don’t expect is ITV2 to abuse the basic law of ­supply and demand by copying its own format. A move that doesn’t help Love Island at all. It stops it being an event, in fact, and just makes viewers think this sort of crap is on all year.Personally, I think that’s a shame. Love Island genuinely deserves to be a huge success again. Not only is it one of the funniest and most UN-PC shows on TV, it’s also a series that can actually make you feel glad to be old and half-crippled by your medical complaints, rather than the youthful insecurity and stupidity which has gripped this bunch, who really did surpass themselves, on Friday.Georgia: “What do you think of Brexit?”Hayley: “What’s that?”“We’re leaving the EU so things like welfare and, like, things we trade with would all be cut down.”“So that means we wouldn’t have any trees?”“Cheese?” “No, trees.” “Oh.”Emmeline Pankhurst, your work here on Earth was not in vain.(Love Island, ITV2, 9pm).HAVING discovered Danny Dyer is the rightful heir to the English throne, BBC1 really should’ve knocked it on the head with Who Do You Think You Are?Until such time as one of the researchers can prove Danniella Westbrook is the rightful heir to the Romanov dynasty and the Imperial Highness of all Russia.So they must have been flipping cartwheels at HQ when they discovered the great-great-grandmother of this week’s guest, ex-Corrie star Michelle Keegan had her birth certificate signed by registrar Emmeline Pankhurst, leader of the Suffragettes.A much greater honour, in the Beeb’s book, than three wise men and some shepherds turning up at your crib, but a detail that was probably as dull as ditch water for most viewers.The far more interesting thing to emerge during the hour, I thought, was Michelle’s own staggering ignorance of life, the world and everything.She had, for instance, no idea where Genoa was and gave a genuinely staggering response when a local historian told her: “By 1940 your family will have been torn apart, like every other family in Gibraltar, at the time.”“Why?”(Pause) “The Second World War.”You wondered then if the show would ever get round to revealing if the plank gene had entered her family tree through the maternal or paternal line.Then Michelle Skyped her mum and, waving a frothy cup of coffee at the screen, said: “Guess where I am. I’ll give you a clue, I’m drinking a cappuccino . . . ”“France?”Mystery solved.Loose Women, Russell Brand, with Janet Street-Porter: “Everyone is so beautiful here.”Good Morning Britain, roly-poly Piers Morgan: “When I grew up, I loved Frosties and it never did me any harm.”And Love Island, Samira: “I can sing, I can dance, I can act.” (Bursts into song).She can’t sing.NEVER, in all its ten-series history, has ITV’s love lift been quite as badly needed as it was on Saturday’s brilliant, one-off Take Me Out special for the “over-50s”.A slightly generous description, I thought, given the 30 game old birds looked like they had the combined age of the Pyramids.The fire still burns down below, though, evidently, as a queue of lights remained on for George, the midget Zumba teacher with the wooden teeth, Lawrence, the Billy Connolly lookalike from Ibiza, and even “bouncing Bill”, the ex-policeman, above, who emerged from Paddy McGuinness’s love lift gasping for breath and telling the women: “Every night, when I go to sleep, I like to think I’ve made someone’s life better. What would your motto be?”Fingers crossed, I’d imagine.Lee Dixon: “I like Alexander-Arnold because he gives you half a goal.”Ian Wright: “Harry Kane is still getting back to where he is.”And Glenn Hoddle: “By the time the World Cup starts, today will be history.”(Compiled by Graham Wray)Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In 1883 which luxury train service ran between Paris and the city now called Istanbul?” Alice: “The Eurostar.”Ben Shephard: “The former Labour MP Ed Balls married which politician in 1998?” Phil: “Theresa May.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “The plumage of what flightless bird was used as a medieval helmet decoration?” Geoff: “Eagle.”And Ben Shepherd: “How many of the eight planets in our solar system have the letter A in their name?”Harj: “I think the answer to that is one.

He also analyses Irish border ­protocol, the cost of customs clearance and how we can ­maximise Brexit opportunities.Under the proposed New Customs Partnership, the UK would collect tariffs on all imports into the EU regardless of whether they are then exported to EU27 ­countries or are meant for UK consumption.If goods are only for UK consumption, then importers may claim a rebate. This option was voted against in the Brexit Cabinet but seems to have a zombie-like resiliency so cannot be discounted entirely.It would mean the end of UK independent trade policy and be disastrous for prosperity.No, it’s not lippy. Max Fac is short for maximum facilitation, referring to the process of creating a border between the EU and the UK which is as frictionless as possible.This is achieved by waiving duties on goods and employing technology-based solutions to ensure smoother border crossing.The customs facilitation chapter will ensure both sides mutually recognise each other’s trusted trader programmes – something the EU does with many countries – and optimise the customs process.The Irish border problem has been a crunch point, with some claiming there would have to be border controls between Ireland and Northern Ireland.But it is not insurmountable.Some sort of customs checks on goods crossing the border would be needed, but not necessarily passport checks or everyone being stopped.The use of technology is very important — it is ­constantly improving, lowering customs barriers.Much has been made of the cost to businesses of completing customs declaration forms after Brexit.Estimates as high as £20billion have been doing the rounds but a more ­realistic figure is closer to £4billion or £5billion.The whole point of Brexit, from an economic perspective, is to offset these losses with the gains from an independent trade policy.Economic studies suggest an improvement of EU regulations to US levels would lead to a gain of 12.6 per cent of GDP (approximately £250bn for our economy).The actual costs of leaving the customs union and single market (tariffs, clearance costs and the costs of lack of regulatory recognition) need better context.With customs, the costs of clearance in terms of increased form-filling is dwarfed by the opportunities that better regulation at home, and reducing barriers abroad, can achieve. Of course we should minimise these costs — and “max fac” is designed to do just that.But we must also understand what the opportunities are for the country.

Led by Caroline Flint, the Brexit-backing MPs have sent a stinging letter to Jeremy Corbyn urging him not to bow to pressure from pro-EU colleagues.EEA membership gives countries such as Norway and Liechtenstein access to the single market, but they have to accept unlimited EU immigration and EU rules and regulations. Jeremy Corbyn wants his MPs to back separate Labour plans for a bespoke Brexit deal that would guarantee the UK full access to the single market.But leading Labour backbenchers including Chuka Umunna, Mary Creagh and Chris Leslie, are among the 70 expected to defy him.The tension on the Labour benches erupted on Sunday when Mr Leslie had a bitter TV dust-up with Brexit-backing Caroline Flint.After saying Ms Flint of sounding like arch Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees Mogg, she accused him of sounding “desperate”. Ms Flint - a former Labour Europe Minister - was one of a cluster of Labour MPs from Leave constituencies urging Jeremy Corbyn not to bow to pressure from Europhiles.In the letter, the MPs, including Gareth Snell, said backing EEA membership would force the UK to continue to accept unlimited EU migration. Another split emerged as the TSSA Union became the first Labour affiliated union to call for a referendum on the Brexit deal agreed with Brussels.One source told The Sun: “The party is split two to three ways.

We were told we couldnt have anyone sit in on the interview, which after consulting with my solicitor I should have been able to.He said they attended a meeting days later for an update and were talked down to and laughed at by a highly-paid inclusion and diversity manager.Joe said he was ordered to attend another interview in April.He added: I was accused of being threatening and abusive towards a member of staff at the meeting which is completely false.The next day I was contacted by the hearing manager and told I was being sacked/stood down over the telephone, that conversation lasted less than 60 seconds.All this has cost the institution thousands of pounds which is supposed to be used to save lives at sea.In a statement, a spokesman for the RNLI maintained a fair and robust investigation and appeal process had been carried out.He added: We have upheld our decision to stand down two crew members from Whitby RNLI.Volunteers are entitled to appeal against our decisions and each case is considered on an individual basis.

And it won\u0027t just make or break her premiership - it could have a huge difference to you, your family, and your everyday life. That\u0027s because in a string of votes, MPs will choose whether to carry on with the Prime Minister\u0027s current Brexit plan or make it much, much softer. Mrs May is pulling out all the stops to prevent a Tory Remainer revolt that would scupper her Brexit talks, and leave Britain closer to the EU. The drama will take place on Tuesday 12 June and Wednesday 13 June.  It\u0027s all centred around 15 amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill , which is Mrs May\u0027s flagship law enacting Brexit. If the amendments pass, they could keep us in the customs union and very nearly in the single market - forcing us to stick to EU rules. This is the opposite of what the Prime Minister wants.  These amendments aren\u0027t the end of the road - there are more votes on customs next month - but they\u0027re a huge step along the road. So we\u0027ve gone through all 15 to explain simply what they mean. Enjoy!  What were the 15 defeats to the EU Withdrawal Bill? Your Brexit votes bingo card MPs are holding a marathon two-day voting session on June 12-13 as Theresa May tries to overturn 15 defeats to her Brexit law. The amendments, passed by the House of Lords, would push Britain towards a softer Brexit if they are not blocked by the House of Commons. But it\u0027s going to be massively confusing. Who\u0027s voting on what, when? To help you follow the drama, here\u0027s a list of the original 15 Lords defeats to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill - and what they\u0027ll achieve if they pass. For geeks, each amendment\u0027s \u0027number\u0027 is in brackets. As if it wasn\u0027t confusing enough, each one gets \u0027renumbered\u0027 so we\u0027ve included both numbers - the old number, followed by the new number. Some of these will be defeated, some could pass. Four we\u0027ve marked with asterixes (*) - these are ones where the government has offered a compromise to get them through.  Customs Union: Would force Tory ministers to take steps towards staying in an EU Customs Union - by making a statement on how they\u0027d do it. This could stop Britain from striking trade deals around the world - but would prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland and keep free trade with the EU. (1, 1) Single market: Would force the Tory government to keep Britain in the European Economic Area (EEA) - which practically means keeping membership of the single market, and following nearly all its rules. This would likely continue free movement between Britain and the EU - almost as we see it today. (110A, 51) Meaningful vote*: Would give MPs a \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 in Autumn 2018 on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal. It could force her back to the negotiating table instead of crashing out with no deal. Backers insist they wouldn\u0027t use it to \u0027stop Brexit\u0027 - but that\u0027s exactly what Leavers fear will happen. (49, 19) Brexit Day: Would remove the legal date of Brexit - 29 March 2019 - to let ministers change the date at the last minute if they don\u0027t have a deal. Leavers also fear this could be a tool to delay Brexit indefinitely. (95, 37) Northern Ireland*: Would give added protection to the Northern Ireland border - forcing ministers to obey the Good Friday Agreement, and keep the province in an EU customs union if it stops a hard border. (88, 25) Henry VIII powers 1: Would block Tory ministers from changing EU laws on several issues - employment, equality, health and safety, environmental or consumer rights - without enhanced scrutiny by MPs. (11, 4) Henry VIII powers 2: Would block ministers having a wide-ranging power to decide when EU laws can be challenged after Brexit. (18, 52) Henry VIII powers 3: Limits ministers\u0027 power to change law without a vote - they\u0027d only be able to do it if necessary, instead of if appropriate. (31, 10) Henry VIII powers 4: Would give a \u0027sifting committee\u0027 of MPs the power to insist Parliament gets a vote on legal changes. (70, 110) Refugees\u0027 rights*: Would continue refugees\u0027 rights to be reunited with their families in the UK under the EU\u0027s Dublin Regulation. (59, 24) Citizens\u0027 EU legal rights*: People could continue suing the government in UK courts for breaching general principles of EU law. (19, 53) Charter of Fundamental Rights: Would ensure the vast majority of the EU\u0027s Charter stays in UK law. (15, 5) Theresa May\u0027s mandate: Would force the PM to get MPs\u0027 approval for her \u0027mandate\u0027 for Britain\u0027s future relationship with the EU. (51, 20) Future EU laws: Would let ministers copy and paste new EU laws into UK law after Brexit, and carry on taking part in EU agencies. (93, 32) Protecting the environment: Would block ministers from using Brexit to water down any protections for the environment.

There are lots of pictures of adorable Prince George and Princess Charlotte running around, rolling in the grass and playing just like normal kids. Royal fans particularly loved one photo of Kate, dressed in a blue \u0026pound39 Zara dress, running across the pitch.

Helen Wright was diagnosed in July 2017 after a year of increased shaking and weakness which left her struggling to change nappies or undo her bra strap. The 34-year-old fell pregnant in February 2016 and started to experience symptoms of the debilitating illness three months later - but excused them as normal. After Helen gave birth to George, now 18 months, her symptoms worsened and husband Chris, 34, urged her to go to the doctor. The primary school teacher admits after receiving the shock diagnosis she worried about how she would look after her boys - and feared she would not get to see them grow up.  Helen, from Penkridge, Staffordshire, said: I found out I had Parkinson\u0027s in a phone call when I was looking after the boys at home. I had no idea what to say to the neurologist. I was completely speechless. The thought that ran through my head was, \u0027Oh my god, I\u0027m going to die.\u0027 My visions of Parkinson\u0027s were of old men shaking and struggling to move. My husband was in an important meeting but came straight home when I called him. I was in floods of tears. For a whole week I didn\u0027t stop crying. I kept thinking about what might happen to me and how well I would be able to look after the boys. I had no idea Parkinson\u0027s was something you could get when you were young and it was horrible to think I\u0027d have to live with the condition.  Helen began to develop a tremor in her left hand while three months pregnant with her second son George. The expectant mum put the symptom down to exhaustion from being pregnant while caring for her eldest son, three-year-old Oliver. But her condition only worsened after George\u0027s birth. After a visit to her GP in December 2016, Helen was referred to a neurologist and after eight months was given the diagnosis. Helen said: It was shortly after I fell pregnant with George I started to get a tremor in my left hand. I was also exhausted, but then I was looking after a one-year-old toddler and teaching primary school at the same time so I didn\u0027t think much of it. But after I gave birth to George the tremor didn\u0027t go away as expected. My husband noticed it was getting worse and happening more often so I went to go and get it checked out. In January 2017 I was referred to a neurologist at Stafford County Hospital and was referred on to Royal Stoke Hospital for DAT and MRI scans. It was a huge shock when the diagnosis came through.  Despite receiving the diagnosis at a young age while bringing up two young sons, Helen is determined not to let the condition affect her. The mum-of-two is still teaching at a primary school two days a week as she did before her pregnancy and is only taking a very low dose of medication. Helen said: Fortunately early onset Parkinson\u0027s can be quite slow to develop so I know I have plenty of time. My Parkinson\u0027s nurse is fantastic and she has done so much to help me understand the condition and that it is something you can live with. Sometimes my husband and I completely forget I have it and the children don\u0027t know. I can be holding a glass of wine and the rings will rattle against it when my hand shakes and Chris can tell me to stop making the noise. It\u0027s only then that I\u0027ll have to remind him I can\u0027t. Obviously when the boys grow older they\u0027ll realise what I have and it might be harder for me to be a more active mum, but for now it\u0027s not holding me back at all. I\u0027m living life to the full and I have a wonderful family to help and support me.

Liz Bowie, 71, had ringing in her ears for three years and believes she developed the condition after attending a loud gym class. The grandmother from Stourbridge, West Midlands, said the \u0027loud whistles in her head\u0027 plagued her daily.  Liz told Birmingham Live : “I just lived until the time I could go to bed, take the sleeping tablet and escape the noise.   “I can only say I descended into a very dark place where I could not enjoy anything. “I couldn’t read, I couldn’t eat. I couldn’t get any quiet at all.” Liz’s life changed one day in July 2015, when she attended a gym class. Playing the music loud, the instructor was also using a microphone headset to shout over the music. Usually Liz would wear earplugs in classes, but had forgotten to bring them this time.  Liz said: “I felt my right eardrum vibrating as all this music and noise thumped into it, and it really began to hurt. “I put my earplugs in later, but the damage had already been done.” Over the next few days, Liz started to suffer noises in her ear. After a few months there was a constant loud whistling in her head.  She was referred to a consultant and diagnosed with tinnitus .  Liz was horrified to learn there was no cure and she would just have “to learn to live with it”. Liz said: “This was constant. It was 24 hours, day and night.  “Because I was having trouble sleeping, my GP had reluctantly given me sleeping tablets. I just lived until the time I could go to bed, take the sleeping tablet and escape the noise.” In September 2015, former secretary Liz decided to go on a Mediterranean cruise with her good friend Arthur. But she felt so desperately ill that the mum-of-two had to fly home after just 10 days. Liz said: “I was very unsure about whether to go as I was feeling utterly desperate. “Arthur told me that, being away on the cruise with nice food and rest, I would probably feel better.  “But after a few days I just wanted to go home because I couldn’t stand this loud noise all the time. “Everyone else was obviously enjoying their holiday while I felt like jumping overboard.” From there, Liz’s condition deteriorated and affected her physically. She began shaking, feeling anxious and unable to socialise. Feeling desperate, she began searching on the internet for fellow sufferers to talk to.

The royal cousins were seen adorably playing together at a polo match this afternoon, giggling as they relaxed on the grass at Beaufort Polo Club in Gloucstershire. The duo seem inseparable, never straying too far from each other.  But at one point, it all got too much for little George who had a tearful moment and needed to be consoled by his mum, Kate. He seemed to have a sad look on his face as his doting mum took him into a loving embrace, tenderly stroking his cheek with a concerned look on her face.    It comes just one day after the Trooping the Colour celebrations, where sassy Savannah, seven, hilariously put her hand over George\u0027s mouth to shush him during the National Anthem. They were undoubtedly delighted to be reunited at today\u0027s match and were joined by George\u0027s mum, Kate, sister, Princess Charlotte, and Savannah\u0027s mum, Autumn Phillips, and sister, Isla. Savannah is one of the Queen\u0027s great grandchildren, and her dad Peter Phillips is Princess Anne\u0027s son.  It was held as part of a series of charitable polo matches that Prince Harry and Prince William will play in this summer, to raise money for the Royal Marsden and Centrepoint. The little prince, who is shy and reserved, held a mini mallet as he played in the grass, mimicking his dad, William, who was taking part. He kicked off his shoes and even guided his big cousin, seemingly showing her how it\u0027s done.

The author, clearly with their knickers in a twist, blasted mum Claire Mountjoy and implied tourists would be upset by the sight of her family\u0027s laundry. They claimed to speak on behalf of local businesses and the East Devon neighbourhood, and suggested using a tumble dryer instead. But the townsfolk of Colyton have made it clear the mystery sender is nothing to do with them at all - and now they\u0027re rebelling in the most hilarious way - even creating pant bunting.  Claire, an Education Officer for Devon Wildlife Trust, is a firm believer that the spirit of the Monmouth Rebellion still runs strong in the veins of the residents. And now the Laundry Revolution is under way as homes and shops across the town now proudly sport lines of pants and socks in defiance. Claire\u0027s personal favourite is a bra at the very top of a flagpole. It shows the fabulous community spirit Colyton has, Claire said, speaking with Devon Live.  Colyton is know as the most rebellious town in Devon. That kind of streak is still in its people. It is quite strange that someone should be so upset about it.

Yesterday they received the dreaded anonymous letter \u0027meant in kindness\u0027 asking them not to dry their washing at the front of their house for fear of upsetting tourists.

Following the recent spell of sunshine, Brits will be swapping sun loungers for umbrellas as wet and windy lows from the Atlantic shake things up and drag wild weather towards the British Isles. Conditions will turn much cooler and fresher from today, with strong winds and risk of gales by Thursday - especially across the northern half of Britain. According to forecasts, there is also the chance that winds could become even stronger as they arrive from the ocean.  Dr Michael de Villiers, senior meteorologist of The Weather Channel, said it\u0027s likely to be a windy day across the country on Thursday. Northern and western areas will be worst-hit with slightly less turbulence in southern and central parts of the country. He added: Marked low pressure will pass nearby to the north of the British Isles bringing a spell of fresh to strong winds and the passing of a cold front. Sustained winds are forecast to reach up to 20-35 mph, and 35-40 mph along windward coasts in the north with stronger gusts. Outbreaks of rain over the south-east are expected to clear eastwards Thursday morning.    However, heavy and blustery showers accompanied by strong winds are likely to follow over Scotland and northern England. As the winds pick up there is a possible threat of gale force gusts blasting exposed coastal locations, especially in western Ireland and Scotland. It\u0027ll feel quite cool in the north with temperatures potentially dropping as low as 15C in parts of Scotland and struggling to reach any higher than 19C in other northern regions. Elsewhere, temperatures will tumble back down towards normal for the time of year further south, with some good spells of sunshine.

The third sighting of the year of the legendary monster has been accepted by the official Nessie register. Natalie Hodgson and her family, on holiday from Yorkshire, took a picture of what they believe to be the head of the creature in the water at 10.30pm on June 1. The \u0027creature\u0027 remained for a few minutes caught in the moonlight before disappearing. The sighting by the family who were staying at the Highland Lodges holiday park at the time follows a remarkable, feature film length video of the Loch Ness Monster shot by a Nessie watcher from Ireland on April 30. Hospital clerical worker Eoin O\u0027Faodhagain from Donegal took a ten minute video from the Loch Ness webcam. The creature moves from right to left and as it swam towards Urquhart Bay - a favourite haunt of Nessie - and is seen diving and surfacing with water splashes. DNA sampling is currently being used to discover previously unrecorded organisms in Loch Ness.  However Prof Neil Gemmell, a New Zealand scientist leading the project, said he did not believe in Nessie, but was confident of finding genetic codes for other creatures. Prof Gemmell of New Zealand\u0027s University of Otago said a biological explanation might be found to explain some of the stories about the Loch Ness Monster. A global team of scientists, known as the Super Natural History team, will use environmental DNA sampling of the waters to identify tiny DNA remnants left behind by life in the Highlands loch. They will then establish a detailed list of all life living in Loch Ness and make comparisons between it and several other lochs to find if it differs from other sites. As creatures move through the loch, they leave tiny fragments of DNA through their skin, scales, feathers, fur, faeces and urine. Prof Gemmell said: Large fish like catfish and sturgeons have been suggested as possible explanations for the monster myth and we can very much test that idea and others.  While the prospect of looking for evidence of the Loch Ness monster is the hook to this project, there is an extraordinary amount of new knowledge that we will gain from the work about organisms that inhabit Loch Ness - the UK\u0027s largest freshwater body. Gary Campbell, Keeper of the Official Register of Sightings at Loch Ness, said the recent sightings showed the enduring unexplained appeal of Nessie. He said the latest sighting was the first of the monster in the moonlight. I know of no other of Nessie in the moonlight. The photograph was taken by the 11-year-old girl in the family, said Mr Campbell. It is unexplained. Sightings of the Loch Ness Monster set new global records last year. Nessie\u0027s 11 accepted sightings in 2017 were the highest this century. The Loch Ness Monster has certainly coined it in for the Highlands.

The victims were enjoying a catamaran ride along the Volga River in Volgograd when their vessel struck a barge, killing most of the 16 revellers on-board who were celebrating the birthday of a local policeman. Five people were rescued from the unlicensed boat, which sunk moments after the collision. The tragedy occurred a mile away from where England is due to play Tunisia in the World Cup on Monday, with fans already starting to arrive in the city.

The vessel was not registered and had no licence to carry passengers, said local reports.  It collided with barge Kapital Vecherkin.  The captain and owner of the catamaran, Dmitry Khakhalev, a controversial former local politician once jailed for hooliganism and sexual violence, was among the dead. His female friend Anastasia Khakhaleva was also killed.  A source said: “The people were having a party. Everyone was drunk.” Rescue teams were quickly at the scene but could only save five of the passengers on the catamaran . One of the rescued was reported to be a 17-year-old girl. Divers pulled six bodies from the sunken boat, and four more were found early on Tuesday. The dead included local traffic policemen and members of their families. Revellers were celebrating the 43rd birthday of police officer, Vitaly Negrash. He was killed along with his wife Elena and daughter Inga Negrash, 17.

It is a big job as we have 5000 ewes lambing and this ewe I found was obviously in trouble, with only the head showing. I pulled the lamb and found the conjoined twin.

I’ve been experiencing a high volume of emails and calls regarding complaints about the services.“The public pay their council tax and expect the bins to get emptied.“You used to have the issues with tenements having multiple wheelie bins out on the street. At the moment it is turning into a city-wide issue.“People are doing the hokey cokey with their bins.”Resident Raymond Dunsmuir, 51, said this was the “worst disruption” he had seen to the waste collection service since moving back to the area in 1996.He said: “I contacted the council last Friday and they said the collection was running late.“We never had any issues like this before the changes – it’s just been a shambles.“The grass and other garden waste is going mulchy and creating a smell.“As far as I’m concerned the delays in collections are down to cutbacks in the staffing levels.“I feel sorry for the team members who are getting over-stretched with the work they are doing.”Another resident said he believed that although council tax is going up, the service is getting worse.He said: “The area is stinking at the moment because the waste hasn’t been uplifted.“The reason for this has to be as a result of cutbacks.“I honestly feel the council tax keeps going up and the service is going in the opposite direction.”A Dundee City Council spokesman said the local authority is dealing with an “exceptional” amount of green waste this year resulting from a wet spring followed by a sustained period of warm weather.He said: “There was a near-40% rise in green waste delivered to the Riverside composting site in May compared to the same period last year.“We are dealing with a situation where many homes in Dundee have multiple brown bins.“Additional resources are being deployed to catch up with collections.

ties to dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn adopted man whose mother went into labour while in prison has appealed for information in Tayside as he now believes he has family ties to Dundee.Mervyn Miller, 73, was put up for adoption after he was born three months premature while his unmarried mother was in HM Prison Edinburgh, having been locked up in 1944 for shoplifting.Mervyn said he has lived a “lucky” life but, upon retirement, decided to trace his family history. He has uncovered ties to Dundee and is appealing to anyone who may have known his mother, whose birth certificate he has not found.He believes his mum, Irene Miller or Millar, was born in Canada but grew up and worked in Dundee. Mervyn thinks his maternal grandmother travelled to Canada while pregnant, but returned to Scotland shortly afterwards.He has found a cousin, Freda, and an uncle, Raymond, who live in Dundee, but neither has been able to shed much light on the mystery. Freda’s mum also lived in Dundee and Mervyn suspects she and his mum would have hung about together.He said: “It would be a great satisfaction to know what happened to her. We just can’t find a birth certificate. In a jute mill or other factory, everyone knows everyone so there might be someone in Dundee who knew my mother.”Irene ended up in Liverpool working as a prostitute but that is where the trail goes cold.His father is even more of a mystery, but as Mervyn is mixed-race he believes a man from Pakistan, India or Sri Lanka came to Dundee for the jute industry.Born with spina bifida, Mervyn spent much of his childhood at a children’s centre in Edinburgh. Aged 18, he needed both feet amputated after a series of ulcers and fevers.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/Gjen_Chicken_Club1.JPG-846x564.jpg ","title":"dundee takeaway dishing up free meals to mark ramadan if punters say a special word","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee takeaway is marking the end of Ramadan by giving away 100 free meals to vulnerable people across the next four days.The Chicken Club in Lochee is offering 25 meals each day for those who need them between 10-10.30pm each evening.Those who wish to claim a free meal need simply walk into the restaurant and say the word “Ramadan” to staff.The offer runs until Thursday, and includes a “combo box” of chicken strips and hot wings, fries, a drink and a scoop of ice cream.Ibrar Ibrahim, owner of the restaurant, said Ramadan was a time of discipline that aimed to promote a greater sense of generosity among Muslims – and this inspired him to give away the free meals.“Because the end of Ramadan is coming up just now, what I would like to do is give food to those who need it,” he said.“And this is for anyone – it isn’t just for Muslims.“It’s a gift from myself to anyone, who can walk in and get the meal.“It’s for the city – for people who are homeless, or can’t afford to buy themselves food anybody and everybody can come in for the free meal.”It’s not the first time the Chicken Club has given away free meals to those in need – 200 Christmas dinners were provided to the vulnerable and needy during the festive season last year.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/03/58be8becc55c2-e1488888951866.jpg ","title":"ex dundee man etxabeguren one of two new defensive targets for dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United’s search for new centre-backs continues apace as former Dundee defender Julen Etxabeguren and ex-Tannadice man Callum Morris have been added to their list of targets.Both are free agents, though, the Tangerines face a battle to land either signature.Etxabeguren was released by the Dark Blues last month after an injury-hit year and has returned to Spain.Whether he can be enticed back to Scotland remains to be seen, although, he did enjoy his time in Dundee.Morris, meanwhile, told Dunfermline he was leaving them to return to England but a move back to former club United might be enough for him to shelve those plans.The 28-year-old played 45 times for Jackie McNamara at Tannadice over two seasons but, like Etxabeguren, has a history of injuries.He did play 40 games last season for the Pars, however.Also on the list is former Partick man Frederic Frans.The Belgian centre-back is wanted by his former club also, as well as fellow-Championship side Ross County.Meanwhile, United have announced their first pre-season friendly.Csaba Laszlo’s men will head to Brechin City on Tuesday, July 3, kick-off 7.45pm.That sees both city clubs heading to Glebe Park in pre-season because it’s the only grass pitch in the area, apart from Arbroath.n Former Dundee United favourite Nadir Ciftci is leaving Celtic at the end of this month.Motherwell are favourites to sign the man they had on loan last season.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"former dundee keeper malherbe secured move to greek super league","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee squad member Jeremy Malherbe has headed to Greece after signing for Panionios.The French goalkeeper was brought in to cover first-choice Elliott Parish at the start of January after the departure of Scott Bain.However, despite being at the Dark Blues for six months, Malherbe didn’t manage to make a single appearance as Development goalkeeper Calum Ferrie overtook him in the pecking order.The 27-year-old arrived in Dundee after leaving Dinamo Brest in Belarus and now heads for the Greek Super League.Panionios finished in seventh spot in Greece’s top flight last season, only five points off a Europa League place.Malherbe has signed a two-year deal.Meanwhile, the arrival of former Hearts goalie Jack Hamilton this summer may see Ferrie and fellow young keeper Kyle Gourlay head out on loan in the coming season to gain experience.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b15181238bc4-940x539.jpg ","title":"historic city vaults now gearing up for new businesses amid dundee waterfront development","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt was once home to some of the city’s finest retailers and a place of escape for scores of youngsters.Now the historic City Vaults is gearing up to welcome its first new business for decades in a marquee year for Dundee.Brassica will occupy one of the new units created on Shore Terrace, at the rear of the Caird Hall.But while the owners and council bosses are looking to the future, the venue’s past is not far from the memories of many Dundonians.A huge range of retailers occupied the arcade and market in the 1960s. This included a florist, butcher, confectioner, fishmonger, linoleum merchant, fancy goods merchant, printers and a number of booksellers.One of most famous and memorable inhabitants of the City Arcade was Champion the Wonder Horse – based on a character from a popular television series.Lord Provost Ian Borthwick has fond memories of the venue.And while he welcomed the new development, the long-serving councillor hoped the eatery would compliment its “high quality” surroundings.He said: “I would say it is a historically significant part of the city and that whole area in particular.“Any proposal which brings life back to the city, and is done in a tasteful and appropriate manner, is always welcome.“I would hope that this development lives up to its high-quality surroundings.“I am sure it can make a major contribution to developments we’re seeing in the city with the Waterfront and the V\u0026ampA.“I remember I used to go down to the arcade and everyone used the rocking horse and all the other things.“It was very popular at the time and there were certainly a lot of popular retailers that used to trade out of there.“A lot of people will remember what it was like – that area has always been such a major part of the city. I wouldn’t like to see it brought down in any way so hopefully this new development can be a good addition.”When built, both the ground and first floors of the Caird Hall were used for retail units.This was a stipulation put in place by Sir James Caird – the original funder of the project – who believed that retail spaces would be essential to offset the cost of running the hall.The building was gifted to the-then Dundee Burgh Council.The McManus now houses Champion the Wonder Horse, which took pride of place in the City Arcade – opened in the ground floor of the Caird Hall from the 1930s.The City Arcade closed in 1981, having gone into decline when the bus stance was removed to make way for the construction of Tayside House.It was then used as the main council housing office until the move to Dundee House.As well as Brassica, St Andrews Brewing Company will also be moving into the City Vaults with plans for a £1 million restaurant.The company signed a lease for two units in the basement earlier this year.Brassica aims to offer an informal dining experience similar to restaurants in Copenhagen and New York.It is expected that 30 people will be employed by the company as part of the new development.General manager Nikos Matsikas said: “Our staff are really looking forward to welcoming the first customers to Brassica.“Apart from sourcing as many ingredients as possible within 50 miles, Brassica will also be environmentally friendly, using no plastic.“I have worked around the world and Dundee is one of my favourite cities.“I look forward to introducing more people to it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1a516c449eb.jpg ","title":"jack hamilton signing a great bit of business says derek soutar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSigning 24-year-old Jack Hamilton is “a great piece of business” according to a man who knows a thing or two about keeping goal for Dundee.Derek ‘Soapy’ Soutar had two spells at Dens Park, totalling eight years, and has seen first-hand how good Hamilton can be.After Soutar suffered an injury in his time at Forfar back in 2012, a young keeper by the name of Hamilton came in on emergency loan to cover at the age of 18.Watching his progress since, Soutar was delighted to see him arrive at Dundee.Soutar said: “I was very surprised Hearts let him go.“He came in on loan at Forfar when he was just 18. He was a great size, very athletic and a really good shot-stopper, great at one-on-ones and his distribution was excellent, too.“With Jon McLaughlin leaving I thought it would be the ideal chance for Craig Levein to put Jack in for pre-season.“He’s moved on, though, and Dundee have a great signing.“I worked with Jack, he’s a great lad and really down to earth personality.“I think it’s a great bit of business by Neil McCann.“He’s a good age with plenty of experience as well at Hearts and all the different levels with Scotland.“It’s a massive signing for Dundee – he could be there for years to come.“He will have to bide his time, though, because Elliott Parish did really well at the end of last season after Scott Bain left.“Every goalie is going to have times when it’s not going for you but Elliott got through that and didn’t do a lot wrong. He’ll take some shifting for Jack.“What it will do is push Parish to be as good as he can because he knows Jack will be breathing down his neck.”After a steady first season at the now renamed Kilmac Stadium, Parish will feel he’s the current No 1 at the club but the arrival of another senior goalie can spur both to excel – and that’s good news for the Dark Blues.Hamilton has represented Scotland at every age level from U/15 to U/21 and was called up to a squad by Gordon Strachan in May 2016.He didn’t get a first senior cap but Soutar reckons he can push his way back into the national set-up by impressing for Dundee.He added: “Not so long ago he was in the Scotland squad.“He maybe lost a bit of confidence last season at Hearts and being on the bench.“He’s very professional and will push himself to the max to make sure he’s ready for pre-season at Dundee.“He’s very level-headed, he’s not one for the big-time if you know what I mean, he’s not a flashy kind of guy.“I know the kind of level Jack can play at, I’ve worked with him and I think he could get himself back in the Scotland set-up while at Dundee.“Whatever fee was paid, he’ll definitely justify it.“Further down the line, he could even get Dundee a fee if he moves on so, for that reason, I think it’s a great piece of business.“Working with (goalkeeping coach) Rab Geddes every week, too, can only bring the best out in Jack.“A three-year deal gives him security and playing for a manager who wants him in Neil McCann will help no end.”The former Dundee and Aberdeen goalie, meanwhile, is still going strong with his Derek Soutar Goalkeeping Academy.“It’s still going really well,” he added. “That’s us had 38 goalies over seven years go on to play pro-youth and we’ve had one recently go out to the US for a scholarship.”Any budding young goalies can find out more on the academy’s Facebook page.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1e51507a3be-564x564.jpg ","title":"james mcpake hopes to plunder us for new dundee fc talent","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee are planning to plunder the United States for top young talent to bolster their improving youth set-up.The Dundee Juniors of Central Texas has been a project running since American owner Tim Keyes and managing director John Nelms took control of the club.The set-up in Austin has been steadily growing and Dark Blues coach and former skipper James McPake is out there right now working with the youngsters.Speaking to the Tele, McPake admits he’ll be “outside his comfort zone” as he puts the kids through their paces in the strong Texan sun.He is tasked with heading a training camp over there as well as picking out some players good enough to come across and join his U/18 squad over in Dundee.He said: “Last year I spent some time over here with Tim Keyes and John Nelms just having a look at things.“The club have held camps over here every year, certainly since Tim and John have been at the club.“This time it’s a bit different because it’s an ID camp – I’ll be doing some training sessions and, hopefully, we can pick a couple to come across to Dundee and train with our U/18s.“I went last year just to have a look at what goes on but this time I’ll be coaching.“The facilities are great over there, too, it’s a great place to go to – though I’ll be needing to put on factor 500 with the heat!“We’ll be coaching in about 42 degrees instead of the minus two at Riverside with the wind in your face.”It might seem strange to some to see a whole squad of youngsters all training in Dundee kit in the middle of Texas but McPake is delighted to help “spread the name” of the club as much as possible.“The kids are all kitted out in Dundee gear and they love it,” he added.“Being part of a big club like Dundee is something they really enjoy and the club have done it really well. It’s great for them to have the affiliation but it’s also great for the club to be able to spread the name of Dundee.“You see Celtic and Man U shirts all over so it’s good to see some Dundee ones as well.”McPake accepts this week will be a challenge for him to test his skills as a young coach – particularly his communication skills.“You couldn’t say football, or soccer as they call it, is the biggest sport out here but it is really growing,” he said.“The MLS is getting bigger all the time and the national team has been quite successful, though they’re not at the World Cup this year.“The kids who are starting to choose football as their sport really take it seriously and they are desperate to learn.“I’m really looking forward to it. It is a challenge for me to get the kids to understand what I’m trying to tell them.“It’s the same language – though I struggle to speak English sometimes! – but there’s a lot of different words and sayings.“It will be a wee test for me to get my point across and then see how the players react. I’ll be out of my comfort zone and that’ll be a challenge.“Last year, we went and watched some of the age groups in training and I was really impressed with the standard of players.“As a coach, its great to work with kids like this because they are so keen to learn.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"local actor and director to bring acclaimed show to dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFife-born actor, director and musician Cora Bissett is bringing her latest production to Dundee.Bissett will direct a new production of Gagarin Way at Dundee Rep Theatre between October 16 and November 3.Set in Fife, Gagarin Way addresses the departure of socialist values from a region where political radicalism was once the cornerstone of the community.The play was written by Gregory Burke and first appeared in a theatre in 2001.It follows disillusioned computer factory workers Eddie and Gary who have a plan to make the ultimate political statement — kidnap a member of senior management and send a message to the world.Their plot starts to unravel when security guard Tom stumbles in on them.Worse still, the kidnapping hasn’t quite gone to plan.Gagarin Way is described as offering a stark insight into the harshest realities of Scottish society, tempered with fiery black humour.Among the venues to have hosted productions of the play are the National Theatre and the West End in London.Bissett is best known for her musical Glasgow Girls, which followed a group of activists that took up an ethical fight against the deportation of asylum seekers who had settled in Scotland.She is also recognised for writing the music for the stage version of Emma Donoghue’s book Room and in 2014 she became a part-time associate director at the National Theatre of Scotland.For tickets and more information about the play, visit dundeerep.Doors for some performances open at 2.30pm, while others are at 7.30pm.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b17b6e6b90a2.jpg ","title":"manchester united boss jose mourinho watches dundees former arsenal midfielder glen kamara amid transfer speculation","story":"\t\t\t\t\tJose Mourinho was watching as Dundee’s Glen Kamara picked up his fourth international cap in Finland’s friendly defeat in Romania.The 22-year-old has drawn plenty of interest in his time at the Dark Blues – Mourinho, however, was only there as a guest of Romanian agent Ioan Becali and stressed in an ad-hoc TV interview he wasn’t looking at players, just enjoying his time off.Kamara, meanwhile, despite only joining up with the Finnish national squad on Monday, played the majority of the second half in Ploiesti.The Finns, ranked 62nd in the world and not at this year’s World Cup, started the friendly match well but fell behind in the first half to Cristean Manea’s 37th-minute strike.In the second period, Kamara made his entrance after 57 minutes for Nottingham Forest’s Thomas Lam but almost immediately the team fell further behind.On 61 minutes, winger Ciprian Deac finished from close range to give the Romanians a home victory.Finland boss Markku Kanerva said: “The start was challenging but we looked good. We fought well and did not give up.“Of course, we should not be satisfied with this result but we did not have a full squad.“At the end, we got a little bit to attack more.“I had to think a little about the team when Pyry Soiri and Glen Kamara were only involved on Monday for the first time so they only played the second period.“There was little to be done in the last third.

I’m sure that full hotels, restaurants and attractions will be just some of the benefits derived from hosting the WUKF World Championships.“It shows what a changed city Dundee is and how our reputation and our ability to punch above our weight can deliver results, and provides an opportunity to promote our values and offerings on an international platform.”Kanzen Karate, based at Manhattan Works, put in the bid to host the WUKF World Championships in 2016.Roy O’Kane, Kanzen Karate president, said: “We’ve been working with partners across the city — Dundee City Council, Leisure and Culture, Dundee and Angus Convention Bureau — to make it a success and we can’t believe it’s here.“The response across the city has been immense. There is a lot of goodwill and support for the event.“Dundee Ice Arena is going to be rocking for four days, so much so we’ve had to add a 100-metre temporary marquee to the front.“Some of the federations who bid for these events have 60,000 members, whereas we’re 600. It’s been a massive mountain, but the guys have been totally awesome. We wouldn’t be here without the hard-working members and the goodwill across the city.“This is the premier event for the WUKF. It’s been held in Ireland, Poland and next year in Slovakia, but the fact that Dundee can be added to that list is pretty

redevelopment of Inverness Castle has been broadly welcomed.Already there have been suggestions for the site ranging from demolishing the entire block to creating a green space.But any action to redevelop the concrete carbuncles will not happen immediately as possible options have yet to be drawn up ahead of a public consultation, while tenants in some units still have several years left on the leases.They include the Scottish Children\u0027 Reporter Admin-istration (SCRA) which has stated its intentions to remain in its unit until the end of the lease in October 2025 while the Shapla Indian Restaurant is among the businesses yet to be contacted by the council on how the takeover and potential plans might impact on its future.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRestaurant owner Shabaro Ali said this week\u0027 announcement had come as a surprise, although he welcomed the news.\"Obviously, if Highland Council is going to redevelop the site, it is good for the city, it is good for us, it is good for everyone,\" he said.With about another 10 years remaining on the lease, Mr Ali wants the restaurant to remain in its prime riverside location where it has been for the last 22 years.\"I am sure Highland Council will try to keep everyone happy,\" he said.Orkney businesswoman Judith Glue opened her shop in Bridge Street 10 years ago and although she has yet to be directly approached by her new landlord, she was not unduly worried about the change in ownership,\"I hope it will be positive for businesses to be a part of a brand new project which would be good for Inverness,\" she said. \"Until they get in touch and tell us about the plans, there is not a lot I can say.\"The SCRA, meanwhile, occupies the main concrete block nearest the river which many would like to see removed.When contacted by the Inverness Courier last week ahead of the official announcement, a spokeswoman said there were no plans to move out.\"This is where our staff are based and where we hold children\u0027 hearings,\" she said.Following discussions with the council, that position remained unchanged this week.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspScotland\u0027 rural economy secretary Fergus

That will be the case here and it\u0027 important that there\u0027 a sense of ownership of citizens in the city.\"He said the aim of the group, which had met 14 times over the last three-and-a-half years, was to create an international-class attraction which drew people to Inverness rather than being something people simply saw when in the Highland capital.LDN Architects will look at the Bridge Street site to help create a masterplan by autumn prior to public consultation. A Highland Council spokeswoman said the local authority would become the landlord of any occupants or tenants.\"There will be no changes to the buildings until consultation has taken place, apart from any minor repairs which a landlord would be responsible for,\" she said.Tuesday 12 Jun 2018 1:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04111000/04111987.jpg","title":"British Empire Medal recipient honoured","story":"\u0026nbspAN Inverness man has been honoured to celebrate 50 years of volunteering with the RAF Association.John Maclean (83), who was born in Inverness but now lives in Peterhead and is chairman of the association\u0027 branch in the town, has been giving up his time to help others since the end of his active service in the 1960s.He also served in a number of senior roles in the organisation, and now his efforts have been recognised after he was awarded the British Empire Medal.Mr Maclean said: \"It\u0027 nice to have your hard work recognised.\"I took out life membership when I was leaving the air force in 1966 and soon after I started volunteering with the association.\"It becomes like a big family.

You have to follow the clues and work out what is going on.\"He has now written to her outlining the story and other details of her family history and is awaiting a reply.From researching the 1901 census, Mr Newton also discovered the dog\u0027 owner was a Gaelic speaker. He speculated the dog might only have responded to Gaelic commands, which would explain why it refused to leave its post when the fire broke out as the owner was not present.If no definitive answer is forthcoming from America, the public will be invited to help name the dog.The council has come up with a shortlist of potential names including Dileas, Gaelic for faithful.

I think that says it all.“He was such a competitor. That’s what always struck you about him.“The ceremony is a brilliant way to commemorate his life. It shows his family a lot of folk are thinking about him.”After the service, fans praised the touching tribute.Duncan Smith, 46, of Heathryfold, said: “It was brilliant. Absolutely superb, and quite emotional.“He was a proper Aberdeen loon.“The Gothenburg Greats were my heroes when I was a kid.”Valerie Donald, 53, of Hardgate, said: “It was just brilliant. It was really emotional, and it was very well organised as well.“There were lots of lovely stories about him, they put a lot of thought into it.”Graham Morrice, 56, from Woodside, said: “It was a great tribute to a great man. Aberdeen thought the world of him, and he thought the world of Aberdeen.”Two fans, Patricia and Ali Anderson, travelled from Elgin to be at the ceremony.Ali said: “It was brilliant.“There’s not many people who would get that.”Patricia, who knew him, added: “It was just exactly him. That’s exactly what he was like. He was a wonderful person.”Tributes, which included football shirts, scarves and banners, as well as numerous flowers, were lined up in the ground as well as flower displays carrying the messages“Stand Free” and “RIP” Tattie.Amid the sadness were plenty of smiles as fans heard tales from the former Dons star’s life, with many speakers greeted with cheers and prolonged applause.The event also included videos of Neale, and included his recent appearance at the Gothenburg Greats night on May 11, as well as excerpts from interviews and press calls over the years.Images spanned his entire career, including his famous goal against Rangers in the 1982 Scottish Cup final, and his time as manager for Ross County.A book of condolence was set up in the lower concourse of the Richard Donald Stand for anyone who wanted to leave their thoughts and well-wishes following the ceremony.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"homes without power in aberdeen","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMore than 1,200 Aberdeen homes have been left without electricity after a power cut.Engineers from the Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks are at the scene in Kincorth after the fault.It is currently affecting the AB15 area since being reported at 10.25am.A post on SSEN\u0026#8217s website said: \u0026#8220We apologise for the loss of supply.\u0026#8220We currently have a fault affecting the areas listed.\u0026#8220Our engineers are on site working to get the power back on as quickly as they can.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

She died because there was no match, but I signed up because of her.\u0026#8217Brett received his transplant in October 2015 and, after a long recovery, is now healthy and well.The identity of recipient and donor must be kept confidential for two years, to protect them both, but the pair exchanged cards, giving Brett and David the chance to learn a bit about each other.Then, on Sunday June 3, the long-awaited meeting took place in Campbeltown.Brett continued: \u0026#8216I had butterflies before we met. I was a little bit lost for words but I gave David a hug and shook hands and said thank you. We had a lovely evening together with our families and the kids played together, which was great.\u0026#8216Without David, my kids would have grown up without a father.\u0026#8216The first couple of minutes were a little bit overwhelming because there was so much anticipation,\u0026#8217 said David .\u0026#8216Our kids got along really well and I see us becoming friends rather than anyone feeling like they owe us something,\u0026#8217 he continued.David now works for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) and is involved in its partnership with Anthony Nolan, which has now recruited more than 10,000 potential donors.Amy Bartlett, regional development manager for Scotland said: \u0026#8216The SFRS and Anthony Nolan partnership has already resulted in 28 people donating stem cells but Brett and David are the first pair who have been able to meet, so it’s an exciting moment.\u0026#8216I would encourage anyone who is aged 16-30 and in good health to consider joining the register and visit anthonynolan.org/join.

After playing a neat one-two with Woody Hoad, Craig sent in a teasing cross for Keiran Caskie to glance past the Glasgow Red Star keeper.Lochgilphead introduced Jamie Stewart and Ciaran Gibson who helped freshen things up and work hard to close the game out.Special mention to subs Lee Harris, just returning from injury, and the ever reliable Calum Paterson.At the end of the game the Lochgilphead boys were presented with the League Cup and also the League Championship for 2004 age group teams to make it a double celebration.With three games still left to play the boys are looking to make it through the season with only one league defeat.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a dramatic way to aid learning at tarbert academy","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 09/06/18, 6:21 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert Academy primary pupils took part in a drama workshop based on the topics the children are studying.Rachael MacFarlane, a former pupil of Tarbert Academy, ran the one-day workshop, offering 45-minute sessions to five different year groups within the school.The history-based workshops which Rachael stages usually take place in London where she lives, but after being given the opportunity to offer the workshops to the Tarbert school she was pleased to help.Rachael said: \u0026#8216I loved bringing drama to the school in this way.

The ‘Highway Services’ would be located at Bogend Toll near Symington and could create 30 jobs. A Shell petrol station and Londis shop are part of the vision for the site. A raft of documents have been lodged with South Ayrshire Council as part of a planning application. London-based Grove Garages is behind the proposal, which would see two buildings erected.   The company has an agreement with Shell and Londis but is still in talks to sign-up a coffee firm.  The plan includes eight fuel pumps, 11 parking spaces, two car wash bays and pumps for HGVs.  The coffee shop would have a floor space of 260sqm with 29 car spaces and a drive through at the back. A supporting statement said: “The location of the site represents an ideal opportunity for a roadside servies area to cater for the frequent tourist, haulage and commuter traffic using the A77. It said the development would ensure the “reuse of a visually and environmentally poor site in a prominent location alongside one of Scotland’s main tourist routes, the A77.”  The site used to be a field belonging to Dyke Farm. Access to the site would be from the B730 adjoining the A77 north bound carriageway. Cars could enter from the southbound carriageway through the existing flyover. Chargers would also be available for electric cars. A design and access statement said: “The proposals give back purpose to an unused site, which has potential to provide an important service to the local area and indeed the wider area. The design proposals are considered to be respectful to the local environment and are in line with local policy and guidelines. No decision has been made on the application yet.

Following a long battle with neuroblastoma, the 17-year-old died peacefully surrounded by dad Chris, mum Connie, and sister Olivia. It was a fight that captured not just the hearts and minds of Ayrshire, but the world beyond. Vanessa, who displayed courage which belied her condition, would rarely be seen without a smile on her face. For almost a decade, her name became synonymous with the fight against the aggressive cancer. Almost \u0026pound1million was raised with the aim of sending Vanessa abroad for life-saving treatment. That dream was realised and in January 2013, the family received the news they longed for – that the cancer was in remission.  Vanessa would return to school and rejoin classmates as a hugely popular figure at Marr College. Life, as normal as it could ever be, was good again for this inspirational girl. But the cancer would return and spread to Vanessa’s brain, with her family receiving the crushing news that her condition was terminal. As ever, Vanessa fought bravely until the last before she passed away just days short of her 18th birthday. Now her family are vowing that her fight will live on in her legacy. Dad Chris told the Post: “We are devastated at our loss.  “Vanessa was a huge inspiration to Connie, Olivia and I and so many more. “She achieved lots during her short but fulfilled life, she did everything she wanted to do and lived life to the full. “She never complained about anything, even though her situation was dire and she knew it. “We are privileged to have had such an inspirational and beautiful daughter.”  Vanessa’s funeral will take place on Friday, June 22 at 11.30am at Dreghorn Crematorium and then on to Troon Town Hall for a Celebration of Life. Chris added: “We’d like to ask that people wear bright colours and for the gents not to wear black ties. “That is what Vanessa would have wanted.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United. The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision. It is a big, big signing which shows our intent and now we need the fans to respond with an upsurge in season ticket sales.

The pair lost touch over the years but were reunited six years ago.

After three years in the sport, he is number one in the world for his doubles category and number three in the world for singles. He competes in the mainstream tennis ranks and is in the top 10 for the South/West Scotland overall.

We tried all kinds of things but nothing seemed to help. “My wife went online and found children’s charity Bibic and we spoke to them. They were a godsend and they guided us and helped Dominic through a lot.    Since then we haven’t looked back and he has became a fantastic kid.  “You would never know he had this syndrome and that’s credit to the hard work done.” Dominic decided to give something back to the charities that have helped him over the years. He climbed Goat Fell with a group of friends and raised \u0026pound810 for Bibic and South Ayrshire Autistic Society. Anthony said: “We are very proud of him. “A lot of people now do fundraising for national charities but the local ones don’t get as much exposure or sponsors. We wanted to help Bibic as they were instrumental in helping the way Dominic is today and SAAS helped Dominic from a very young age.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon church help build new","story":"NewsTroon church to help build new school for hurricane victimsThe Troon church has raised £170,000 to help transform people’s lives in Haiti.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley14:28, 7 JUN 2018NewsPastor Richard Woods with Minister Rolex visiting Muirhead Primary (Image: Copyright unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Building a school for hurricane victims was once a dream for Seagate Church.

reinstate a full-time service in the town.\nIn February 2017, the Border  and Peeblesshire News reported that the concession within the Daymart Newsagents on the town\u0026rsquos High Street had closed.\nThis sparked a six-week consultation by the Post Office on proposals to operate a one-day mobile service in the town.\nThe consultation was met with a huge backlash from local politicians and residents, who set up a petition to restore full Post Office services in Innerleithen and the launch of an appeal for local businesses to come forward to take on a concession within their stores.\nJust weeks after the announcement, local businessman Andrew Caldwell, of Caldwell\u0026rsquos Ices, came up with a plan to open the service within his store.\nBut a row over the opening hours with Post Office bosses soon put a stop to the idea.\nWhile the town has been without a permanent service, a mobile service has operated for several hours each Friday in Innerleithen, forcing residents who urgently need to make postal deliveries to travel east to Walkerburn, or west to Peebles to do so.\nA spokesperson from the Post Office told us that, while plans are yet to be finalised, further details about the reopening, including information about the range of services that will be on offer to customers, will be released in due course.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Work to begin on

Immediately Jewson Campbeltown chipped in for a couple, leaving 13 up for grabs.CDJFA said a small part of this will help towards the running costs of the festival. The remainder will purchase new equipment.In June 2012, what started out as a return exchange with Lochgilphead resulted in CDJFA\u0026#8217s idea for an annual football festival. Soon teams from Oban, Islay and Tarbert attended, followed by central-belt squads.CDJFA caters for football in South Kintyre for children aged from three to 18.In February 2012, CDJFA joined Campbeltown Pupils AFC, Campbeltown Soccer Centre and educational football to form Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.It had the simple objective to bring all local football organisations under one umbrella for the first time.In August 2012, CDJFA elected a new committee which agreed to bring the soccer centre and school football under the auspices of CDJFA to avoid duplication of effort and to give children and youths as many opportunities to play football as possible.This also involved signing up to the SFA’s quality mark scheme, providing a coaching framework and a player pathway for children which leads to the  amateur football team Campbeltown Pupils AFC.In early 2013, with nearly 200 youngsters attending CDJFA sessions, it registered Campbeltown Pupils Youth FC with the SYFA and more exchanges home and away started.In August 2013, 2001s, U13s were accepted into the Dunbartonshire Football Development League (DFDL) – the first time a youth team in Campbeltown had played in a national league.In late 2013, CDJFA was awarded the SFA’s quality mark standard award in recognition of its efforts.In January 2015, CDJFA progressed to development status of the SFA’s quality mark scheme.In 2017, two 11-a-side teams were entered into the DFDL at 2005s and 2002s.Tomorrow parents and helpers will assemble at 9am on the Meadows to lay out the pitches.Kick-off for the 2006/07/08/09 seven-a-side age groups is 12.30pm with the 2010/11/12s and girls section at 1pm.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dinghy sailors delight at record may weather","story":"It particularly suited sailors at Campbeltown Sailing Club\u0026#8217s (CSC) reinstated Wednesday evening sessions organised by Kintyre Seasports Project\u0026#8217s Sid Gallagher.The action continues this Wednesday, from 7pm and all are welcome, especially total beginners, as all specialist equipment is provided.CSC\u0026#8217s Iain McGlashan said: \u0026#8216It is another good forecast for this Wednesday so some along if you can.\u0026#8216Wednesday evening sailing continues until  28 June.

It might make you laugh.Somewhere along the line, in the last five or six years, the world seems to have developed a serious crack in its funny bone.And I do mean serious, no crack intended.And there I go again, being flippant, trying to raise a smile in one or two readers, even if it might resemble a risus sardonicus. (It’s how people on Sardinia used to grin, that’s why.)It’s a congenital condition – like my idiocy, claims my wife– that ever since I was young I made outrageous statements and people would say to me: \u0026#8216You can’t be serious.\u0026#8217 \u0026#8216Not on a regular basis, no,\u0026#8217 was my usual reply.For the greater part of my 70-odd years, while laughter was still an acceptable knee-jerk reaction to almost anything, I prospered, in a vaguely penniless way, as a freelance writer of would-be humorous journalism.Nothing too fancy, no slipping on banana skins, but not rocket science either.  (Although the rotation of the Earth really makes my day.)In retrospect, I see now that my humour wasn’t serious enough. It had no underlying message.  It had no sociological content.  It was not of the variety that allowed people to feel wise, nod wisely, and say something wise, like: \u0026#8216Very wise…\u0026#8217The mistakes of the past – of my past – included trying to make people lose control and laugh aloud, rather than just being able to smirk knowingly at my cleverness, if I ever was.We live in a much more buttoned-up, uptight and insecure society than we used to (do you feel my sociological message approaching?) and it has affected the sort of things we feel we are permitted to laugh at, or not permitted to laugh at.Scorn and ridicule can no longer be directed at certain people with impunity – the dishonourable exception being bankers and politicians, of course, who are still fair game, and rightly so, even if out on bail and technically innocent because they haven’t been charged yet.But when did you last hear a blitz of jokes from a television comedian about a small, ethnic, obese, female bishop, even if she was his mother-in-law?Don’t worry, the news isn’t all bad, and I can report that sometimes outbreaks of laughter can occur in the most unusual places – Dundee, for example – and at the most unexpected times.Not long ago I saw a funeral procession led by a slow-marching, black-suited chaplain who was laughing his head off as he walked along in front of the hearse.As I watched in amazement, his happy demeanour began to affect his slow progress, which became a sprightly strut, and it seemed at any moment he might twirl his top hat in his hands, or even produce a rabbit from it.Only when I caught sight of the wireless device attached to his ear did I guess he was probably listening to dance music on a radio earbud. Death is no respecter of parsons.Let’s hope the worst extremes of political correctness will gradually fade away, as common sense brings a return to humorous nonsense, and seriousness wilts in the face of jocularity.A life without laughter?You must be joking.David Aitken,Dundee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"flags fly as putting green opens","story":"There are 18 holes on the seaside green next to the children\u0026#8217s play park and staff also have three play tents, mats for younger children and a small selection of safe toys.South Kintyre Development Trust (SKDT) which manages the attraction has putters to suit all heights and a scorecard is provided.At the end of May SKDT was awarded £75,000 from the Big Lottery Fund (BLF).A BLF press release stated: \u0026#8216This funding will enable the organisation to not only continue but develop their activities at Campbeltown village hall.\u0026#8217At the opening were South Kintyre Development Trust\u0026#8217s Shaun Brown,  putting green staff Tina Chestnut and Peter Lusher with Morag McMillan. 25_c23puttinggreen01Baby Julia Skibinska, 11 months, was happy to play by the putting green. 25_c23puttinggreen02Cate McMillan, 11 months, chewed on some plastic ice cream. 25_c23puttinggreen03\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter mok run thankyou","story":"The continued outstanding success of Mok Run race weekend is a reflection of the ever-increasing dedication and commitment its hard working committee, community volunteers, local businesses, enthusiastic runners and crowd supporter’s display year after year.On behalf of myself and the Mok Run committee I would like to say a massive thank you to those who contributed their free time and energy to make this happen for the 13th consecutive year.Each year we are given tremendous support from many individuals and organisations listed here and this is very much appreciated.Sincere thanks to: Campbeltown Co-op, Wee Toon Sports , McFadyens, Mach Dunes, Tunnocks, AM Transport, Argyll Bakeries, Seafield Hotel, Campbeltown Pottery, Kintyre Agricultural Society,  Jim Martin Supplies, Killegruer Caravan Site, Machrihanish Holiday Park, Glen Scotia, Spring Bank, Beinn An Tuirc, Live Argyll,  Stewart Balfour and Sutherland, Campbeltown Running Club, Jogscotland and Wee Toon Warriors.By supporting this event, you have made a concrete contribution to the greater community.I would also like to extend my grateful thanks to: all the MOK Run committee members who work tirelessly behind the scenes our race marshals \u0026#8211 without whom this event would not happen race sweepers  race day commentator Councillor John Armour Gavin Reid Johnny Durnan David McMillan Willie Ralston Barrs Clochkeil Councillor Donald Kelly Argyll and Bute Council amenities team Campbeltown Police Office Southend Scouts Campbeltown\u0026#8217s: Young Fire Fighters Coastguard Sea Cadets Police Scotland Youth Volunteers massage therapists Brass Band Kintyre Schools Pipe Band West Coast EMT Jamie G  South Kintyre Sports Council \u0026#8211 for making our legendary post race ceilidh such a success Dalintober primary pupils for their motivational posters to our photographers: John McFadyen Campbeltown Courier\u0026#8217s Mark Davey Kenny Craig and Greg and Norma Grogan for capturing the spirit of the weekend Fiona and Donna Robertson and all the Junior MOK Run volunteers and to many of our other volunteers who took the time to help on race day.Apologies if I have missed anyone.A special thank you once again goes to the residents of Limecraigs, for taking the time to decorate the street, provide well received ‘showers’ along with the local fire brigade ‘shower’ who came out in full force to cheer the runners on in the final leg of the 10K route.As one runner summed it up on our facebook page: \u0026#8216Fantastic day !\u0026#8216Thanking all the organisers, marshals, water-givers, water-hosers, sweety-givers, pipers, drummers, sandwich and pastry makers, and everyone else involved.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School.

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.  Heather Jarron added: \u0026ldquoMany elderly residents without cars in this village would benefit greatly from having a pharmacy.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.  A total of 31,604 kilos of food was given out last year by the county\u0026rsquos foodbank, with 50,292kgs donated.  Peter Dicker, foodbank manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to provide vital support when it matters most \u0026ndash we\u0026rsquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community with no money for food are able to access emergency support, and that has only been possible in the last year because of the incredible generosity shown by local people in donating food, time and funds.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.

As many as 1,600 homes \u0026ndash as well as business units, a supermarket, primary school and various green spaces \u0026ndash are planned for the former opencast mine site at Blindwells.  The first housebuilder is expected to be announced this summer, with work on housing getting under way potentially by the end of the year.  In the meantime, preparatory work has been carried out on the site, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie and Port Seton.  Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.  Iain Slater, development and estates director, said the new exit would be permanent, although it would initially be limited to construction traffic.  Other works are planned for the junction, which links the A1 with the A198.  Mr Slater said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the permission the road layout will be altered to allow for the additional cars generated from the Blindwells development.  \u0026ldquoThese works include widening of the A198 approaching the roundabout to increase capacity [as well as] the installation of a filter lane to allow cars leaving the A1 heading east to go round to Tranent without stopping at the roundabout. There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.  Construction work on the 1,600 homes could take 12-15 years, with early plans already drawn up for a second phase further to the east which could see another 1,600 homes, as well as leisure space and a cemetery."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7870497.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Tranent singer Caitlyn Vanbeck  39 s first single takes charts by storm","story":"              TRANENT singer Caitlyn Vanbeck\u0026rsquos first single flew up the charts when it was released on Monday.

The premises at Olive Bank Retail Park has a completely new layout and design, including the installation of new fascia and frontage, digital signage, LED lighting, improved in-store navigation and new checkouts that are quicker and easier to use.  The alcohol side of the business was discussed at a recent meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board in Haddington.  An increase in the display of alcohol of 8.8 square metres was proposed and given the green light by the committee\u0026rsquos councillors.  A detailed statement was provided to the committee which outlined the revamp both inside and outside the shop.  It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality. This will transcend all ranges and lines including alcohol.  \u0026ldquoWhilst alcohol is very much ancillary to the overall offer, there is a desire to incorporate premium wines and craft beers.

Plain clothes police officers joined colleagues in uniform and members of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos community warden team at John Muir Park and Lochend Woods.  John Muir Park has regularly been used by teenagers who are celebrating the end of their exams.  But in recent years there have been complaints regarding underage drinking, with about 200 people at the park\u0026rsquos Bullet Hill in 2016.  Police have patrolled the area after concerns at public meetings regarding underage drinking and the flouting of local bylaws involving drinking in a public place.  On Friday and Saturday, police and community wardens seized the alcohol from youngsters aged 14 to 21, with a variety of lager, cider and spirits, including 12 litres of vodka, taken.  Inspector Andrew Harborow said: \u0026ldquoEvery year around this time we are aware of youths congregating at Bullet Hill. Whilst this started out as an end-of-school celebration involving those mainly in S6, the ages of those taking part has clearly widened.  \u0026ldquoIn order to reduce the risk to those involved, we have taken action over the weekend and seized alcohol to prevent harm being caused and will be making follow-up enquiries with parents, carers and local shops as to where the alcohol came from.

Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.

Dean Conner, 33, of Links Avenue, has been handed an anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) following an application by East Lothian Council.  The court was presented with details of the alleged anti-social behaviour of Mr Conner, including shouting, swearing and fighting within a property at Links Avenue, and disposing of items and bags of rubbish outwith a domestic bin within the communal garden.  The terms of the ASBO prohibit Mr Conner from behaving in an anti-social manner including shouting and swearing at neighbours and other residents in and around Links Avenue.  He is also banned from having more than two visitors to his property at any one time except those who are there in the course of their employment.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans. He said: \u0026ldquoI wasn\u0026rsquot involved in the D-Day landings the people that were are the heroes."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7252400.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"  39 Important progress  39  at Knox Academy  say inspectors","story":"              A SECONDARY school which came under fire from Government inspectors last year has made \u0026ldquosome important progress.  Education Scotland visited Knox Academy in Haddington at the end of 2016 and told parents that the school needed to \u0026ldquorevisit its \u0026ldquovision and values.  The inspection report, which was released in March last year, highlighted a number of areas in which the school could improve. \u0026lsquoLeadership of change\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquolearning, teaching and assessment\u0026rsquo were ranked as \u0026lsquosatisfactory\u0026rsquo, while \u0026lsquoensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion\u0026rsquo was described as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo.  Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.

While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.

I was playing football with a few of my friends at the local pitches. The rage that hit me as we were knocked out of the tournament was like never before. I can remember being so angry that I kicked the bags next to the goals containing our stuff, smashing a friend\u0026rsquos phone screen in the process. The rest of the boys were laughing as I was going ballistic and this was all over a game of football \u0026ndash I regret it to this day but looking back it was just what I\u0026rsquod needed.  I knew at this point that there was something wrong with me. For the rest of evening, I said nothing apart from apologising to my friend about his screen and offering to pay for a new one. I had never wanted to cry so much in my life but I held it together as I didn\u0026rsquot want to totally embarrass myself in front of my friends.  As soon as I got home, I rushed upstairs, avoiding any conversation with my family. I knew exactly the person to ring, my gran. She was the best listener anyone could have hoped for \u0026ndash always looking to help anybody out. I poured my heart out, told her every issue I\u0026rsquod ever had in the run up to this point whether it be substance abuse, entire summers spent solely in my room or the fact that my confidence with girls was at an all-time low. I didn\u0026rsquot particularly want to do anything or go anywhere, even pulling out of a boys\u0026rsquo holiday with some of my best friends.  I was spending days at school, working at McDonald\u0026rsquos at the weekends and not enjoying a single minute of it. Rejection from Heriot-Watt University. Rejection from IKEA looking to upgrade my part-time job made me feel like a total loser.  I\u0026rsquod been made Head Boy at Penicuik High School but felt like a below average student and kept saying that I\u0026rsquod been appointed because \u0026ldquothe staff felt sorry for me.  As I sat there, blubbing away, my gran told me to see a doctor. It was her that took me to my first doctor\u0026rsquos appointment and then counselling session. We\u0026rsquod had my future counsellor, obviously I didn\u0026rsquot know at the time, from MYPAS (Midlothian Young People\u0026rsquos Advice Service) speak to the school and I had previously put my name down on the sly but the doctor arranged an appointment sooner for me knowing that I was in trouble.  The counselling was great. It\u0026rsquos an experience that I went into with the most pessimistic approach possible. I couldn\u0026rsquot have seen how talking to a complete stranger who didn\u0026rsquot know me, my family, friends or girlfriend was in any way going to benefit me given she couldn\u0026rsquot put names to faces and wouldn\u0026rsquot know them if she bumped into them in the street. My counsellor, Angela Robb, was excellent and didn\u0026rsquot care about them, this was about me and what I was going through. I saw her for 12 sessions, because when I\u0026rsquod got to the end of my initial 10, I felt as though I wasn\u0026rsquot necessarily \u0026lsquothere\u0026rsquo yet so she was able to provide me with more sessions.  Robb said: \u0026ldquoCounselling is unique to each client and whilst there are some common factors in every therapeutic relationship, I tailor how I work, taking my lead from each person. It\u0026rsquos key to successful counselling to be able to form safe and trusting therapeutic relationships. I feel that I do this and my client\u0026rsquos outcomes and feedback suggest this is true.  But it was not only me going through such a horrendous ordeal. Some of the statistics and facts are alarming. According to menshealth, 9% of men go through depression on a daily basis, more than 6 million men. On top of that, 3 million men are hit with a form of anxiety every day.  Why is this the case? I spoke to Jane Anderson, a mental health nurse at Queen Margaret Hospital in Dunfermline.  \u0026ldquoI have been a mental health nurse for eight years and have probably nursed hundreds of patients, some you\u0026rsquoll never see again and others I\u0026rsquove nursed several times. As difficult as it can be some days it is also very rewarding.  Anderson says: \u0026ldquoWe are a recovery focused ward and building a therapeutic relationship initially with patients can be challenging. However, when there is an understanding that our goals are the same \u0026ndash ie to get a better level of health and be discharged \u0026ndash working alongside a patient developing care plans to suit their individual needs and treating people with respect. I don\u0026rsquot expect thanks but even seeing someone smile when they have been so unwell is a fantastic feeling.  She said there was still an unwillingness among men to admit that they have a mental health issue. \u0026ldquoBy the time they are admitted either informally of formally [sectioned under the mental health act] there is some recognition from the person that they are unwell. In the community, however, stigma is still very prevalent. The perception that males are raised to be stoic, brave and strong further enforces this belief.  I asked her what factors could lead to compound mental health issues. \u0026ldquoLack of knowledge and understanding, embarrassment, feeling of failure, fear of letting others down and looking weak, Anderson said. \u0026ldquoThis can be a generational issue, older males are less likely to be open about their mental health, younger males are more open although don\u0026rsquot necessarily accept it.  Although there is more discussion of these issues in society than ever before, I began to wonder what more could be done to raise awareness. I asked Anderson if she felt that men could be reached by information during entertainment and sporting events.  She said: \u0026ldquoI suppose the \u0026lsquoproblem\u0026rsquo is that mental health isn\u0026rsquot a nice happy topic so would turn people off from watching. We live in a consumer society, happiness and laughter brings viewers and readers and makes money for the big television and media companies.  I\u0026rsquom a huge football fan and it amazes me when I see people literally living my dream who aren\u0026rsquot entirely satisfied and perhaps feel that they never will be. The cases in Scotland with David Cox of Cowdenbeath who was taunted by a rival fan, \u0026ldquoAway and hang yourself and do it right this time, and James Keatings (formerly of my beloved Heart of Midlothian) recently sharing his battles on Twitter despite playing for three of the country\u0026rsquos biggest clubs. Even a Barcelona academy graduate, Bojan Krkic, came out and said: \u0026ldquoI had anxiety attacks but no one wants to talk about that. Football\u0026rsquos not interested.  That speaks volumes to me about the prevalence of mental health problems. Krkic has graduated from one of the leading academies in world football, has played in several of Europe\u0026rsquos major leagues (Spain, Italy, England, Germany and the Netherlands) and has presumably amassed a healthy standard of living through an astronomical wage but still suffers.  It\u0027s not a new problem. Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, was said to have reportedly experienced severe depression and supposedly contemplated suicide, often weeping uncontrollably. A key figure in the scientific revolution, Sir Isaac Newton, was seemingly psychotic, and prone to dramatic mood swings with numerous authors suggesting he was bipolar or schizophrenic. Vincent Van Gogh, one of the most famous artists of all time, was another affected. His enthusiasm for art came along with his fast-paced painting followed by deep depression and an apparent bipolar disorder.  In more recent times, many in the entertainment industry have committed suicide due to mental health problems. Frightened Rabbit\u0027s singer Scott Hutchison and the actor Robin Williams are all examples of people who, seemingly with the world at their feet, who have taken their own lives. It should never have to be this way.  Some may see suicide as the brave way out but the most courageous act you can take if you are suffering is to do something about it yourself and surround yourself with a loving family, supportive friends and people that ultimately want to put you right.

New legislation being introduced to Holyrood would hand councils extra powers to prohibit parking on pavements and double parking.  Previous efforts to address the issue were held up by various complications, including whether the necessary powers were devolved to Scotland.  The Scottish Government\u0026rsquos wide-ranging Transport Bill also aims to give councils more flexibility in running bus services, through working with operators, local franchising or running services themselves.  It also allows for the creation of low emission zones \u0026ndash such as that proposed in Glasgow \u0026ndash which will be under civil rather than criminal enforcement.  Transport minister Humza Yousaf said the legislation would give local authorities a new model to revitalise bus services.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are also providing clearer options for authorities to pursue local franchising or provide services themselves in appropriate circumstances.  \"Beyond bus services, this Bill will allow for decriminalised enforcement of low emission zones, double parking and parking on pavements.  \"This will help transform our towns and cities into cleaner, more accessible and more pleasant spaces to travel and enjoy.  The new proposals would also strengthen the technology underpinning \u0026ldquosmart ticketing, which could eventually allow all journeys on Scotland\u0026rsquos bus, rail, ferry, subway and tram networks to be linked into one payment system.  But critics described the legislation as a \"missed opportunity\" \u0026ndash insisting many of the measures don\u0026rsquot go far enough.  Scottish Labour\u0027s Colin Smyth said the SNP\u0026rsquos plans would mean \"public ownership of bus routes can only happen in very restricted circumstances.  He said: \"This would leave local councils picking up the pieces, running the very few loss-making routes whilst transport tycoons line their pockets on the rest of the bus network.\"  Green MSP John Finnie said: \"While we are pleased the Bill includes provision for local authorities to provide their own bus routes in areas where communities have been left behind by private operators, it is disappointing that it does not allow for the re-regulation of buses so that local authorities can choose to bring all bus services under public ownership.  \"There\u0027s also not a single mention for trains. This was an opportunity for the government to pave the way for a public bid for the ScotRail franchise and disappointingly they haven\u0027t taken it.\"  Scottish Conservative Donald Cameron MSP said some of the proposals would \u0026ldquoexacerbate feelings that the Scottish Government has an anti-car agenda."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/610721.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Nae Guid Eneuch  Private schools shun Scots history for GCSEs","story":"              A recent BBC-comissioned YouGov survey shawed that aroon 61% o Scots got their sense o identity fae their kennin o the History o Scotland.

A major report on schools in the developed world said staff rotation in Japan and Korea helped spread innovative teaching techniques.  The OECD report also highlighted cash incentives as a way of attracting the best teachers to schools in deprived areas.  And there was a boost to the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos policy of giving more power to headteachers.  The Effective Teacher Policies report said letting schools hire staff - a key plank of Education Secretary John Swinney\u0026rsquos reforms - led to improvements in pupil performance.  The report said: \u0026ldquoCountries with strong centralised traditions of teacher management could consider creating a mobility requirement, such as exists in Japan and Korea.  \u0026ldquoToo limited mobility of teachers between schools ... can hinder the spread of new ideas and approaches.  \u0026ldquoBy introducing a requirement for teacher mobility every five to seven years might stimulate continuous professional growth while also ensuring that effective teachers are fairly distributed across schools.  The report said opponents of school autonomy often voiced concerns that greater independence would lead to an education system that exacerbated economic and social inequities.  But it added: \u0026ldquoIn fact, many countries have been able to combine extensive autonomy with strong incentives to ensure schools prioritise student learning.  \u0026ldquoIf school leaders have some freedom to adapt teachers\u0026rsquo responsibilities, working conditions and pay to reflect the difficulty of tasks, they are better able to attract the most talented teachers to the most challenging classrooms.  \u0026ldquoOn average increases in school responsibility for selecting teachers for hire were associated with improvements in student achievement.  However, the report warned against giving more power to headteachers over hiring of staff too quickly.  \u0026ldquoSchool leaders\u0026rsquo capacity to manage human resources cannot be created overnight, it said.  Eileen Prior, executive director of parent body Connect, said moving teachers between schools could be disruptive for staff and children.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquod prefer the priority to be making sure every school has the teachers it needs and that those teachers are of the highest calibre.  Seamus Searson, general secretary of the Scottish Secondary Teachers\u0026rsquo Association, said the union would be interested in discussing the idea.  He said: \u0026ldquoTeachers should be encouraged to work across different schools to gain experience and pass on knowledge.  \u0026ldquoHowever, those who move across schools would need to be paid for the additional responsibilities and experience.  A spokesman for the Educational Institute of Scotland teaching union highlighted another of the report\u0027s findings - that countries which paid the highest salaries had fewer difficulties recruiting.  He said: \"Improving salaries is essential in making teaching a more attractive and desirable career option for highly qualified students.  \"In Scotland, teacher salaries have been eroded over the past decade.\"  A Scottish Government spokesman said its education reforms were focused on giving schools and headteachers more power and money to raise standards.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are based on international evidence of how high-performing education systems work \u0026ndash delivering extra help for teachers in the classroom, more professional development and a stronger voice for parents and pupils."},{"url":null,"title":"Landmark surgery helps baby boy to reach his first birthday","story":"              Little Noah Connell\u0026rsquos parents were told several times that their baby boy was going to die.  With rare facial deformities which mean his life is at risk every day, the tot has undergone eight gruelling operations in his young life - including one surgery which was the first of its kind anywhere in the world.  Even swallowing his own saliva or a drop of rain could kill him, but against all odds the determined toddler has survived to celebrate his first birthday.  His parents, Jade Gordon, 19, and Kieran Connell, 17, said was a \u0026ldquomassive milestone for the whole family.  Miss Gordon, from Robroyston, Glasgow, said: \u0026ldquoWe were told on numerous occasions that Noah wasn\u0026rsquot going to make it.  \u0026ldquoFor anyone, their baby reaching one is a big deal, but it was a bit bigger for us because we have had so many hurdles to overcome.  \u0026ldquoHe had a birthday party with all our friends and family at a soft play area and then went to Blair Drummond Safari Park, who set up a special visit for us.  \u0026ldquoIt was really emotional, it\u0026rsquos amazing how much he has come on in the last year.  \u0026ldquoIt is a massive milestone for us and Noah. \u0026ldquo  Noah\u0026rsquos arrival into the world was a massive shock to his parents as Miss Gordon didn\u0026rsquot know she was pregnant.  She was suffering from bad stomach pains which turned out to be labour.  However, her surprise quickly gave way to worry as it became clear that something was wrong with the baby.  Doctors knew instantly that something was wrong with Noah, who was born \u0026ldquolooking like he had no jaw.  His condition, known as hemifacial microsomia, means the lower half of one side of the face is underdeveloped and does not grow normally.  He also has Pierre Robin syndrome \u0026ndash a congenital condition of facial abnormalities which causes problems in feeding and breathing.  He has a small neck, floppy airway and cleft palate and part of his spine is also missing.  The toddler\u0026rsquos condition is so severe that he cannot eat or drink because of the effect on his airway.  He is fed through a gastro tube and he can only have 620ml of a high-calorie solution every day to help him pile weight on and grow.  His mother explained that even being sick or swallowing a drop of rain could be enough to kill him.  She said: \u0026ldquoWhen he was born he looked like he had no jaw at all.  \u0026ldquoHe can\u0026rsquot eat or drink. Even one drop of rain could be fatal for him.  \u0026ldquoAnd we spend hours giving him a bath because it\u0026rsquos so dangerous.  \u0026ldquoLast weekend Noah was sick and choked He went purple and stopped breathing for between 10 and 30 seconds. We were blue-lighted to the hospital.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos scary but it\u0026rsquos just our normal - he is a happy wee boy.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot know how to feed a baby or make a bottle up. But dealing with tubes and wires are all normal to us because we don\u0026rsquot know any other way.  However, the family still has hope that Noah\u0026rsquos miracle surgery will allow him to eat and drink normally in the future.  The life-saving operation took place at Glasgow\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Children on March 8 and involved metal rods being inserted to his tiny face to help secure the bones and allow him to breathe.  The surgery, called mandibular jaw distraction, saw doctors break his jaw in two places, with the rods being put in place to straighten his face and push his tongue forward.  It was so rare that surgeons had to send to Germany and the US for parts and consulted with other experts to decide if the operation was even possible.  It is hoped that the \u0026ldquoscaffolding will eventually move his jaw forward and help to reduce his chances of choking.  For three weeks after the surgery Miss Gordon and Mr Connell had to learn how to turn the screws in the metalwork \u0026ndash a process that has to be done with exact precision.  Jade, who cares full time for Noah, said: \u0026ldquoSince his surgery, his jaw has moved forward 4cm which should loosen up his airways.  \u0026ldquoThe surgery has worked as well as it can do just now and the movement in Noah\u0026rsquos jaw is a big improvement.  She added that both she and Mr Connell were shocked to learn that he could be the first person in the world to have the revolutionary surgery, but had no choice but to place their trust in the medical staff.  \u0026ldquoWe asked the doctors if we could see pictures from other surgeries like the one Noah was going to have, she said. \u0026ldquoBut they said they couldn\u0026rsquot.  \u0026ldquoWe couldn\u0026rsquot believe it when they said Noah would be the first baby in the world to have the operation.  \u0026ldquoIt was daunting to hear that but we trusted them.

The latest report by the Charities Aid Foundation reveals that there has been a 50 per cent annual rise in donations to charity last year with the total given crashing through the \u0026pound1 billion barrier.  But the CAF said it was of \"some concern\" that there was a slight dip in the number of people giving money to charity year-on-year and that the rise is the result of the same number of people giving more, with the typical donation going up from \u0026pound36 in 2016 to \u0026pound60 in 2017.  It is believed the drop may be the result of a drop in trust in charities.  It comes as experts in the third sector earlier this year warned\u0026nbspin February that donations to Scottish charities could be damaged by the Oxfam sex scandal and public trust could be hit hard.  Oxfam workers in Haiti were accused of paying prostitutes and holding \u0026lsquoCaligula-style\u0026rsquo orgies, with participants allegedly including under-age girls, in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake there.  It was then\u0026nbspalso alleged that the charity knew about concerns over the behaviour of Oxfam\u0026rsquos country director for Haiti, Roland van Hauwermeiren, in a previous posting in Chad.    Figures released by the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations in February showed that trust in charities had dropped by nine per cent over the last two years.  The SCVO findings prompted the group to launch a new campaign called I Love Charity, amid evidence that donations were being hit.  The CAF\u0026rsquos Scotland Giving report says Scotsgave an estimated \u0026pound1.2 billion to charity in 2017, up from the\u0026nbsp\u0026pound813 million donated in 2016.  It also said that in 2017, 63 per cent of Scots questioned claimed to have donated money to charity compared to 65 per cent in 2016.  The CAF survey report said: \"This leads to a key policy question about how to encourage giving and whether it should focus on getting more people to give or getting those who give to give more, or indeed, a combination of both.\"  Anna Fowlie, chief executive of the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO) said: \u0026ldquoThe findings from CAF\u0026rsquos report are fairly positive as they show that although the number of people giving has decreased, the amount of money being donated to charities in Scotland has gone up, which is great.  \"Figures released by SCVO in February 2018 showed that while trust in charities in Scotland is still high, it has dropped by nine per cent over the last two years, which may help explain why the number of people giving is down.    \"However our survey also showed that trust in local charities remains strong, particularly where people had personal experience of a charity, so it may be that the increase in giving is down to the impact of the good work organisations do in communities.  The Institute of Fundraising said the dip in donors may be because charities are focusing on giving \"existing supporters an even better experience\" instead of concentrating on attracting new supporters.  Alex Close, head of Scotland at the Institute of Fundraising, said \"We\u0026rsquore pleased to hear that the generosity of the Scottish public continues and it\u0026rsquos great to see a rise in the donation amounts that people in Scotland say that they have given.  \"The increase is likely to be caused by a combination of factors, rather than one single reason, including people feeling more financially secure, or a great experience with a charity that inspires them to increase their regular donation.    \"Many charities have been focusing even more on giving existing supporters a great donor experience and inspiring them to increase their regular donations. We hope that this generous trend continues and the Scottish public continue to give to good causes. \"  CAF found that Scotland accounts for 11.8 per cent of all UK charitable donations, despite representing 8.4 per cent of the UK\u0026rsquos population.  It found that the most popular causes supported by those in Scotland were children and young people, with 28 per cent of those surveyed saying they had donated to this cause. This was followed by medical research (27 per cent) and animal welfare (25 per cent). The report also found that two in three (66 per cent) of people took part in a charitable or social activity, such as volunteering for a charity, donating money or goods, or buying an ethical product.  More than half (56 per cent) of those interviewed said they signed a petition in the previous 12 months, while 27 per cent had done so over the previous four weeks.  The report is based on a a survey of 1061 people in Scotland.    Sir John Low, Charities Aid Foundation chief executive said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to see the total amount donated increasing across Scotland. Activism is also on the rise, perhaps re\u0026#64258ecting the turbulent times in which we live. This paints a picture of a thriving, vibrant society of which we should all be proud.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos easy to take the work of our charities for granted \u0026ndash indeed CAF\u0026rsquos research over many years shows that millions of people benefit from their work without even realising it. But this report shows how much people value good causes. Without the support of these generous donors, we would all be so much the poorer."},{"url":null,"title":"Country walks  spas and fitness suites    welcome to the perfect place to retire","story":"              IT has been billed as Scotland\u0026rsquos first purpose-built retirement community and is predicted to change the way people live in their later years when the worries of work are behind them.  Plans have been unveiled for a new village designed to cater to the needs of the over-55s, with all amenities, facilities and services they require right on their doorsteps.  Developers say the \u0026pound55 million scheme, proposed for Netherplace reservoir in Newton Mearns, near Glasgow, would be based on a \u0026ldquovision of active later living, and would be self-contained and come complete with medical services, leisure facilities and shops within its environs.  And they hope it could become the blueprint for other communities across Scotland if it is given approval when it goes before the local authority for assent later this week.  The Netherplace Retirement Development is the brainchild of property developer Shazad Bakhsh and is being taken forward by the Glasgow and Singapore-based property company Scotsbridge Holdings.  It would see the construction of 252 homes on the 17-acre former industrial site, made up of one and two-bedroom flats and cottages alongside a central \u0026ldquoclubhouse.  It would also incorporate a clinic and an 80-bed care home, as well as a fitness suite, spa, restaurant, community spaces and country walks.  Investments would be made in the very latest in information technology to provide the highest standard of support services for residents.  Mr Bakhsh believes Netherplace could become one of the most innovative new communities for over-55s anywhere in the UK, and provide further inward investment to East Renfrewshire.  He said: \u0026ldquoNetherplace will be so much than a retirement development, it will create a vibrant new community.  Herald View: Older people need better housing options too  Scotland is facing a demographic time bomb in the coming decades, with the number of pensioners expected to soar by almost 30 per cent in the next 25 years to 1.36 million by 2039, according to official figures from the Registers of Scotland.  Meanwhile, the number of over-75s is predicted to rise from 430,000 to about 800,000, while the working population paying taxes to meet the growing cost of public services is predicted to grow by just one per cent.  This will inevitably greatly impact on council budgets and the public purse, but Mr Bakhsh said that similar retirement communities help councils shoulder the burden by having services grouped together.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe believe this project will ultimately reduce the burden on local authority care provision by providing residents with more intermediate care options.  \u0026ldquoThis is an opportunity to create a community in the truest sense of the word and tackle preconceptions of what a retirement development can be.  \u0026ldquoThe placement of these bespoke lifetime homes, with facilities which are second to none, will ensure a higher quality of living.  He added: \u0026ldquoOur professional and experienced team has a vision to modernise the sector and provide a development to both answer demand and exceed expectations.  Herald View: Older people need better housing options too  An independent economic impact study of the project estimates that the development will support more than 365 permanent jobs during the next 30 years, and contribute more than \u0026pound74m to the local economy .  It is also hoped that the purpose-built retirement community could help release much-needed housing stock elsewhere by allowing pensioners living in larger homes to downsize.  Netherplace reservoir, which dates back to 1850, will be incorporated into the overall design of the village and stocked with trout for fishing.  Demolition and clearance of the site, a former dye works which last operated in 2003, has already been completed to enable works to begin if planning permission is granted.  The development would be built across the road from Whitecraigs Rugby Club and immediately adjacent to the M77 motorway. A similar scheme was refused in 2015 amid objections from the community, social health and care partnership and Glasgow Airport.  Glasgow based practice Jewitt \u0026amp Wilkie Architects has been appointed to design the development. Founder Jonathan Jewitt said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove carried out thorough and extensive research on aspirational, high quality homes and engaged with numerous public and private bodies to achieve the optimum scheme proposal.  \u0026ldquoThis proposal includes a wide variety of unique features which have been subtly future-proofed to cater for the changing needs of residents.  \u0026ldquoIt is expected that housing currently occupied by one or two persons within the surrounding community will be released into the market for much-needed family housing."},{"url":null,"title":"Edinburgh wants to oust Sydney as best place to see in New Year","story":"              AS the first major city to welcome in the New Year, Sydney proudly boasts that it is hosts the most talked about party in the world.  But now organisers of Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Hogmanay event are gunning for the number one spot and hope to topple the Australian city from its perch.  The capital\u0026rsquos Hogmanay celebrations attracted 165,000 people last year, and had an economic impact of \u0026pound39 million, a new report states.  However, Underbelly, in its second year running the three-day event, wants Hogmanay to be the most talked about New Year celebration in the globe.  Around 10,000 more people, from 80 countries, attended the last Hogmanay event compared to 2017, and the organisers believe there still room for Edinburgh\u0026rsquos three-day New Year festival to grow.  Charlie Wood, director of Underbelly, said: \u0026ldquoOur plans aren\u0026rsquot about increasing that number of visitors, it is about increasing how Edinburgh and Scotland are viewed internationally.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos about creating an event that is talked about, not just in the city, that notion of \u0026lsquoOh why wasn\u0026rsquot I there?\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos the goal, its about creating those images and stories, that really sell the city and the country internationally.  Underbelly said its own research shows that Hogmanay generated 37 TV news pieces reaching 89 million viewers, 201 radio pieces reaching 141 million listeners, and more than 2,000 online articles reaching more than 10 billion readers, with 360 pieces in print. These figures helped lift Edinburgh from the 17th most covered New Year event in 2017 to joint 7th this year.  However, the short term aim, Mr Wood said, is to break into the top five, with a long term aim of being the most-visible New Year event in the globe.  The research shows the top New Year celebrations being covered internationally are Sydney at no 1, followed by Seoul and Hong Kong at joint 2nd, followed by New York, Singapore, and Paris, and then London and Edinburgh at joint seventh, followed by Tokyo, and Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur, Manila and Moscow at joint 10th.  Mr Wood added: \u0026ldquoIt cannot be an exact science, but it helps build a picture about how the world looks at Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoAnd our goal is to make sure that it beats every other city in the world as the city that everyone talks about - which is creatively we try to make it as different as possible.  \u0026ldquoThe aim is to get images and stories, about Hogmanay and about Scotland, all around the world.  The economic impact figure is 40 per cent higher than the last measurement, in 2010, of \u0026pound27.9m.  The last Hogmanay was the first staged by Underbelly for the City of Edinburgh Council, after being run by Peter Irvine\u0026rsquos Unique Events for more than 20 years.  Ed Bartlam, co-director, said: \u0026ldquoWe didn\u0026rsquot set out to throw away what was already great about the event, we kept that, Peter Irvine did so much brilliant stuff, we just wanted to turn it up a notch, and that\u0026rsquos what we want to continue doing for the next few years.  Research conducted by BOP Consulting also surveyed 5,236 attendees and found that Hogmanay was the main or only reason for visiting Scotland for 71% of attendees from elsewhere in the world, 74% of whom were attending Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Hogmanay for the first time.  Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Hogmanay is principally funded by City of Edinburgh Council.  More than one-third of Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Hogmanay 2018 income came from public sector funding and 66% was from commercial sources of revenue including ticketing and sponsorship income.  Charlie Wood and Ed Bartlam added: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore delighted by the increased economic impact of the event on Edinburgh and Scotland to be an event that both encourages people to visit and creates employment in the city to have people from 80 countries buy tickets for the event but also see a strong local audience that engages and participates.  Ticket for Hogmanay 2019 are already on sale.  Councillor Donald Wilson, the culture convener for the City of Edinburgh Council, said: \u0026ldquoUnderbelly certainly didn\u0026rsquot fail to impress in their first year producing the event and this report highlights just how much of a success the festival was with a whopping estimated economic impact of \u0026pound39.8m for Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"Bottle or breastfeeding  Woman   s choice must be respected  midwives told","story":"              Women who decide not to breastfeed their child must be respected for their choice, midwives are being told.  Updated advice from the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) stresses that new mothers should be given appropriate support if they make an informed decision to bottle feed.  The new guidance still says babies should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of their life, in line with advice from the World Health Organisation (WHO).  But the RCM has acknowledged that some mothers struggle to start or carry on breastfeeding, and says the decision is a woman\u0026rsquos right.  Chief executive Gill Walton said: \u0026ldquoEvidence clearly shows that breastfeeding in line with WHO guidance brings optimum benefits for the health of both mother and baby. However the reality is that often some women for a variety of reasons struggle to start or sustain breastfeeding.  \u0026ldquoThe RCM believes that women should be at the centre of their own care and as with other areas of maternity care, midwives and maternity support workers should promote informed choice.  \u0026ldquoIf, after being given appropriate information, advice and support on breastfeeding, a woman chooses not to do so, or to give formula as well as breastfeeding, her choice must be respected.  The National Childbirth Trust has previously warned that women can face judgment or feel guilty about the decisions they make when it comes to feeding their baby.  But the RCM says it recognises that \u0026ldquosome women cannot or do not wish to breastfeed.  \u0026ldquoThey must be given all the advice and support they need on safe preparation of bottles and responsive feeding to develop a close and loving bond with their baby, Ms Walton added.  \u0026ldquoWe know that every woman wants the best for her baby and we want to be able to empower our members to support women to be the best they can be and enable them to make decisions that are right for themselves and their babies.  The organisation also says those who choose to breastfeed need more support and should not feel \u0026ldquoguilty of embarrassed about breastfeeding in public.  Research has found breastfeeding can have long-term health advantages, with children less likely to develop diabetes or become obese later in life.  But the UK has one of the lowest breastfeeding rates in the world. A recent report found just over a third (34%) of babies are receiving any breast milk at six months, compared with 62.5% in Sweden."},{"url":null,"title":"MPs to question leading Brexiteer Arron Banks over Russia links","story":"              Prominent Brexiteer Arron Banks has insisted there is no evidence the anti-EU campaign took Russian money as he faces a grilling form MPs.

The Royal Court Theatre\u0027s artistic director has curated eight filmed monologues for a BBC Four series to mark 100 years of suffrage as a collaboration between the theatre and the broadcaster.  But Featherstone, former artistic director of the National Theatre of Scotland, was as surprised as anybody when the BBC agreed to the suggestive title Snatches, which can be used as a derogatory slang term for a vagina.  She told the Radio Times magazine: \"It\u0027s reclaiming the word, isn\u0027t it?  \"It was my first idea, and I thought, \u0027There\u0027s no way they\u0027re going to let it happen,\u0027 but they (BBC Four) were rather amused by it.  \"And in terms of what we\u0027re doing with the monologues, it fits very well.

Featherstone said that each writer was able to make their own decisions as to what their stories, which will air in 15 minute-long episodes, would be about.  One of the monologues will be based on rape within marriage, while another - starring Garai and penned by Morgan - is about an actress\u0027s experience meeting a producer.  Featherstone said that working on the series has been a bit of a wake-up call in terms of gender equality.  She said: \"I\u0027m an incredibly optimistic person, but I think the shock, for all of us who worked on Snatches, is that things maybe haven\u0027t changed as much for women as we thought they had.  \"We think that everything has changed - and lots of change has happened - but we still have a gender pay gap, we still don\u0027t have equality, because equality, for some, feels threatening.  \"Snatches shows how things can shift.

However, the compromise is only likely to delay a full-blown showdown on the customs union until trade legislation returns to the Commons in July.  Mrs May set the tone for a tense two days as she warned Tory Remainers that if they defied her and backed Lords amendments to the landmark Brexit legislation it would weaken Britain\u0027s hand at the negotiating table.  Addressing a meeting of the backbench 1922 Committee on Monday, ahead of the key votes, she said: \"I am confident I can get a deal that allows us to strike our own trade deals while having a border with the EU which is as frictionless as possible.  \"But if the Lords amendments are allowed to stand, that negotiating position will be undermined.\"  However, Devon Tory Sarah Wollaston signalled on Tuesday morning that she would back Mr Grieve\u0027s amendment.  Dismissing the Government\u0027s compromise, she tweeted: \"Merely issuing a statement in response would make it a meaningless final vote.  \"Grieve\u0027s amendment puts that right and in a way Govt could and should accept it.\"  She said unless there was a \"meaningful vote\" Parliament would be left with \"the grim choice between a poor deal and exit with no deal at all\".  It would also give hard Brexiteers the chance to \"scupper a good deal\", she claimed.  Sir Oliver defended his compromise agreement, saying it was \"sensible\" in delaying a vote on the customs plan until details were more settled.  Asked on Today if the amendment \"just kicked the can down the road\", he replied: \"That is a very sensible thing to do.  \"If you are engaged in trying to sort something which is complicated out, it makes sense to do it when you know what the thing that you are debating looks like.\"  Meanwhile, Ireland\u0027s premier raised the possibility of delaying Brexit to allow more time to negotiate the UK\u0027s exit deal.  Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said extending the March 29 2019 departure date was one of a number of \"different scenarios\" that could be pursued if a withdrawal agreement fails to materialise in the coming months."},{"url":null,"title":"Sir Angus Grossart gives   1m to the revamp of the Burrell Collection","story":"              THE Scottish banker Sir Angus Grossart has given \u0026pound1m to the restoration of one of the nation\u0027s leading museums.  Sir Angus, a businessman and banker, has given the money to the project to re-develop the Burrell Collection in Glasgow.  It is an unusual bequest, in that he is also the chair of the Burrell Renaissance, the team that is leading fund raising for the revamp of the museum, in the city\u0027s south side.  Thus far, more than 125 companies, trusts and foundations, and individuals have pledged financial support to the \u0026pound66m project.  The project to redevelop the building, which is currently closed to the public, still needs to raise \u0026pound3m.  Sir Angus, whose high profile positions in the past have included being chair of the National Galleries of Scotland, chair of the Fine Art Society, vice chair of the Royal Bank of Scotland, among others, said: \"Sir William\u0026rsquos gift is an international flagship for Glasgow.  \"Much has moved on since the initial priority of creating a home for the Collection.  \"The Burrell Collection now needs a real renaissance which will place the true significance of Sir William\u0026rsquos legacy and Collection within the international league where it should be set.  \"The challenge is highly ambitious, but what a privilege it is for our generation to be asked to rise to that call and to take forward this great inheritance.\"  He added: \"Glasgow has been defined by international aspirations and cultural reach.  \"Sir William entrusted his life\u0026rsquos work to the city he called home.  \"Mindful always of his wishes, we are seeking to secure much wider recognition of his vision and achievements.  \"We still have \u0026pound3 million to raise and we hope more people will help us and support this great opportunity.\"  Councillor David McDonald, chair of Glasgow Life, which runs the city\u0027s museums and galleries, said: \u0026ldquoFew collections command both the international respect and local affection that the Burrell enjoys \u0026ndash a remarkable legacy of Sir William and Lady Burrell\u0026rsquos gift to Glasgow that has enriched the city socially, culturally and economically.  \"This very generous gift from Sir Angus, along with his valued ongoing support and advocacy, will ensure that legacy will be appreciated for generations to come.\"  James Robinson, director of Burrell Renaissance, said: \"Sir Angus\u0026rsquos commitment to the project as Chair of the Burrell Renaissance has shaped its ambition and strategy from the outset.  \"We are enormously grateful to him for this hugely generous gift as further evidence of his passion for the Burrell Collection and his belief in its ability to reach global audiences for generations to come.\"  Current exhibitions of works from the Burrell\u0026rsquos Collection include Courbet, Degas, C\u0026eacutezanne\u0026hellip Chefs-d\u0027oeuvre r\u0026eacutealistes et impressionistes de la collection Burrell, at the Mus\u0026eacutee Cantini, Marseilles, from 18 May to 23 September this year, and a rotating series of exhibitions at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum."}]
