This is because while your teens and 20s are about dealing with your own problems, your 30s, 40s and 50s find you taking on everyone else’s. “Mate, forget the AA, you’re just about to become the Fourth Emergency Service,” explains Moran’s future self. “Your life’s about to become a call centre for people who are exploding.”Thus, in More Than a Woman – the sequel to the mega-selling 2011 book How to Be a Woman – Moran, now 45, takes a second look at womanhood, this time from the vantage point of middle age. Part memoir, part manifesto, it tackles such thorny issues as anal sex, smear tests, hangovers, teenagers, ageing parents, careers, the tyranny of the to-do list, big bums and the moment when your entire wardrobe seems to turn against you.The chapters are built around a day in Moran’s life and carved up into specific themes such as: The Hour of Married Sex The Hour of Physical Acceptance and The Hour of Counting All the Things a Woman Will Have by the Age of Forty, Which Show What She Wanted to Be, But Hasn’t Been – Yet. While the subjects can feel a little shoehorned at times, it allows Moran to provide snapshots of her daily routine and, as is her trademark, use them to make broader points about the general state of things.Those who read her newspaper columns will know that Moran – who is also a screenwriter and novelist ­– is great at the observational stuff. Elaborate metaphors abound: mothers are superheroes who, instead of shooting out spider webs or laser beams, grow new organs and start producing milk a child’s empty bedroom is, poignantly, an abandoned film set when everyone’s gone for lunch.She is also very funny, locating the absurd in everyday situations such as the spectacle of her husband sneezing “as if a portal to Hell has opened up in my loved one’s sinuses, and he is birthing a spiralling vortex of ebullient demons, one by one, through his nose, in a way that cannot be stopped until all his life-force is spent”. Elsewhere, meandering anecdotes are replaced by no-nonsense commands. “Do not marry a cunt,” Moran states in a chapter about working mothers. “The more their partners do – the more they engage in childcare and housework – the more those women fly,” she explains.Threaded through the narrative is Moran’s commonsense feminism, underpinned by the principle that if men aren’t having to put up with this crap, then neither should we. She also reserves the right to change her mind. Having once raised a disapproving eyebrow at women who got Botox injections, the author says she has now thrown out what she calls her “Botox Police Hat” and, having tried it herself, is a convert. She now sees it as a “face chiller”, the use of which is no more radical than microblading your eyebrows or getting veneers for your teeth.It’s perhaps inevitable that there are topics that remain out of reach to Moran. For instance, the chapter on tending to vulnerable parents is sympathetic but slim, largely because her own parents are in good health. The menopause is still a few years off for her, so it doesn’t figure at all. Give it another 10 years and this would doubtless be a different book ­– but no matter. Moran is at her best when writing about what she knows. The most obvious precursor to More Than a Woman is I Feel Bad About My Neck, Nora Ephron’s 2007 book in which she grumbled wittily about expensive handbags, her philandering ex-husband, failing eyesight and not having spent enough time in her youth wearing a bikini. But where Ephron’s impulse was to chronicle the often inglorious slide towards old age, Moran’s is, where possible, to celebrate and find value in it. Thus, she hails the friendships that have stretched over decades, her sudden appreciation of gardens, dog ownership and, yes, her ageing body. The delight Moran takes in her physical self – “the Womble-nose breasts that point downwards, one larger than the other my C-section scarred belly the Malvern Hills of my hips and thighs” – is a wonderful thing, though her wish that her female readers similarly adore their bodies may be a touch optimistic, given how deeply self-loathing can run among those conditioned to see beauty as their most vital asset.Clearly, Moran understands this. She has seen first-hand the catastrophically damaging effects of this demand for perfection through her own Instagram-loving children indeed, the parts about raising teenagers provide the book’s real emotional punch. At the age of 13, Moran’s daughter Nancy developed an eating disorder and began self-harming. The confusion, followed by alarm, followed by abject devastation felt by Moran and her husband is powerfully articulated, and sits in stark contrast to the larkiness elsewhere. We see Moran at her most serious and embattled, at sea in the face of illness and a child that she can’t reach. She wouldn’t be writing about this, of course, had Nancy not come out the other side and emerged a stronger and more resilient young woman. Whatever the calamity, Moran explains, “you outlive the bad times. Happiness comes again, eventually … Just by staying alive. That’s all you have to do. A year can pass so quickly. Your foot is on the accelerator now.”• More Than a Woman is published by Ebury (£20). To order a copy go to bookshop.

Discussions were under way with the government and private vessel owners, InfraStrata said.John Wood, the company’s chief executive, said: “The acquisition at this point in time is opportunistic for the company and one that should not be missed. It not only gives us a strategic foothold in mainland UK but also makes the overall business highly competitive in the smaller and higher ends of the shipyard market, respectively.”The Appledore Shipyard dates back to 1865, and has built more than 300 vessels, including some of the Royal Navy’s latest aircraft carriers.Ian Waddell, the general secretary of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, said: “The prospect of Appledore being reopened is great news for British shipbuilding and we welcome its purchase by InfraStrata.“Appledore played a vital role making the complex bows for the aircraft carrier and it could play a similar role building the future solid support ship which the government must build in Britain in order to invest in our regional economies and get the economy back up and running.”The GMB’s union regional organiser, Matt Roberts, said: “We are absolutely delighted with the confirmation that the yard will reopen. We have always firmly believed that the yard can be viable and thrive in the right hands.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb4d1780e1f6418d14e417151e11fe7e094b1a8d/0_97_5169_3101/master/5169.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9251ff8108caa6a3e41b57ab1f845c4c","title":"eat out to help out 64m meals claimed in uk under scheme","story":"The “eat out to help out” scheme encouraged more people into UK restaurants last week, taking the total number of meals claimed since the beginning of August to more than 64m – the equivalent of one for nearly every person in the country.The figures released by HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs suggest the scheme – where diners can claim a half-price discount up to a maximum of £10 per head on food and non-alcoholic drink on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays in August – has provided a much-needed boost for the embattled hospitality sector.In the run-up to the end of the scheme next week, the chancellor said the figures demonstrated how popular it had been so far, with 10.5m meals claimed in the first week, rising to 35m in the second and 64m by the third.“Today’s figures continue to show that Brits are backing hospitality – with more than 64m meals discounted so far, that’s equivalent to nearly every person in the country dining out to protect jobs,” Rishi Sunak said.He said the scheme, announced in his summer statement in July, had helped to protect the jobs of almost 2 million people working in hospitality, adding: “This scheme has reminded us how much we love to dine out.”Restaurants, pubs and cafes apply the discount to a customer’s bill and then claim the money back from the government.In a reflection of its widespread take-up, HMRC said £336m had been claimed so far, indicating that consumers were receiving a discount of about £5.25 per head on average.However, the bill for the Treasury is expected to rise further, with potential to surpass the £500m Sunak had originally budgeted for, as claims are expected to keep rolling in from the 84,000 outlets taking part until a deadline for submissions at the end of September.With the UK economy in the deepest recession since records began, Sunak has come under pressure to extend the scheme to support hospitality firms. Some venues are, however, planning to continue offering discounts once the scheme ends.According to Sky News, the Grosvenor Estate, which owns property in London’s West End, plans to cut rents for restaurants in its buildings that apply £10 per head discounts until the end of September.Visitor numbers to smaller cities and seaside towns have increased most as a result of the scheme, according to a study by the Centre for Cities thinktank. However, the continued absence of office workers from many big cities has meant places like London and Manchester have benefited least.Restaurants, bars and cafes were among the hardest hit businesses by lockdown, with a higher proportion of hospitality workers furloughed than in other sectors.Despite warnings that encouraging people to eat out would accelerate the spread of the virus, the scheme is designed to boost trade as the furlough scheme is wound down."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed0eb1829de75d971dcdf2e83348bc34185d18cb/0_293_3076_1846/master/3076.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2fb633f8777391e740aaa05176f969b","title":"jack mas mobile payments firm ant group plans floatation","story":"Hong Kong and Shanghai IPO could raise $30bn, valuing firm at more than $200bn The Chinese billionaire Jack Ma’s mobile payments firm has announced plans to float on the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges in a move that could value the company at $225bn (£169bn).Ant Group could raise as much as $30bn in the flotation, which would make it the world’s largest initial public offering, overtaking the $25.6bn raised in the Saudi Aramco IPO in December 2019.The group’s best-known business is Alipay, the largest player in China’s 430tn yuan third-party mobile payments market, according to the market research firm Qianzhan.

Why is she being subjected to a regime that potentially infringes her civil liberties?Britney Spears is 38 years old, but she might as well be eight. The pop star hasn’t had full control over her life for more than a decade legally speaking she has about as many rights as a child. Ever since a public breakdown in 2008, Spears’ autonomy has been suspended by a complex legal arrangement known as a conservatorship.For most of this time, her dad, Jamie Spears, has taken control of her affairs – and has been compensated to the tune of more than $100,000 (£75,000) a year for doing so – but he temporarily stepped down last year for health reasons. Spears doesn’t want him back: the singer recently requested he be permanently removed from the conservator role. On Monday a judge ruled this wouldn’t be decided until 2021 the conservatorship will continue until then.While the exact details of Spears’ conservatorship are unclear, the bottom line is that a court has determined she is incapable of making her own decisions. She is more than able to make money – she played 248 shows during her 2013-17 Las Vegas residency, getting $500,000 a gig – but not to freely spend it. Every single purchase she makes, even a coffee, is tracked in court documents and scrutinised. According to some legal experts, it is unusual for someone as young and industrious as Spears to be subject to a conservatorship: they are usually intended for people with conditions such as dementia, where there is little hope of getting better.A growing #FreeBritney movement believes the singer is being exploited her dad says that’s nonsense, he just wants what’s best for Spears and her $59m fortune (as it stood in 2018). But even if he does have her best interests at heart, the sweeping powers a conservatorship grants, and the extent to which these can be exploited, should alarm us all. It has certainly alarmed the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). “People with disabilities have a right to lead self-directed lives,” the ACLU tweeted last week. “If Britney Spears wants to regain her civil liberties … we are here to help her.” As the ACLU has noted, there are far less draconian alternatives to conservatorships that can support vulnerable people. The situation that Spears is in is clearly toxic. I don’t know about you, but I’m team #FreeBritney."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad2ba91c551566b322ed043bf99f2bbbce001f90/0_38_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1c18f316971feaa351c3eee81f23aa2","title":"teachers and parents share your thoughts on face coverings in uk schools coronavirus","story":"We want to hear whether you or your children will be wearing a face covering in school to reduce the spread of coronavirusSecondary school pupils in Scotland have been advised to wear face coverings if it is impossible to physically distance, from Monday.

Email feast@theWhat should I be making batches of now, while it’s still summer, to add flavour to my winter cooking?Ben, SouthportLife is always better when sweet tomatoes and peaches are at hand, so it’s eminently sensible to want to feel their love in the winter dearth, too. August and September are the golden months for preserving a summer glut, so fill your boots and get sterilising those jars.As to what you should be preserving, the short answer, says Kylee Newton, author of The Modern Preserver, is “whatever you can get your hands on”. Tomatoes, however, are a good place to start. She blanches them whole, then peels, cores and covers in a large pan with salted water and boils for five minutes. “Sterilise one-litre jars and add a tablespoon of lemon juice and a teaspoon of sea salt to each,” Newton says, “then pack the still-hot jars with the drained, cooked tomatoes, leaving a 3cm space, cover with the hot cooking brine, 1cm from the rim, and seal with hot lids.”For longevity, Olia Hercules, author of Summer Kitchens, adds a little dash each of raw or good-quality vinegar and oil to jars of brine (25g salt to one litre water), garlic, allspice berries, dill and cherry tomatoes (this works with chillies and peppers, too). All tomatoes are welcome to Hercules’ preserving party: “Big, small, green or firm are also good, so if you’re growing them and they don’t ripen, not to worry.” These “flavour bombs” can then be used as a pickle, blitzed up into a sauce, added to broths (“to give acidity”) or, my personal favourite, “as a snack with vodka”.Courgettes are another go-to for Hercules: “They’re fantastic grated, or sliced thinly, and added to caramelised onions. Just cook it all down until it turns into a paste.” She stores in jars with a little oil on top, then uses as a pasta sauce, in stews, or simply spread on toast.“Stone fruits are also amazing,” Eagle says. “You can cook, dry, freeze or bottle them.” A sweet pickle, though, comes out tops: “Make a syrup but with vinegar – half sugar, half mild cider vinegar – then cook the prepared fruit in that for 30 seconds to a minute, or pour it hot over cherries and leave to steep.” The result? Sweet pickled fruit that’s mild enough to use in desserts but tangy enough to sit alongside cold meats and cheese. “You’ve also got the sweet vinegar, which you can use as a shrub for cordials and cocktails,” Eagle notes.Hercules is also a fan of stone fruit. “In Ukraine, we’re big on preserving peaches whole,” she says. “They’re so easy: make a sugar syrup. add interesting herbs such as lemon verbena or vanilla, then poach them whole. You’re basically making tinned peaches.” Her top serving tip: slice and add to a homemade cake with cream, or folded into the batter. Sounds just, er, peachy.• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

The Argentinian, who lost his job as the manager last November – or, in production terms, midway through episode one of the nine-part series – was not slow in telling Daniel Levy, the chairman, of his misgivings.It was a source of friction yet Levy was determined to press ahead. Perhaps, he was influenced by the money – Amazon paid Spurs around £10m – and, doubtless, his obsession with driving greater visibility for the club in north America came into it.Pochettino is not a fan of this kind of documentary for one simple reason. Footballers are not actors. They do not behave naturally when the camera is on them and so how can the product be authentic? Consequently, we have scenes such as the one at the training ground restaurant the day after Pochettino has been dismissed featuring the best supporting actor nominee, Jan Vertonghen.When Harry Kane says that he spoke to Pochettino the previous night, Vertonghen suggests he and his staff already knew.Kane explains that Pochettino was merely informed that he was “being sacked, you need to pack your things, you leave tonight”. Vertonghen shakes his head slightly and looks lost. And that’s a wrap.The first three episodes are fired mainly by Mourinho and the overarching theme is his mission to transform the Spurs squad from nice boys into “a bunch of cunts” – to use his phrase to harden their mentality to make them winners.Pochettino’s successor is shown settling into his office and unboxing a signed photograph from Vinnie Jones – the famous one in which the leader of Wimbledon’s Crazy Gang is grabbing Paul Gascoigne. “José, be good,” Jones has written. But Mourinho does not want that. He wants to have his rivals by the balls.Mourinho is shot on the training pitch with Davinson Sánchez. “You have balls?” he asks the central defender, who he faced in the 2017 Europa League final when he was in charge of Manchester United and Sánchez was at Ajax. United won 2-0 and Mourinho tells Sánchez that he and his Ajax teammates bottled it. Or words to that effect. “I won the game minute one,” he says with a smile.It has long been Mourinho’s trademark man-management trick – the insult packaged up in the jokey, blokey wrapper, designed to get a reaction. The best bits of the early episodes involve his relationship-building with Dele Alli.“Fucking lazy,” Mourinho tells the midfielder on his first day. “I am going to be a pain in the ass on you. And you are lucky because when I am a pain in the ass, it’s a good thing.”It was never going to be all or nothing with the documentary, rather how much? What would Spurs permit in the final cut? Would there be any controversy, any real juice? The short answer from the first three episodes is no, with the glaring omission being the lack of any Pochettino footage on the day he is dismissed. The rumours at the time that Amazon had it all or at least something are not borne out.We see Kane piping up in the postmortem after the December defeat at Manchester United to call out everybody for a repeated failure to stand up and be counted, which is good and, crucially, makes him look good like a true leader.We see Son Heung-min’s upset in the dressing room after his red card against Chelsea, indignation flaring before he sits down quietly, on the verge of tears. He later gives a nice-boy apology. We do not get any mention after the Everton game of Son’s involvement in André Gomes’s traumatic ankle break.Mourinho is allowed to dish it out, with one classic coming as the press officer, Simon Felstein, primes him to expect a question on betraying Chelsea at his media unveiling. “The betrayal is that I won three leagues for them and they sacked me,” Mourinho says.Christian Eriksen is expendable because of the nature of his January departure to Internazionale. “The problem we have with Christian is that none of us know what the real truth is,” Levy says to Mourinho. “His agent controls everything. And there is no dialogue between the club and his agent at all.”At one point, Mourinho says that he can try one more time to turn Eriksen. “At least then you know you’ve tried everything,” Levy adds. Memo to Spurs fans: we tried everything to keep him.It is all extremely polished but that is not to say it is not watchable and enjoyable. Where it scores points is in adding detail to established plotlines and characters. The depth of the respect that Mourinho has for Eric Dier is plain. Moussa Sissoko’s influence in the dressing room is talked up. Alli is good fun. Every Spurs supporter will tune in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f713efaee6fc8295a9f75b9733b94ac2a2ef7354/43_188_1663_997/master/1663.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=00e40cca4e1dd13bdad4e03ada418ad3","title":"lionel messi where next after decision to leave barcelona manchester city psg inter","story":"Europe’s elite are queuing up to sign arguably the world’s best player, but Messi may still surprise everyone with his next moveAs the minutes ticked by after the bombshell news that Messi wanted out of Barcelona, it was little surprise to see City emerge as early favourites for his signature. Pep Guardiola and Messi won two Champions Leagues together at Barça, and there may be a temptation to reunite for another tilt at the trophy.Guardiola has routinely said he hoped Messi would finish his career at Barça, but rumours persist in Spain that the duo have been in contact in recent days. City also have the financial means and the successful appeal against their two-season Champions League ban now looks like perfect timing.There are caveats, though defensive recruits are the priority this summer, and the club have tended to steer clear of signing players who are past their prime. Messi may be a different story – and reports that rivals Manchester United are also interested may force them into a quick decision.City’s stance is that Messi is a fabulous footballer and Guardiola remains an admirer of the best player he has managed. However there is a view that he is always linked whenever there are political murmurings at Barcelona and this may be the same. A watching brief then at the Etihad Stadium.In the aftermath of his team’s Champions League defeat by Bayern Munich, Thomas Tuchel found himself fielding questions about summer spending. Such is the life of a head coach at PSG, and the German admitted he would be seeking signings – but played down the prospect of bringing Messi to Paris.Tuchel has said his priority is reinforcing his defence and that he expected Messi to end his career at the Camp Nou, but added: “Which coach says no to Messi?” That implies that any decision will come from PSG’s Qatari backers, and the early indications are that they are keen to meet with Messi’s representatives.Barcelona fans have long anticipated a reunion between Messi and Neymar – it would be a bitter pill indeed if it were to happen at PSG, with Kylian Mbappé completing what could be an unstoppable front three.Something of a wild card among the clubs in the frame, Antonio Conte’s Inter side appear an odd fit for a player driven to despair by Barça’s Champions League failures. Inter haven’t won a trophy since 2011 but are emerging as a European force again.A move to Italy would also offer Messi the chance to resume domestic battle with Cristiano Ronaldo, whose Juventus side pipped Inter to the title last season. But could it really happen? The club’s former president Massimo Moratti believes the owner, Suning Holdings, wants to sign Messi, based on an unusual sighting.In 2018 Messi hinted that one day he could see himself at Inter. Inter Miami, that is. In a video congratulating him on getting an MLS franchise, Messi jokingly told the club’s owner, David Beckham, to “give him a call in a few years”.The Argentinian appears unlikely to answer that call just yet with Europe’s elite chasing his signature, but there are a few other options that could turn his head. One is a return to Newell’s Old Boys, the hometown club he left for Catalonia 20 years ago.A return to Rosario sounds romantic but Messi would have to accept a huge drop from his £500,000-per-week salary. Moves to reunite either with Xavi – the manager at the Qatari club Al-Sadd – or Andrés Iniesta at Japan’s Vissel Kobe look like long shots.The final option for Messi – and the one considered most likely by bookmakers despite Tuesday’s dramatic developments – is that he stays at Barcelona. Messi’s request to move on is genuine, and not thought to be a purely political move – and by demanding the club allow him to leave for free he risks an acrimonious legal battle from which there may be no coming back.That said, the fallout from Messi’s decision could mean the situation changes rapidly. The club president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, was already under severe pressure – and fans have been quick to take to the streets, calling for him to resign. The former president Joan Laporta, who was at the helm during Guardiola’s and Messi’s golden era, has added to those calls.If Bartomeu going means Messi stays, it would appear to be no contest – and the same might even be said for the new manager, Ronald Koeman. The Dutchman reportedly made a bold move in his first meeting with Messi, telling him his “privileges” at Barcelona were no more, and potentially forcing Messi’s hand. Koeman’s gamble is based on the notion that no player is bigger than the club. In Messi’s case, that may not be true."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90fc98d2c71d1f6d7a45c7c7346002c710c66db1/0_169_4200_2521/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb9ca030ba58f4922e0c0e6182994f2c","title":"africa triumph over wild polio shows the power of regional unity","story":"The legacy of a successful battle is now helping combat Covid, but we must stay vigilant, says WHO’s Africa regional director Africa has declared victory over a virus that once paralysed 75,000 children on the continent every year.Four years have now passed since wild polio was last detected in Africa. After a year of rigorously evaluating polio data from all 47 countries in the WHO’s African region, an independent body of experts announced during a virtual ceremony on Tuesdaythat the continent was free of wild polio.The magnitude of this achievement cannot be overstated. It should inspire confidence in Africa’s ability to overcome even the most formidable public health challenges.How we got here is a remarkable story that shows what Africa can achieve when its nations unite behind a common goal.Sixteen years and billions – yes, billions – of vaccinations later, Africa’s last wild poliovirus outbreak hit northern Nigeria. Recognising the risk, the region rapidly mobilised a response. With support from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), a taskforce was set up to help Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon, Chad and the Central African Republic coordinate and roll out an emergency outbreak response campaign to reach 45 million children.Multinational campaigns on this scale are extraordinarily complex. Each country’s surveillance and vaccination teams work to implement campaigns over vast areas, using detailed micro-planning to ensure every settlement is reached.The ersity of Africa’s terrain, cultures and languages, along with the disruption of health systems because of migration, conflict and climate change, have created additional challenges.Africa’s polio eradication programme responded to these obstacles by constantly innovating and adapting its strategies. The programme developed a unique technique to reach children in insecure areas of the Lake Chad basin. Special transit teams were established in fixed locations with heavy traffic, such as markets and border checkpoints. In 2017 alone, transit teams stationed in one Nigerian city vaccinated 299,000 children moving out of conflict-affected areas of Borno state.Reaching children in the most remote and insecure corners of the continent has not been easy. Some health workers lost their lives and I pay tribute to them. Their sacrifices have led us to where we are today.The infrastructure and expertise developed to fight polio have played a major role in strengthening other health services. In Chad, polio vaccination strategies are used to reach nomadic populations with perinatal healthcare and routine immunisation services. Across the continent, thousands of workers integrate surveillance for other diseases in their search for polio cases, which has helped scale up surveillance networks.Today, the polio programme plays an important role in Africa’s fight against Covid-19. Staff and resources are supporting countries to coordinate outbreak responses, educate the public and conduct contact tracing, data management and surveillance.But history tells us that we must remain vigilant. While the wild virus is no longer circulating in Africa, it continues to infect children in Pakistan and Afghanistan. In the early 2000s, international spread of wild polio from India to several African countries showed how easily the virus can reappear if we let our guard down. Until polio is eradicated globally, all countries need to maintain high population immunity levels.High vaccination rates are also needed to stop outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived polio (cVDPV), which can occur when not enough children receive the oral polio vaccine. Sixteen countries are currently experiencing cVDPV outbreaks and the pause in vaccination programmes during Covid-19 is expected to increase transmissions. But it’s encouraging that some countries have restarted cVDPV response campaigns, under coronavirus pandemic control guidelines.Tuesday’s certification ceremony – attended virtually by heads of state, health ministers, GPEI leaders and programme funders – was a moment to honour the heroic vaccinators, experts and community mobilisers who made this historic achievement possible. Amid celebrations, we must remember that this progress is fragile. We must redouble our commitment to keep wild polio out of Africa, and end cVDPVs.The path ahead will not be easy, faced as we are with the new obstacle of Covid-19, but we have overcome setbacks before. And we are now armed with expertise and infrastructure developed by the polio programme over decades, and proof that no challenge can shake the commitment of African leaders and people.The triumph over wild polio leaves no doubt in my mind that when we act together, Africa can achieve the most ambitious goals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2cde4fb218c544b2696ac0804dce74d377cce43/0_287_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdf3700971c7892d9db90d65e2161900","title":"hunger demand food aid soars across america amid job losses","story":"Nationwide the need for aid at food banks and pantries has surged amid worst unemployment rate in modern timesNeisha Davis cradles brown paper lunch bags in the crook of one arm, while holding on to Demitri, her wriggling baby son, in the other and keeping a careful eye on Naya, her four-year-old daughter, as she runs around the church car park with another little girl.It’s hectic but the free packed lunches have become a crucial part of their daily nutrition. So everyday at noon the family make the two-mile journey from Homewood, a low income predominantly African American Pittsburgh neighbourhood with no grocery stores, to the East End Community Ministry’s pop-up lunch stall in East Liberty.“The lunches help a lot, the food is healthy and it fills them up, the food stamps are never enough,” said Davis, 36, who has enough freshly cooked hot dogs, fruit pots, carrots, and milk and juice cartons for her eldest two children who stayed home.Once a week or so Davis also picks up groceries from the food pantry which provides fresh produce rarely available at her local convenience stores. “I was raised to be humble, and right now I’ve no work so I need help. The alternative would be my kids going hungry.”And it’s not just here: nationwide the demand for aid at food banks and pantries has soared amid unprecedented job losses and the worst unemployment rate in modern times.This pandemic has also exposed – and exacerbated – structural inequalities including access to affordable, nutritious food. Overall, almost half the city lives in a food desert – a neighbourhood with high rates of poverty and no supermarket within half a mile – but black residents are disproportionately affected.“There’s enough food, it’s about who gets access to quality food,” said Carlos Thomas, 29, one of the Pittsburgh’s few black cordon bleu chefs and cofounder of Feed the Hood, a project training young chefs and serving up nutritious meals to underserved communities in food deserts like Homewood.According to the census bureau, half of all adults – 105 million – reported feeling down, depressed or hopeless on at least several days during the third week of July. Then, one in nine Americans were reliant on unemployment benefits to cover living expenses.Davis used to worked 25 hours a week as a home healthcare assistant, helping the sick and elderly with shopping and meal prep while juggling school runs and daycare for her children aged one to 14.The lockdown made working impossible, however the family was better off as the federal stimulus cheque and unemployment benefit helped Davis catch up on bills, and buy some much needed furniture and shoes for the children – items she usually struggles to afford.At the end of July, the weekly $600 enhanced unemployment benefit ended for millions of Americans due to a partisan stalemate over the next federal stimulus bill. Senators went home for recess, but for ordinary people the money worries continued.“The money stopped but the bills won’t, and winter is coming so the gas bill will get really high, it’s very frustrating and worrying. I’m hoping the pandemic ends or the unemployment is sorted... until then I’ll have to juggle things, make the food last longer,” said Davis.“We don’t talk enough about the mental health implications of food insecurity, and the courage it takes asking for help,” said Lisa Scales, president of the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank.Unemployment figures suggest that the job market is recovering more slowly in the Pittsburgh and surrounding counties than the rest of the state and country.But it is not just the unemployed who are going hungry. Before the pandemic, the working poor made up a large proportion of food bank users. Now, competition for work is higher, with about 14 million more Americans unemployed than there are job openings, and more low wage workers are struggling.The coronavirus infection rate has recently stabilized in Pennsylvania, with 600 to 800 new cases each day, but experts fear a winter surge and Willis fears its consequences.“I’ve spent my money keeping up with bills, I need food … this is stuff the kids will eat, we’re now eating to survive,” said Willis. “My biggest concern is that we shutdown again and now there’s no unemployment.”It’s a blue collar, predominantly white, county hit hard by the opioid epidemic - a former Democrat stronghold where almost three fifths of voters chose Trump in 2016.The Faith Restorations pantry in Monaca currently provides food to a thousand or so people each week – compared to 300 before the pandemic. At the peak of the lockdown, as many as 3,000 people relied on the pantry for weekly groceries.On one night last week, volunteers had pre-packed 102 shopping carts of food with bagels, meat, coleslaw, milk, bananas and a party sized frosted cake. Everything was gone within an hour. The elderly, mostly maskless, volunteers scrambled to prepare more boxes, as dozens of cars waited in line.Among them was first-timer Marissa Campbell, 39, a school bus driver with two children, aged five and 12, who’s desperately worried about making ends meet without the federal unemployment cheques.“Honestly, I’ve broken down thinking about food. I’m here because I can’t let my pride stop me from doing what I need to do. Without this, I don’t know what I’d have done at the end of the week.”Campbell blames the Democrats for the impasse on the stimulus bill. “The Republicans were trying to help us, but the Democrats wanted to add unrelated things,” she said.Campbell’s youngest child Lilly has underlying health issues, but for financial reasons she is desperate to get back to work. “Half the county was shutdown but I don’t know anyone with the virus. It’s very stressful but we have to open back up, people have to live.”At times Wooley, 55, says he feels depressed and panicky about paying bills and getting a new job at his age, but would rather be poor than sick. He doesn’t have health insurance.“I believe the pandemic is true, a lot of people don’t, and I want my elderly parents to be able to live out their lives … I’ve seen enough scary movies to know that we’re screwed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/671d84ac15266aa60c24e4fd9e09d446c79f7d9d/0_34_5906_3543/master/5906.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=16d5d53fc355a9c06a787e3c701fd4d7","title":"carrie gracie leaves bbc after 33 years","story":"Gracie became a figurehead for women when she resigned in protest at pay inequalitiesCarrie Gracie has said she is proud to have “fought for a fair workplace” as she announced that she has left the BBC.The journalist said in a social media post it was “time to do something new” after being at the corporation for 33 years.She became a figurehead for women at the BBC when she resigned from her position as China editor in January 2018 in protest at pay inequalities.The BBC subsequently apologised for underpaying Gracie and reached an agreement over her back pay.A number of high-profile disputes over equal pay at the corporation followed, including the employment tribunal which found Newswatch presenter Samira Ahmed should have been paid the same as colleague Jeremy Vine for similar work.On Tuesday Gracie announced on Twitter that she has had her last day on air: “Proud of a few things: told the China story, fought for a fair workplace, gave away the back pay I won, wrote the book. But most of all grateful to audiences and brilliant colleagues.”The BBC tweeted a tribute to Gracie, saying “goodbye and good luck”. It added that she was “a distinguished journalist who’s made a hugely important contribution to the BBC over the last three decades.“We wish her all the best with her future plans now she’s decided to leave us.”A number of Gracie’s BBC colleagues and broadcasters also paid tribute to her after she announced her departure.Evan Davis tweeted: “What a fantastic three decades Carrie. You are a giant, really good luck with the next phase.”Martine Croxall, who presents on the BBC News channel, said: “I salute you, CG, as a friend and colleague and champion. It was a privilege to do battle with you.”Gracie said in 2018 that she would donate the backdated pay she received from the corporation to gender equality campaigning charity the Fawcett Society.The money was to be used to set up a fund for women who need legal advice on equal pay claims and to support the organisation’s strategic legal work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56f37e51f606ebe7dc66de075ab470ff414822fb/0_137_3579_2148/master/3579.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc8fac7795af3e501f936f5f0b609a65","title":"living in the uk are you planning to move out of a city or urban area","story":"We would like to hear from people who are moving to smaller towns or more rural areas and what their reasons areAre you planning on moving out of a city?Some have noticed an increase in people wanting to move out of cities amid an increase in home working and a desire for more outside space.Whether you are buying or renting, if you are moving out of a city centre to a more suburban or rural area, we would like to hear from you.

The pandemic has simply accelerated that transformation, he said ahead of a British Retail Consortium webinar on the impact of Covid-19.Even an industry that has weathered its fair share of storms has never seen an event of this size and significance, and it’s becoming clear that the rules of engagement are changing. As retailers navigate uncharted waters, these are the rules that matter right now:Put safety firstAbove all, responsible businesses have to prioritise safety, both for staff and customers. According to Kyle Monk, head of retail insights and analytics at the British Retail Consortium, retailers are working hard on both implementing safety measures and communicating them clearly. Luckily, technology is on our side when it comes to designing systems that put safety first, but not at the expense of the customer experience. He cites a technology company that has shop assistants available by video screen in-store. The remote shop assistants can engage with you in a similar way in which they would normally.While it may seem at first that the new retail environment will not make the most fun of shopping experiences, with creativity, innovation and by utilising tech, companies can get the balance right.Be collaborative“The scale of the pandemic and the speed with which we’ve had to adopt a new way of living has left many of us feeling uncertain – especially retailers,” says Andrew Lawson, senior vice-president EMEA for Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. The good news, however, is that a sense of optimism is emerging as businesses deal successfully with unstable operating conditions. “We’ve seen incredible stories of resilience coming out of the pandemic, as retailers and their suppliers band together to maintain the flow of goods,” says Lawson.This collaborative spirit will be important for the industry if it is to retain momentum, share best practice and agree about what support may be needed from the government. “It’s kind of unprecedented,” says Monk. “I don’t think, to be honest, any other industry is coordinating in the way that retail is at the moment.”PrioritiseWhile some retailers have launched e-commerce platforms in record time – one European chain that had around 1,000 stores but no e-commerce platform, managed to launch one in 13 weeks – Lawson suggests that incremental digital transformation might be the better way forward. Zendesk is finding that many of its customers are reluctant to invest time and money in total digital transformation when there is still so much uncertainty. “The priority is to identify solutions that can deliver returns on investment quickly,” he says. “For example, by looking at an omnichannel approach, you can bring all the information you have on a customer together in one place. This will provide your marketing and sales teams with invaluable insights.”Support your staffWe may never return to business as usual but, according to Lawson, companies can move forward by supporting and listening to feedback from staff. He also emphasises the connection between a happy and valued workforce, and the ability to be agile, scalable and resilient. “By helping employees adapt to new systems and processes through training and regular communication, and by really listening to feedback, the new styles and systems that we work under really can work for everyone,” he says.Appeal to your fansThere has never been a better time for companies to revisit their core purpose – building a trusted and valued brand. Research from Zendesk shows that customers have been more patient during the pandemic. While the volume of service requests and wait times have gone up, customer satisfaction remains fairly steady, indicating brand loyalty. Customers will support the brands that they want to succeed, says Monk.And Gibb believes successful retailers won’t have customers going forward, they’ll have loyal fans – people who care deeply about what that brand really stands for. For decision-makers in the retail business, who feel that the ground is constantly shifting beneath them, focusing on purpose could provide a much needed stable foundation.Things are changing fast.

Now everyone faces a new issue: how to return to some semblance of business normality.“The world of work – particularly how we think about work and how we think about where we work, has fundamentally shifted,” says coach and productivity expert Karen Eyre-White. “A lot of businesses have been in crisis mode. What we’re seeing now is them having to get back to a new normal with strategy, boundaries and structure in place.”Some things haven’t changed. As before, high productivity will be a priority – particularly given the gloomy economic predictions. Achieving it depends on motivation, training and technology, time management and support from others. But how can businesses make sure they have these essentials in place as we move out of lockdown and get back to work?Have clarity of purposeWith so much uncertainty around, business leaders need to reassure staff by projecting confidence and clarity wherever possible. “Try to be certain about as much as you can,” says Eyre-White, whether that involves scheduling regular catch-up meetings, or deciding the office won’t reopen until next year. Managers can boost their own productivity and that of their team by being clear about their priorities for any given day or week, and encouraging others to do the same.Aligning those priorities with the company’s objectives will keep even a remote team moving in the right direction, says Chris Bailey, author of Hyperfocus: How to Work Less to Achieve More. “The greatest challenge that businesses face in normal times is orienting what everybody’s working on toward what the purpose of the business is … and that’s still the case,” he says. “The more intentional we are about how we work and what we work on, the more productive we become.”Where priorities have changed, it’s important to communicate that effectively to staff, says Sarah Manning, senior HR director at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “I can’t imagine many organisations didn’t have to pivot in some way in lockdown. Leaders need to be really clear now about what the expectation of their teams are going to be and put in measures to help people adapt.”Empower staff to find their way of workingProductivity can be difficult to measure, but focusing on the tasks achieved rather than the hours someone is at their desk can boost efficiency. Despite reports that lockdown led to an upsurge in demand for workforce surveillance tools, Eyre-White says that such an approach is unlikely to be effective. “Inidually, everyone needs to do different things in order to be productive,” she adds. “I just do not see how a surveillance system is compatible with that.”Instead, businesses should be encouraging staff to find what works for them – some people might be most productive if they go for a walk in the morning, others might take short breaks after 45 minutes of focused work, while some team members might need to work around a young family at home.Projecting empathy for the circumstances many of us find ourselves in is important, says Manning. Particularly at present. “Life is crazy right now. I think employers need to acknowledge that.”Promote good communicationWhen it comes to managing virtual teams, good communication is key to ensuring staff feel supported and informed. “Once a company has made a decision, communicate it clearly,” says Manning. “You need to be careful not to go out with half a message and cause a whole lot of anxiety for people.”Keeping communication channels open can promote a culture of collaboration.Apps such as Zoom, Slack, other digital tools and internal help desks can help ensure “people still feel engaged, connected and therefore invested”, says Manning. Zendesk, for example, has held remote quizzes, yoga classes and Friday night drinks during lockdown. There are other examples of companies holding digital book clubs, remote murder mystery games, and scavenger hunts.“Anything you can do as a manager to foster meaningful connections between employees will go a long way,” Bailey says.It’s OK to have down timeStaff may be working from home, but it’s important not to encourage an “always on” culture that blurs the boundaries between work life and home life, Eyre-White says. “There’s this idea of e-presenteeism and needing to be seen,” she adds. “Staff can’t be seen in the office so they may feel they need to be replying to their emails or messages instantly. And that’s not how you get productive work done. You need time away from those things. Businesses need to be clear that it’s OK.”One way to set the tone is to offer training to managers to help them adapt to working with, and supporting, remote teams. Simple measures can set an example, such as resisting the temptation to email outside work hours, and blocking out time for breaks on a calendar that the team has access to.No one should feel guilty about taking a break from work, says Bailey. “Focusing on things all day long is one of the worst things we can do because our mind just needs a chance to wander. Mind the guilt that you experience around relaxation and know that it’s a phenomenon most of us experience.”Embrace flexibilityAlongside the difficulties of the past few months, for many firms there have also been opportunities for lasting change.“If going remote didn’t kill a business, companies are going to have to decide their answer when employees ask: ‘Can I work from home?’” Manning says. “There are huge benefits from a cost perspective … and I do think companies can potentially attract more candidates and more ersity.”Staying flexible – and that might mean some staff work remotely in the long term – will help foster an inclusive, productive culture that has broader benefits.“This has definitely opened our eyes up to those different possibilities,” Manning adds. “We are going to have a much more flexible approach to where people can work and how they work.”Things are changing fast.

A huge drop in sales during March seemed to sound the death knell for at least some sectors of the industry. Online sales, on the other hand, have rocketed and new approaches are emerging among those retailers that are learning to be agile.“Covid-19 has really accelerated a bunch of inevitables. A lot of things are just happening a lot faster,” says Steve Hewett, global vice president for retail customer experience at the tech and consultancy firm Capgemini.For many companies, online is exploding. “This was already happening,” says Hewett. “But some companies are achieving the sort of online growth in weeks that they expected in three or four years.”This has implications for how companies do business, and it’s likely to be crucial to be able to deliver a hybrid onlineoffline experience to the post-Covid-19 customer. Here are five trends currently reshaping the retail sector:Brands are getting chattierIt seems that customers engaged with brands more during lockdown. “For years, buying something meant going to a physical place, seeing the branding in the store and understanding who that brand is,” says Adrian McDermott, president of products at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “We need to establish the digital equivalents of finding, meeting and having those conversations.”Prices could remain “sticky”Rajesh Bhargave, a consumer behaviour expert, suggests that retailers need to be wary of changing their prices – whether up or down. “Consumers tend to remember what they paid previously and would view price increases as unjust in poor economic conditions.”Dropping prices is not always the answer either. Many consumers will have taken a financial hit and their wallets will be closed for concessionary spending. A knee-jerk reaction might be to cut prices to bring back that demand but, says Bhargave, associate professor of marketing at Imperial College Business School in London, this could have negative long-term effects and erode pricing power: “If you’ve been paying £10 for a meal and suddenly that’s £8 you start to wonder about the quality of the meal.”Brands have to add valueInstead of dropping prices, brands are likely to start looking at different ways to add value, says Bhargave. “If people want to dine at restaurants, they might want a more private and safe experience,” he says. “So how can you start offering a different service that charges a higher price and offers better value?”Video calling is another area that business is only starting to explore. “With so much taking place on Zoom, is there a higher-end service you can provide in this area?” Selfridges, for example, is offering online beauty and styling appointments, with products then delivered to customers at home.This is part of a move towards getting more revenue from fewer people, and appointments for in-store shopping also fall into this category. “It’s all part of offering a more customised, high-end experience,” says Bhargave.To bring the joy back into shopping, some stores are putting their energies into their window displays to encourage browsing and others are providing queue entertainment.The need for a new kind of agilityThings may never be the same. “We’ve almost got to hit the reset button,” says Hewett. “People are returning to school and the office and there’s no playbook on what the wants and needs are.” Moreover, whatever they are could change dramatically again. Hewett adds: “There’s an organisational need for agility that wasn’t there before, as brands aren’t able to be as tactical as they would like.”Things are changing fast. But you can be faster.

Despite government support, having to close their doors for months had a crippling effect on many and forced them to take action to keep afloat.For Steve Sanderson, founder of the independent menswear retailer Oi Polloi, lockdown pressed fast forward on an already tough situation for small businesses. The company’s store in Manchester has always been at its heart, but it also has a strong online and social presence. “Bricks and mortar operations are really difficult,” he says. “What’s going on at the moment is sort of a super fast wormhole journey into the future.”Sanderson says that things are going to be particularly tough for fashion stores, with an inevitable drop in footfall, plus the issues of being Covid-19-secure, such as being unable to let customers try on clothes unless the items are quarantined or cleaned afterwards. “If people can’t try things on, why would they come in to a clothes shop?” he asks.There are, though, some rays of hope. “We have a good connection with customers through our bricks and mortar business, and certain people will always like that. But we can’t afford to just be open – we have to find a way of making it work.“We’ll have to adapt and become something else, something people can’t get from anywhere else. I like the idea of click and collect because you can do something quite interesting with that. You could then also narrow down the time the store itself is open.”For Michelle Drew, co-founder of Established 25 Atelier, which sells fashion and home accessories, the coronavirus crisis forced her to reassess her ambitions. Before lockdown, Drew, who started in 2017 making scarves and bags for friends and family, was selling at a quarterly design market in Greenwich and had a monthly stall at Spitalfields market. When Covid-19 brought things grinding to a halt, her first thought was that she needed to get her website up and running, and really engage online. “I didn’t have a choice,” she says.Since then, Drew has joined online workshops and used the time to rethink her plans. “Previously, I thought I’d love to collaborate with other designers and have a premises. I’m now wondering if that’s the way forward, because so much has changed and I’m not sure things will ever be the same.”While Drew plans to return to physical selling at some point, she sees her business relying more on online trading. “It’s still a precarious situation. I definitely will return to the markets because I enjoy the contact, but I’m looking at other ways to move the business forward.”Bigger retailers, too, have faced challenges, for all their greater resources. Some have come through with flying colours, though, particularly if they had the right technology to hand.For Tesco, the coronavirus crisis brought an unprecedented surge in demand, but the company was well placed to react quickly. It already had emergency plans in place thanks to a “doomsday” management exercise four years ago. It had also embraced remote working, and had the technology to handle communication with 460,000 staff, suppliers, people services and security operations. These systems allowed the company to double its capacity for delivery and click and collect in just six weeks. Improvements to the computer algorithms used to drive picking technology – plus the army of pickers hired to cope with the increased demand – mean that whatever the future brings, the chain appears to have the flexibility to deal with it.Similarly, the online flower delivery company Bloom \u0026amp Wild proved its resilience. For its founder Aron Gelbard, protecting jobs by staying open was important, as was providing people with a way of showing they care for the loved ones they couldn’t see in lockdown.With its tailored CRM system, which manages queries from a range of channels, Bloom \u0026amp Wild now employs more than 25 customer service agents who manage between 3,000 and 3,500 inquiries every week – rising dramatically during peak times such as Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day and, undoubtedly, lockdown.The company uses Zendesk to manage its customer relationships, allowing agents to deal with inquiries across Twitter, email, phone, online chat, Facebook Messenger and SMS. Alongside this, analytics help the company forecast customer demand and plan for peaks.As a business that exists purely in the virtual world, it’s an example to retailers everywhere of what can be achieved by clever use of technology.Things are changing fast.

Test and trace analysis has shown that two of the Wakefield players will also be required to self-isolate: but their fixture against Warrington Wolves this weekend is expected to go ahead as things stand.The Dragons, however, will not play Wigan as planned on Saturday, meaning the competition has once again had to move its fixtures around, a fortnight on from Hull FC and Salford standing down from their fixtures because of a series of positive tests at Hull.Wigan will instead play Castleford on Saturday, in a fixture which had been due to be played later in the season. The Tigers were originally set to have the week off but all clubs with a bye were instructed to be on standby in case of such an eventuality occurring. All other fixtures this weekend, as things stand, remain unaffected.The news that Super League has now been forced into a reschedule for the second successive round of fixtures will be concerning for those within the sport. The competition has the luxury of being able to play a number of games that are scheduled for later in the season as present, something which will become less of an option as the season rolls on.With the sport reliant on the multimillion-pound deal with the host broadcaster Sky Sports, the prospect of curtailing the season earlier than planned if repeated positive tests occur later in the season could leave clubs being forced to repay television money, which would leave many facing an uncertain future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ee7ac974930eb7f6030d25ba2af382746e8711b/448_418_2969_1783/master/2969.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f351d087bb6be3b0accfe39428ab62e","title":"talking horses why racing abroad could be key to british recovery plan","story":"The BHA’s published nine-point plan for racing includes its most pressing one: a full return to race-day activityAn extension of the Levy to cover bets on foreign racing could be worth between £30m and £40m a year as the sport in Britain recovers from the devastating economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic, Nick Rust, the chief executive of the British Horseracing Authority, said on Tuesday. “This is not a new idea but last year the need wasn’t as pressing for us,” Rust said. “The time is right now, because the sport’s facing a tough battle.”The plan is among the more immediate options in the recovery plan for racing published by the BHA, in conjunction with the sport’s major stakeholders in the Horsemen’s Group (HG) and the Race Course Association (RCA). Other proposals seek to attract and retain new owners, including via syndicates and a new agreement between the HG and RCA to maximise prize money in 2021, though the first of the plan’s nine “goals” is undoubtedly the most pressing: “To secure a full resumption of race-day activity, with the best possible ownership and spectator experience, and the maximum attendance possible.”“As well as Covid, we have Brexit coming up as well,” Rust said, “where government wants to ensure that we here in Britain aren’t going to be any worse off after Brexit. We do have competitor jurisdictions in France and Ireland where owners can relatively easily move their ownership interests where prize money is better. The playing field is not level.“Ireland almost certainly makes more money from betting on British racing as a horse racing jurisdiction than it does from betting on its own product, purely because that tax exists on all sports betting. Because we race seven days a week, they make more money out of us than they do out of our own product.In terms of a return of spectators to the racecourse, the Department of Culture, Media and Sport is expected to announce a series of pilots – from 1 October – with limited crowds in several sports, including racing, on Wednesday.“At the moment we’ve got a fixture list in place from September to December with more than three-quarters of races back at pre-Covid levels,” Rust said. “How many industries would like to be in that position? No one’s complacent, but it’s bought us some time to flesh out the detail of our plans.“The major tenet of the plan is to get crowds back, hopefully from 1 October, albeit the expectation is that those will be limited to 5,000 at that stage. But the vast majority of our race days would fall within that number, and even for the big days, it would provide an atmosphere and make it feel much more like our experience should be.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e43ca392bc23e56df3b67ac26f6371332501717/1110_542_3236_1943/master/3236.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTUucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=21d29734a9bf857278e2e22f51c81e14","title":"samsung galaxy buds live review novel bean shaped airpod rivals sound battery","story":"Pros: open fit, good battery life, great case, good sound, good controls, ANC, AAC support, seamless device switching, made of recycled plastic, can be repaired, batteries can be replacedCons: no noise isolation, ANC is limited, fit may not suit everyone, no water resistance"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2ceeca7e9687813e5d24db4ad8eca79059c75c6/640_388_4560_2736/master/4560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40b573f2a2850312efa1167643091b3b","title":"samsung galaxy book flex review long battery laptop with fold back screen","story":"Stunning royal blue convertible machine with hidden S-pen stylus marks re-entry into UK PC marketSamsung has returned to the consumer laptop market in the UK with a series of new machines led by the Galaxy Book Flex.Unlike most of the PC market, the Book Flex is refreshingly only available in one version in the UK with a choice of silver or blue, costing £1,349.The royal blue version reviewed here is simply stunning, with a deep blue aluminium body, lid and bottom, trimmed with silver sides. It certainly stands out against the crowd. The silver one is much more standard.The Flex bit refers to the screen, which folds all the way over to the back, making it a laptop that turns into a tablet. However, this isn’t detachable, meaning you’ll have the keyboard facing outward when folded into tablet mode. Weighing 1.16kg, it is pretty light for a laptop, but not for a tablet.It’s only 12.9mm thick, which means slipping it into a bag is easy, while build quality is top-notch, making it feel very solid. It compares favourably to the 13in laptop competition, including the Surface Laptop 3, Dell XPS 13 and Apple MacBook Pro.The keyboard is good. The good-sized keys are isolated and well-spaced with a reasonable amount of travel and feel. The trackpad is excellent – large enough, responsive and accurate, with a good click to it. The power button is on the side of the machine, rather than the deck, as are the speaker grilles.A fingerprint sensor handles biometric login with Windows Hello. It’s fairly big, fast and accurate, but its placement takes some getting used to as it takes up half the space usually dedicated to the right shift key.However, it is noticeably less crisp than higher-resolution screens of a similar size fitted to similarly-priced competitors such as the Surface Laptop 3, Apple’s machines and Dell’s 4K XPS 13.Having a 16:9 ratio makes it excellent for watching widescreen videos and movies, but it is less good for working on, simply because the screen isn’t that tall. That means you end up doing a lot of vertical scrolling as sites and documents don’t fit as well as on laptops that use a taller ratio such as 16:10 or 3:2.The Book Flex’s other trick is a concealed S-Pen stylus, which is the same one shipped with Samsung’s Galaxy Note series of large-screen smartphones. The stylus slides into a slot next to the Thunderbolt 3 ports and is stored neatly away until you need it. You push it in to release the stylus and then write on the screen. Like the recent Note 20 Ultra, you can use it like a magic wand by pressing a button and swiping it in the air in various directions to control apps for tasks such as skipping a track or adjusting volume.The Book Flex ships in one configuration in the UK, with a 10th-generation Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD, which are more or less the minimum requirements for top-end laptops in 2020.As such, it is a powerful, capable machine that can handle most things other than graphically intense gaming and professional video editing, which would require a higher resolution display.The Book Flex sailed through everything I threw at it, including fairly complex image manipulation in Affinity Photo on an external 4K monitor. It was generally cool-running too, with the fans occasionally audible at a low level, and the deck of the laptop becoming only slightly warm to touch. The feet on the bottom do not give it much ground clearance, meaning it was cooler when used on a hard surface rather than a soft table.The laptop also has a good selection of ports. It has two full Thunderbolt 3 ports on the right side and one USB-C only port on the left, which means you have more flexibility in your connection options when you have one port for power and another for a monitor. A microSD card reader, which can also take the faster UFS memory, is in the left side but unlike most competitors is contained in a sim-tray-like mechanism. You need a sim-ejector tool or long paperclip to access it, which lends itself more to storage expansion using a card you don’t remove, rather than as a traditional reader you just use briefly with a card you take out of your camera or similar.Part of that long battery life is the comparatively low-resolution screen, which consumes less power. Most of the competition have the higher resolution 3K or 4K screens, which are noticeably crisper than full HD.The Book Flex has a trick up its sleeve. The trackpad doubles as a wireless charger that can power a Qi-compatible smartphone, watch, headphones or other accessory. Of course you can’t use the trackpad when it’s charging something, so it’s of limited use, but could be handy for charging up a set of headphones or similar without reaching for a cable.The battery can be replaced out of warranty by authorised service providers. The laptop is not made from any recycled materials and while Samsung does offer trade-in and recycling schemes for other devices, it does not yet for laptops.The Book Flex ships with Windows 10 Home in the UK, with a few Samsung apps and tools installed, plus McAfee Livesafe, which I have had problems with in the past so uninstalled immediately, reverting to the built-in Windows Defender for anti-virus.Most of the Samsung apps are useful. The Samsung Settings app allows you to change a variety of features, including battery life-extending settings, booting options, audio and video effects, quick settings and a silent, low-performance mode. Samsung Update handles drivers and other bits, although so can Windows Update. There are tools for the S-Pen, a Quick Search app, a recovery tool for if things go wrong, and a security app that allows you to use your webcam to monitor login attempts to the laptop.Using the laptop was generally trouble-free, apart from one instance attempting to join a WebEx video conference. This caused the sound card drivers to fail, requiring a full removal of the sound card software and drivers to rehabilitate.The Samsung Galaxy Book Flex is available in royal blue or silver for £1,349.The Galaxy Book Flex marks a solid return to the laptop market in the UK for Samsung.It ticks most boxes, has a good amount of power on tap, long battery life, a good keyboard and solid build. The screen is colour-rich and bright, but its 16:9 ratio and relatively low resolution let it down compared with better-equipped rivals.The ability to fold the screen all the way over is not something I would routinely use, but is useful for folding up like an A-frame or for the occasional document markup using the included S-Pen stylus, which is excellent and neatly tucked away until you need it.The fingerprint sensor is great, but its placement, replacing half the right shift key, isn’t fantastic. It has three USB-C ports, of which two are Thunderbolt 3, which is better than some competitors that ship with just one or two. The microSD card reader is great for adding more storage, but less good for use for swapping cards in and out of cameras and the like.I like the laptop, I just don’t love it. But if you want a solid, flexible and adaptable convertible laptop, with long battery life and plenty of power, the Samsung Galaxy Book Flex is one of the best.Cons: 16:9 screen ratio, lower resolution screen, odd fingerprint placement in keyboard"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c33dbc0de30deb5cb63bc920b773e2ac2fdccee/0_221_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a3ec716c14819b0eb1139e50c7363d1","title":"wild travel adventure the midlands uk river swims campsites forests climbs ruins","story":"The authors of a new book on the wild side of Central England share their favourite secret spots for day trips and adventuresWalton- on-Trent, DerbyshireWith the backdrop of a village cricket green, this meander of the River Trent, backed by meadows and lined with willows, offers a retreat from modern life. Swim (or walk when water levels are low) to the little river island where a rope tree-swing is waiting. Nearby is one of the country’s newest wetland nature reserves, Tucklesholme, created in an old quarry. Spot oystercatchers and plovers, or hear a bittern boom. The village pub, The Swan, provides a mix of Asian and Italian food, with a huge wood-fired pizza oven at its heart.Getting there Walk downstream from the bridge 500m, or park at Tucklesholme nature reserve and follow the path around the wetland to a gate on the right near the river. Coordinates: 52.7651, -1.6851.Flowing through the meadows east of Studley, the River Arrow provides a secluded swimming hole under the shade of an ancient tree. The river is a short walk along the footpath leading down from the Norman stone church, with its intricate herringbone masonry. A fallen tree in the field makes a perfect picnic seat and is great for climbing.Getting there From Studley parish church, walk to the kissing gate along the lane to the right and follow the footpath down to the river. Coordinates: 52.2713, -1.8835.Slip into this part of the River Soar and (on occassion) float among the lily pads in the shades of the willows. The riverside walk passes twisted oaks and ancient meadows with several beach-y areas down to the river. At the Moorings pub, the riverside garden here has a small pontoon and is popular with canoeists – it is possible to boat down to the Navigation Inn on the other side of town. Nearby is the Swithland reservoir – no swimming but a secluded lake and nature reserve skirted by a pretty lane that is good for cyclingor an easy walk.Getting there From The Moorings pub, cross the river bridge then turn right along the river bank path for ⅓ mile. Coordinates: 52.7534, -1.1574.Here, the Jurassic Way meets the River Welland by a little bridge. A pebble beach shelves into a deep, wide pool, big enough for a decent swim. The old windpump is long gone but the tree-lined banks and distant views make this a picture-perfect swimming hole. If hungry, follow the river downstream, about six miles along pretty lanes, to find the Barrowden and Wakerley Community Shop, staffed by volunteers and stocked with homemade cakes and local picnic produce (shop open, cafe currently closed). More river pools and beaches can be found in the meadow behind, which is a short walk down Mill Lane. Getting there Take Ashby Road north from Middleton, signed for Ashley. After 600m at the bend, find the track and barrier and follow for 400m to the bridge. Coordinates: 52.5103, -0.7678.In steep, dense woods is this ghostly rock house complete with two windows and a door. Legend says the cave was created by a Derby baker, Cornelius, in the 12th century, who was called to live a life of prayer and solitude by a vision of the Virgin Mary. Inside, there is a cross etched on the back wall, a niche for a candle and a peephole for the inhabitant hermit to look out of. In fields nearby, a vast stone arch, once the east window, is all that remains of St Mary’s Abbey, founded here in 1200. Getting there From Dale Abbey village, follow the dead-end lane to All Saints church, then the footpath to the right that leads behind the church up through the woods. Coordinates: 52.9420, -1.3484.The remote ruins of this early Norman church are in a copse alongside the River Maun. The arched walls include lancet mullions and stone masonry. At sunset a golden light is cast across the ornate tombs and tumbledown stones, providing the ideal picnic location. The ruins are all that remain of the village of Haughton whose land was enclosed by the Sheriff of Nottingham in 1509. From here the Robin Hood Way leads to Elkesley Woods and a three-mile loop returns via Bothamsall. Getting there From the car park at the bend on the B6387, follow the path east along the river for ½ mile to ruins. Coordinates: 53.2494, -0.9657.Overlooking the Derwent valley, little remains of this 12th-century castle except fragments of the tower and sections of high walls. The motte-and-bailey site is surrounded by defensive rings of undulating earthworks, now covered in forest. Wild daffodils and bluebells carpet the woods in spring. Pop into Fresh Basil Deli in Belper, which stocks the award-winning Grumpy Farmer goat’s cheese. Getting there In Coxbench, turn right off the main road onto the lane opposite Horsley Lane by the A38 bridge and park. Walk on past the driveway to the left and follow the path into the woods. Coordinates: 52.9849, -1.4427.The beautiful Augustinian Priory of St Leonard was once home to the White Ladies, renowned for their habits, fashioned from undyed cloth. Along a wooded footpath, surrounded by countryside, the perimeter walls survive, together with a bank of seven Romanesque-style arched windows and finely carved column heads. This Tudor manor, a mile down the lane, is open to the public, and is famous for its oak tree in which Charles II is said to have hidden, in 1651. Getting there Seven miles east of Telford, turn off the A5 signed Boscobel House at the crossroads. Follow the road for 1½ miles to turn right to Boscobel House. White Ladies Priory is ¾ mile down the lane. Coordinates: 52.6656, -2.2582.This is a place of changing landscapes: snowdrops in winter, lichen-laden trees in autumn and flowering butterfly meadows in early summer. The wetlands were created by retreating ice sheets 10,000 years ago. “Kettles” gouged out by the ice later filled with water to create a mere (or moss). Nearby, Aqualate Mere is another large, natural wetland and good place to view birds and wildfowl.Getting there Follow the A519 one mile south-west from Woodseaves. Park in the layby on the left just after the bridge or use the car park on the right 250m further, both with paths into woods. Head north east to the wetland and snowdrops near the canal footbridge. Coordinates: 52.8175, -2.3149.This steep, picturesque ravine was landscaped by one of Capability Brown’s most famous students, William Emes. Part of the grounds of a long-lost country house, Badger Hall, a circular walk now weaves its way around an ornamental lake, through woodland and by streams. The prize is a network of caves and follies, carved out of sandstone outcrops to create a romantic garden at the bottom of the chasm. Getting there From St Giles church in Badger, walk 300m south to the footpath sign into the woods. Coordinates: 52.5908, -2.3445.Hay Wood is an ancient woodland interspersed with trails and bridleways. Muntjac deer are common, and dusk and dawn are great times to spot them.

Human contact is still largely outlawed, so if it all blows up in your face (as it can do, quite literally), it is socially acceptable to hide behind a mask. Besides, some studies have drawn a correlation between the hours spent looking-but-not-actually-looking at yourself in Zoom’s tiny thumbnail (were my eyes always this far apart? Or this close together?) and the uptick in cosmetic procedures post-lockdown.But, if you do decide to get a little Botox – and perhaps some tear-trough fillers, too, while you’re at it – you may have to contend with Dr Michael Mosley’s not-angry-but-disappointed face, as he visits a tweakment clinic near you in two-parter The Truth About Cosmetic Treatments (BBC One). Mosley, who is on most other TV shows where a bit of judgment is de rigueur (see also: Channel 4’s Lose a Stone in 21 Days) is here to see whether the rise in nonsurgical treatments could be doing more harm than good. But first, time to ask some people on the street whose fault this all is. The Kardashians and Kylie Jenner? I for one am shocked that some of the most famous people on the planet could be influencing our behaviour.The rest of the programme isn’t so much The Truth About Cosmetic Treatments as A Largely Negative But Ultimately Commonsense Guide to Them. Do use Google. Don’t get Botox in the back of a car. Do not pass go, do not collect £200. Co-presenter Mehreen Baig, a blogger and journalist, is mostly good cop, telling us that people should get tweakments if they want them and if they will make them feel better about themselves. She visits a doctor offering nonsurgical rhinoplasty, increasing the volume of noses with fillers while making them appear smaller. She listens kindly while a group of middle-aged women undergo newfangled microneedling and drink some kind of collagen Capri Sun to see if they can roll back the years. She even watches as fat is extracted from the body of a heavily sedated woman called Kim, to be harvested for stem cells, which are then injected back into her face. Sure, Baig is visibly revolted as she watches, but it could be worse: remember that period in the early 00s when it seemed as if every celebrity was drinking their own wee?Meanwhile, Mosley is, if not bad cop, then largely disapproving cop. He considers the pitiful case of Emma, a woman whose bungled lip filler left a huge pouch of skin around her mouth, which she describes, unappetisingly, as “the sausage”. People can do tweakments anywhere, with no qualifications, he reminds us, so it’s important to check out peoples’ credentials. The issue here, though Mosley doesn’t get into it, isn’t so much that people don’t go running to the General Medical Council before booking lip fillers, it’s that they trust a friend or acquaintance, and are tempted by cheap deals.If Mosley is the not-angry-but-disappointed parent, the kind who said: “Now, why have you gone and done that?” when you got your earlobes pierced, he at least decides to make his own apathy towards tweakments clear, undergoing a heat gun treatment to stimulate his skin, and then complaining that it has merely left him looking like he has “bad sunburn”.The second episode focuses on bum lifts and steroid-taking lads, and is sure – yet again – to hammer home the already well-known risks of doing anything other than sitting in a darkened room until the end of time. More helpful, perhaps, would be a programme that descended, if only slightly, from the moral high ground and stopped wrinkling its nose – something that is sure to speed up the ageing process."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2de44f81e21f27115778b5abdb35d97633f1ea0/345_263_3378_2028/master/3378.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=8ed5319ef1aa16516dd9dfa39e971379","title":"israel tells uk and eu to drop absurd backing for iran nuclear deal netanyahu","story":"Netanyahu puts Dominic Raab under pressure over UK refusal to abandon nuclear agreementThe Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has urged Britain and other EU states to end what he described as their “outrageous and absurd” support for the Iran nuclear deal.In talks in Jerusalem with Netanyahu and the Israeli foreign minister, Gabi Ashkenazi, the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, found himself under pressure over Britain’s decision to oppose the planned US “snapback”, or reinstatement, of all sanctions on Iran.The US, with the support of Israel and the Gulf states, wants to ensure that a UN conventional arms embargo is not lifted in October as set out in the Iran nuclear deal signed in 2015.In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the\u0026nbspJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspended a 12-year deadlock\u0026nbspover Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with\u0026nbspIran\u0026nbspwere in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.The recent agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates to normalise relations was in part driven by a joint animus towards Iran, but the UK has refused to abandon the nuclear agreement partly in the hope that it can renegotiated and revived after the US elections in November.Raab also met the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, in Jerusalem on Monday night where the British were again tackled over their support for the Iran deal.The timing made for an awkward backdrop for the two-day visit to Jerusalem by Raab, who has always prized close relations with the US, Israel and the United Arab Emirates.Raab welcomed the rapprochement between Israel and the UAE as an important moment, especially since it includes an agreement by Netanyahu to suspend plans to annex the West Bank, seen by the British as a threat to a negotiated two-state solution.The agreement has also been criticised for potentially making it harder to negotiate a comprehensive peace settlement since Israel will feel under even less exterior pressure to negotiate with the Palestinians.Raab later travelled to Ramallah where he will meet the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas.Raab said: “Israel’s suspension of annexation is an essential step towards a more peaceful Middle East. It is important to build on this new dynamic, and ultimately only the government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority can negotiate the two-state solution required to secure lasting peace.”The Israeli foreign minister said that when it came to Iran some UN security council members were undermining world security.“The E3 must understand that genuine opposition to Iranian aggression and concern for the security of the region can not only be heard in statements but must also be seen in action,” he said.Ashkenazi pointed out that Iran’s response to the announced normalisation between the United Arab Emirates and Israel was to threaten the UAE with an attack.Netanyahu, who met Raab later, had described the EU decision as “absurd and outrageous”.The US last Thursday invoked “snapback sanctions”, which are meant to automatically extend the embargo without the support of the security council. The E3, Russia and China wrote letters to the UN secretariat saying the US does not have the right to do so, because it left the the Iran deal in 2018. Meanwhile, in Tehran, Rafael Grossi, the director general of the UN’s nuclear weapons inspectorate, the International Atomic Energy Agency, met Iranian officials to discuss improved access for his inspectors to Iran’s nuclear sites. The talks, separate to lifting to the UN conventional arms embargo, have centred on IAEA access to two Iranian nuclear sites that have been blocked for months. The talks appeared to have made progress."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67df8e8f514f86f8b62987288afacf48fcd9f6d4/0_372_4486_2692/master/4486.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ede223a368b9f5817deb3097364375ce","title":"xinjiang residents handcuffed to their homes in covid lockdown","story":"Measures in capital of semi-autonomous region include being made to take traditional medicine despite no new cases in over a week Residents in the capital of Xinjiang are being forced to take traditional Chinese medicine, being handcuffed to buildings and ordered to stay inside for weeks as part of a harsh range of measures to tackle coronavirus, according to posts online.Urumqi, the capital of the semi-autonomous region known for its draconian security measures, has been in a “wartime state” of lockdown for more than a month after a cluster of cases emerged in July, when the outbreak had been mostly contained elsewhere in China.Since Friday, internet users have flooded social media platforms with complaints about overly harsh measures and extended quarantine at home or in designated locations, even as cases have gone down. The city, which had documented more than 531 cases by mid-August, has not reported any new cases in eight consecutive days.Internet users complained they had been chained to buildings when they attempted to leave their homes. One said they had been kept in a quarantine centre for two months and had been required to take the medicine Lianhua Qingwen, an herbal remedy China has been promoting as a treatment for Covid-19. A relative of one family in Urumqi told the  their family had been given the medicine every day but was not forced to drink it.Videos posted online by internet users purported to show residents screaming from their apartment windows in frustration. The video could not be verified but a notice posted online from one residential compound warned that anyone who participated in the “roaring” activity on 23 August had committed an “illegal act”.“Residents should strengthen their sense of social responsibility to prevent them from being used by those with evil intentions and lead to wrong guidance of public opinion,” it said. Other posts said residents were warned that everything from social credit rating to their children’s school admissions could be affected.Officials in Xinjiang, which has come under scrutiny for the mass detention and surveillance of Muslim minorities such as Uighurs, are accustomed to managing information. Internet users also posted notices from their residential compounds ordering all residents to stop using or to delete their Weibo accounts due to the “release of bad information”. Hashtags related to Xinjiang and Urumqi appeared to be blocked over the weekend and some users claimed they were ordered to post positive messages about the city’s response to Covid.Still, images and posts have been uploaded to Douban, another forum, as well as Twitter. One user wrote on Weibo in a thread that was later deleted: “When things reach a certain point, the voice of the public cannot be suppressed. If it is blocked in one place, it will move to another. If blocked there, it will move again and new ways will be found. Collective memory cannot be erased.”Chinese state media on Monday attempted to paint a more positive picture, reporting that some residential compounds in the city had begun allowing people to leave their homes for “outdoor activities”. Local officials in Urumqi reportedly released their phone numbers in order to “hear residents’ anxiety and help solve their problems”.The state-run Global Times newspaper said that in contrast to cities such as Beijing or Shanghai, extreme measures were adopted in Urumqi as a result of the “social norms in Xinjiang, where people … enjoy hanging out outdoors and like to gather together”.“Unlike the clustered infections in Beijing, which adopted precise anti-epidemic measures by sealing off certain affected communities and the majority of residents could live normally, the same measures cannot fit Xinjiang,” said Zhang Yuexin of the Xinjiang anti-epidemic group, according to the Global Times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/719059be3af6d25c37dcc6d92e06b274454e1cf9/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=129ee5ac055c32ac849a73ebfc05571a","title":"covid 19 climbdowns the uk governments u turns and missteps","story":"Claims of ‘world-beating’ coronavirus response tarnished by long list of reversalsThe list of U-turns carried out by Boris Johnson’s government in its response to Covid-19 continues to grow. After apparent failures on the contact-tracing app and a change of heart on school opening dates and A-level results, face masks have become the latest issue in the spotlight. Here are of some of the government’s missteps so far:After hundreds of schools prepared to defy official Public Health England advice, which said it “does not recommend” face masks in schools, Boris Johnson made an 11th-hour U-turn on the issue days before classrooms were due to reopen. In lockdown areas with extra restrictions, wearing face coverings will become mandatory in school corridors where social distancing is difficult, and in other areas of England headteachers will have discretion over school policy. The move came after pressure from teachers around the country who urged their use, and following Scotland’s announcement that secondary school pupils should wear masks in communal areas.After months of pursuing a £10bn centralised contact-tracing model and hiring more than 18,000 tracers, the government appears to have conceded that a regional approach may be needed to respond to the pandemic. Local authorities had argued for months they had the expertise through their existing public health tracing teams, but it was only in August that the government decided to offer regional teams more support. The changes also mean the axing of 6,000 national call handlers by the end of August.The government was forced to abandon its coronavirus contact-tracing app, which it had been developing for three months and poured millions of pounds into, despite experts repeatedly warning that the app would not work. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, who previously said the app would be ready for nationwide rollout in mid-May after being trialled on the Isle of Wight, explained that the NHS would switch to a decentralised alternative designed by the US tech firms Apple and Google.Boris Johnson announced that the government would be providing food vouchers for some of England’s poorest families after a campaign launched by the footballer Marcus Rashford. It came just 24 hours after No 10 had rejected his plea for it to keep paying for the £15-a-week vouchers over the summer.The government’s goal was for all primary school children in England to be back in class for a month before the summer holiday. Earlier this month, however,  Williamson admitted that not all children would be able to return before the summer, with some having to wait until September.Johnson announced the government would allow shielding MPs to vote by proxy after an outcry over the treatment of parliamentarians with medical conditions. Those with disabilities said they felt they were being disenfranchised. The leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, firmly refused to endorse a proxy voting system and that MPs should instead be paired. Within days of Rees-Mogg’s comments, Johnson announced the change at prime minister’s questions.In the first major U-turn of his premiership, Johnson announced that overseas NHS staff and care workers would no longer have to pay a controversial visa surcharge. He had rejected calls to scrap it at PMQs the day before.A scheme granting indefinite leave to remain in the UK to relatives of foreign national NHS staff who die from Covid-19 was extended to low-paid workers after their exclusion attracted widespread criticism. The scheme, introduced in April, initially excluded cleaners, porters and social care workers.A fortnight after stressing that the evidence was weak on the benefits of face coverings, the government changed its advice to say they should be worn in enclosed spaces and on public transport. It later went further, with a new rule imposed on 15 June that anyone travelling on public transport in England must wear a face covering.The government stopped testing in the community on 12 March and retreated to testing principally in hospitals, according to a damning letter MPs sent to Johnson. The science and technology committee wrote in May that the consequences had been that care home residents and carers could not be tested “at a time when the spread of the virus was at its most rampant”. The government announced plans to rapidly scale up testing at the beginning of April, when  Hancock pledged 100,000 tests a day in England by the end of that month."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4339147.1598421816!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"people in irish cities can take 15 years to put house deposit together","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tReport says a key issue is high rents in the private sectorWould-be homeowners living in Irish cities can spend over 15 years trying to claw a deposit together, a new report addressing the affordability of housing supply has said.Taking rent and other household expenditure into account, it says, the average time required to save a down payment ranges from 1.7 years in Kilkenny to more than 15 in Galway City, Wicklow, Waterford City, Cork City and Dublin City.However, the analysis - Putting Affordability at the Heart of the Housing System – envisages a system in which paying rent could be turned to a house buyer’s advantage.“A key issue is high rents in the private sector, which make it difficult to save for a deposit,” it says.“Having demonstrated the capacity and commitment to making regular rental payments, consideration should be given to taking the rental history of applicants into account in the mortgage application process.”The report, published by the Irish Home Builders Association (IHBA), which produces about 85 per cent of annual output, is calling for a range of issues that might address the problems in supply and affordability.Among them are a State backed shared equity scheme for affordable units an extension of the Help to Buy scheme and the conversion and restoration of vacant properties through a retrofitting incentive. It also suggests various measures to reduce the cost of construction, reassess densities and streamline the planning system.When it comes to affordability, it says working couples living in 21 of 34 city and county council areas have sufficient income to purchase a home at the local median price. The main affordability crisis is in the city council areas, where incomes are insufficient.It also says that housebuilding levels remain substantially below what is needed. Initial projections for output in 2020 show it falling to about 17,000 units due to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.“This is despite recent estimates from the Central Bank of Ireland and the ESRI (Economic and Social Research Institute) stating that an average of 35,000 new dwellings will be required per annum until 2030 to keep pace with the projected population growth.”The report estimates the cost of building a home, before the pandemic, at between €330,300 for a two-bed townhouse in Dublin, to €371,311 for a three bed-semi-detached house in the Greater Dublin Area, and €463,100 for a two-bed apartment in Dublin.Perhaps unsurprisingly for the sector, it puts some emphasis on the cost of government policy to the delivery of stock.“The quality of new homes is much higher than in the past, reflecting new regulations and higher building standards, all of which have a cost,” it says.“Estimates suggest that policy imposed costs account for around 20 per cent of the total delivery cost of a new home, and have been a factor in rising construction costs in recent years.”Typical construction costs, it says, account for up to 55 per cent."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Loss equivalent to an ice sheet over landmass of Ireland to a depth of 300 metresDiesel and petrol consumption fell as transport restrictions took hold, report shows\u0026lsquoStaggering\u0026rsquo study indicates sea level rises could reach a metre by the end of the century"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4338851.1598427450!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gaa securers planning for 200 bedroom hotel on grounds of clonliffe college","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe GAA   secured planning permission for the  hotel  close to Croke Park in Dublin.The GAA has secured planning permission for a seven storey 200 bedroom hotel on the grounds of Clonliffe College located close to Croke Park in Dublin.Dublin City Council has granted planning permission for the proposal in spite of opposition from a number of local residents, a nursing home operator and The Mountjoy Square Society.

It was compiled by Dr Ellen Crushell (consultant paediatrician and Dean of Faculty of Paediatrics at the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland), Dr John Murphy (consultant neonatologist) and Jacqueline Lacy (programme manager of the national clinical programme for children). The report is expected to acknowledge that the opening of schools increases the risk of infection. However, it will say that this risk is “unavoidable”.“We know that we must strive to restore children’s lives to normal. The current restrictive strategy can’t continue much longer. It has the potential cause long-lasting harm,” notes a draft circulated among senior officials and clinicians.“Primary schoolchildren are most affected because they are unable to participate in self-directed learning,” the draft warns. “The critical period for attainment of literacy skills and specifically reading is up to eight years. Reading ability is the foundation for ongoing vocabulary development and for wider educational attainment. Delays in this development will have knock-on effects.”Children with additional learning needs andor special needs “are disproportionately affected by the school closures. They need the structure of ongoing access to their inidualised learning plans supported by the special needs assistants (SNA), teachers and special education needs team within their school,” it says.What about other countries?The experts also reviewed evidence of the effects on children in other countries as a guide to Irish children’s experiences. It says that studies in China found that almost a quarter of children reported “depressive symptoms one month after lockdown”, while a report from Italy and Spain shows that 86 per cent of parents reported adverse changes in their child’s emotional wellbeing. “More than 30 per cent of parents reported boredom, irritability, increased worrying, feelings of loneliness and restlessness in their children,” it says.In addition the report finds that there are “added concerns about child welfare due to rise in family distress, domestic violence, parental alcohol intake and excessive time being spent by children on the internet. Educational settings are a natural area of vigilance of child welfare.”The draft report says that while there is an increased risk of infection, the effects on children are milder than among adults.“The UK and other countries have similarly reported low Covid-19 infectivity and morbidity rates in children. The available data points to a lower child-to-adult transmission rate compared with adult-to-adult transmission rates.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4336912.1598194872!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how three irish exporters are facing the prospect of a hard brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMartin McVicar, co-founder and CEO CombiLift in the Monaghan factory. ‘We have controls in place.’ Photograph: Philip FitzpatrickExporters are turning their attention to the next looming challenge: the possibility of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union’s single market and customs union on January 1st without a trade deal.And while Covid-19 continues to dominate the news and adversely affect business, some companies are optimistic that they are prepared as best they can be for the consequences of a hard Brexit.Silverhill Foods of Emyvale in Co Monaghan has an annual turnover of more than €30 million with 70 per cent of the company’s weekly output of 80,000 ducks exported to 27 countries – 40 per cent of them to Chinese restaurants in the UK. The initial impact of Brexit was two price hikes of 10 per cent each, both caused by a fall in the sterling to euro exchange rate.But the impact on sales was virtually zero and a World Trade Organisation tariff of 7 per cent, which will apply to Silverhill goods entering the UK without a UKEU trade deal, doesn’t faze the company’s head of sales, Barry Cullen.“It’s not a major price difference,” he says. “We are a premium product. We are about twice as expensive as our competitors, so we’re not price sensitive.”Two years ago when the implications of Brexit were sinking in, the company leased temporary warehouse space near Manchester where 100 pallets, each holding 420 frozen ducks, could be stored, thus ensuring UK customers would continue to be supplied if ports became jammed. The warehouse option can be revived after January, if needs be.The Silverhill breed, which is half Aylesbury, half Peking, is popular in France, Germany, Scandinavia and the Far East so as regards exporting to the rest of the world, the company long ago abandoned the UK land bridge and exports now, via Dublin Port, to Cherbourg and Rotterdam.Silverhill duck has become a far-travelled delicacy. In Singapore, what is marketed as “London Fat Duck” began life as an egg in Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone. It was hatched in Slieve Bragan, Co Monaghan and reared for 42 days on farms in Monaghan and Tyrone before being processed in Emyvale – all by a workforce of about 250.Cullen believes their UK customers, who are overwhelmingly ethnic Chinese enterprises, are well used to importing from outside the EU and the prospect of WTO tariffs and regulations doesn’t worry them. “They’re all fine about it,” he says.Longer term, Cullen sees Irish-based businesses turning away from the UK.Then there’s the prospect of increasing Silverhill’s burgeoning trade with the Far East.“Indonesia,” he says excitedly, “the population’s 260 million and you think it’s a poor country but you take the top one per cent. . . you start thinking in terms of selling pallets of duck and end up thinking of container loads.”PortwestLike Silverhill, warehousing became a solution for another major exporter, Portwest, the €180 million turnover, outdoor leisure and work clothing company which is based in Westport, Co Mayo and employs 4,500 people worldwide.“Before Brexit we had one main distribution warehouse in the UK, with 250 staff, serving every country in the EU,” says Portwest managing director Harry Hughes. “After Theresa May announced that the UK were leaving the customs union, we decided to open a second distribution warehouse in Poland and were ready when the first deadline passed.”The Polish warehouse has 150 staff and serves all of Portwest’s EU customers. The UK warehouse, with 100 fewer staff, serves UK and Portwest’s non-EU customers – England’s loss was Poland’s gain.“We are now Brexit-proof from issues associated with customs and borders,” says Hughes. “No company will be exempt from the possible political or commercial fallout.”CombiLiftCombiLift is another Monaghan-based company with a global reach that has also had to react to the potential worst-case scenario in January.The company, a hugely successful maker of forklift trucks, has grown over 22 years into a €300 million turnover enterprise employing 650 people.Most of the staff work at an enormous assembly plant that is 11 acres under roof and sits on a 100 acre site at the edge of Monaghan town. Four production lines, now working two at a time in staggered shifts because of Covid-19 distancing restrictions, crank out customised forklifts trucks.Their multi-directional wheel and steering system gives them extra manoeuvrability, allowing them operate in very confined spaces. This allows CombiLift to market itself as a space saver, selling customers the notion that their existing warehouse has greater capacity, if storage aisles are reconfigured and made narrower, thereby allowing for more shelving.While the company’s two largest markets, accounting for half of output, are the UK and US, it also exports to more than 80 countries throughout Europe and the Americas, as well as to Asia, Africa and Australia.The company’s single most significant response to Brexit was to obtain from Revenue the status of Authorised Economic Operator (AEO), a process that took 10 months and culminated in the issuing of a prized AEO certificate in June 2019.What the status means in effect is that the CombiLift plant in Monaghan becomes a customs and excise frontline, rather than the frontline being at the port through which exports flow. On a day-to-day basis, this means the plant operates like a bonded warehouse so when finished products or spare parts reach a port, they pass through the green channel, without delay and unchecked.“You become a trusted partner with Revenue and as long as you do everything properly, there is no reason for them to check what you do.”That said, the plant can be subject to inspection at any time and the perimeter of the site is laser beam protected. CCTV is everywhere.CombiLift has an articulated truck or container leaving the Monaghan plant every hour of every day. The company also takes in 40 truck-loads of imported parts, the company’s manufacturing raw materials.Whatever way Brexit pans out in January, CombiLift will be able to deliver spare parts to UK customers overnight.So McVicar hasn’t given up on the UK.“Whatever happens in Brexit is not going to stop us investing there, for multiple reasons,” he says. “The UK clients are still going to need forklift trucks to move goods around. In fact, their demand for warehousing space is going to be at a higher premium because the minute a company comes out of that European block, they’ll want to want to make sure they’ve goods on their island.“UK companies are going to be stocking higher levels of components and food to deal with border scenarios and where our products come into value is, even though we make forklift trucks, we are actually in the business of selling warehouse space. We sell forklift trucks that save warehouse space and as the demand for warehousing increases, there’s more demand for our product.“So even post-Brexit, whether there’s no deal or there is a deal, we’re still going to invest in the UK.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Julien BehalPA WireMinister for Health Stephen Donnelly has said that the Oireachtas Golf Society event in Clifden had been “an absolute disgrace” and “a slap in the face” for the public.Mr Donnelly called on EU commissioner Phil Hogan to “listen to the Taoiseach and Tánaiste” and to consider resigning because of the controversy from the event.“What happened in Galway is an absolute disgrace. It is a slap in the face for every man woman and family who has made sacrifices in so many different ways.”Later on the same programme Green Party leader and Minister Transport, Climate Action and Communications Networks, Eamon Ryan said that Mr Hogan had clearly breached public health guidelines but that ultimately it was up to the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to adjudicate.The Government had lost confidence in Mr Hogan, he said. It was important that the Government’s views on the matter be expressed clearly.“No one wants to be in this position.”European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen had requested details from Mr Hogan of his movements in Ireland prior to his attendance at an Oireachtas Golf Society dinner which appeared to contravene Covid-19 guidelines.In a statement on Tuesday night, the leaders of the three Government parties said that “concerns remain” about Mr Hogan’s movements after arriving in Ireland last month and the manner in which he has explained them. Senior sources confirmed it remained the view of the Government that Mr Hogan should resign as commissioner, and it is understood that Dr von der Leyen is aware of this.Mr Ryan said Mr Hogan was accountable to Dr von der Leyen and not the Government and it was up to her to make a decision on his future. Social Democrats co-leader Róisín Shortall earlier said that statements from Mr Hogan about his movements around Ireland while he should have been in self-isolation had raised more questions and had not provided answers.The commissioner had lost the confidence of the public with his “cavalier” attitude, she told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland.Ms Shortall said she believed his position was untenable and he needed to do the right thing and step down.“The longer this goes on it is bringing the country into disrepute.”The controversies of the last week in relation to the breaches of guidelines that Mr Hogan had engaged in were a distraction from the Government’s response to Covid-19, she added.“It is unfair at the very least for the commissioner to continue this controversy.”Mr Hogan needed to provide full answers about his breach of public health guidelines.Ms Shortall said that the “drip feeding” of information meant that what information had been received to date was “incomplete and inconsistent.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4338833.1598388157!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"who attended the golf dinner and what has happened to them since","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“You are hounding everybody, so no comment and goodbye,” said guest Loman Dempsey when contacted. Illustration: iStockMore than 80 guests attended an Oireachtas Golf Society dinner in the Station House Hotel, Clifden, Co Galway, last Wednesday at a time when Government regulations strictly limited indoor gatherings. Here is who was at it:Mr Calleary resigned as minister in the fallout from the event. Mr Hogan is now under intense pressure over his position.Former Fianna Fáil TD and senator Donie Cassidy had a table as president of the golf society. The Westmeath politician had eight guests at his table, according to the seating plan – understood to be mainly members of his family. Mr Cassidy resigned as vice-president of Fianna Fáil following the controversy.The society’s 50th anniversary event paid tribute to the late Mark Killilea, a founding member of the group and former Fianna Fáil MEP. Several members of the Killilea family attended the dinner, and his son, Fianna Fáil councillor Donagh Killilea, gave a speech. Former Fianna Fáil minister and property developer Frank Fahey was also at this table.The table included Senator Paddy Burke and councillor Enda McGloin, who both lost the Fine Gael whip as a result of their attendance. Dr Michael Harty, former TD and chair of the Oireachtas health committee, was also at the table.Others included former Fine Gael senator Paul Coghlan, and John Flaherty, captain of the guard at Leinster House, who is responsible for health and safety in the Houses of the Oireachtas.Supreme Court judge Séamus Woulfe and Fianna Fáil Senator Paul Daly have both apologised for their attendance at the event.Mr Justice Woulfe, who is a former attorney general, is now facing a Supreme Court-ordered review by former chief justice Susan Denham into whether he should have attended the event.Daly, who attended the event with his partner, Bernie, was stripped of the party whip last week by Taoiseach Micheál Martin.Galway businessman and owner of the Station House Hotel John Sweeney and his wife, Treena, were listed as guests at the table, as was the ambassador of Morocco.Chief executive of the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland Brian Hayes was seated here, alongside former Fine Gael senator Imelda Henry.Hayes, who is a former Fine Gael junior minister and MEP, apologised for attending the event, but said it did not affect his ability to fulfil his role as head of the BPFI. According to the seating plan, he also had three unnamed guests at the table.Henry, who is no longer in politics and owns a consulting firm, apologised “unreservedly” for attending the event, adding that she attended in a personal capacity.Two Fianna Fáil Senators, Aidan Davitt and Niall Blaney, were among those seated at this table. Both have apologised for attending.Taoiseach Micheál Martin has removed the party whip from both Senators. Mr Davitt has served as a Senator since 2016, while Mr Blaney was elected to the Seanad in 2020.Guests at this table included Fine Gael Senator Jerry Buttimer, who resigned as Leas Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, over the affair. His husband, Conchobar Ó Laoghaire, was also listed as a guest. Buttimer has said it was an “unintended but serious lapse of judgment in attending the event”.Other guests were Senator John Cummins, twice mayor of Waterford and one of three Fine Gael Senators who had the party whip removed from them over the scandal, and Pat McCartan, a former Workers Party TD and now retired Circuit Court judge. Mr McCartan serves as vice-captain of the Oireachtas Golf Society.Also at the table was former Independent TD Paudge Connolly, now a Monaghan County Councillor. The  revealed he was playing golf in Spain nine days previous to the dinner. Spain is not on the Government’s green list of countries, meaning people arriving back from there must quarantine for 14 days. Mr Connolly has yet to respond to a request for comment.Former Fianna Fáil minister of state with responsibility for older people Áine Brady and her husband, Gerry, also a former Fianna Fáil TD for Kildare and a local auctioneer, headed up this table. Neither have responded to phone calls.Kildare was under tightened lockdown restrictions at the time of the golf dinner, which meant residents were restricted to travel within the county, except for work, vital family or medical reasons. Brady is chief executive of Third Age, an organisation that supports older people in Ireland.In a statement reported by the Leinster Leader, she said she was “disappointed that my actions may have distracted from the tremendous work that the organisation does, and I will redouble my efforts to ensure that these programmes will continue to deliver positive outcomes for older people and communities in Ireland.” She added: “I unreservedly apologise and deeply regret my attendance at last week’s event.”There were eight other, as yet unidentified, guests at the Brady table, according to the table plans.Among the guests listed was Loman Dempsey, a property consultant and brother of former Fianna Fáil government minister Noel Dempsey.“I have no comment to make about that. You are hounding everybody, so no comment and goodbye,” he said when asked about his attendance.Sean Dempsey, a former school principal who regularly canvassed for his brother Noel, was also listed as a guest.Martin Brett, deputy chairman of Kilkenny County Council, was also at this table, along with a friend, Gerry Crowley. Mr Brett has said attendees were being wrongly “pilloried” and anyone who resigned over the scandal should be reinstated.“There has been a serious level of witch hunt against everybody that was at the dinner … We didn’t breach any guidelines,” he said. Others listed at the table included Anne and Ciaran Dooley, who Mr Brett said, “worked in Brussels at one stage”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4338846.1598391186!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government believes phil hogan should resign as fresh claims emerge","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t EU commissioner Phil Hogan’s future is being considered by European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen. Photograph: CollinsThe Government has strongly suggested that Phil Hogan broke the State’s public health guidelines in recent weeks, but says that his future is a matter for European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who must now make a decision on the EU commissioner’s position.In a statement on Tuesday night, the leaders of the three Government parties said that “concerns remain” about Mr Hogan’s movements after arriving in Ireland last month and the manner in which he has explained them. Senior sources confirmed it remained the view of the Government that Mr Hogan should resign as commissioner, and it is understood that Dr von der Leyen is aware of this.However, Government Buildings sources acknowledge the matter of his future is a decision for the commission president, and it is understood that Taoiseach Micheál Martin has not spoken directly to Dr von der Leyen. Sources say, however, that there have been extensive contacts between officials.The Government statement, the latest development in a controversy that has transfixed domestic politics since last week, came after a dramatic day when Mr Hogan delivered a lengthy explanation of his attendance at the controversial Oireachtas golf dinner and a timeline of his movements in the period preceding the event.He again apologised for his attendance at the event, but insisted that he did not break any health guidelines – saying that a negative Covid test excused him from quarantining after arriving here from Belgium and exemptions for essential work meant he was permitted to break the local lockdown in Co Kildare. Mr Hogan said it was there “black and white” on the Citizens Information website that anyone who has had a negative result in a Covid-19 test was no longer required to self-isolate. But the Department of Health disputed this, saying that this did not apply to people arriving in the country, who were required to complete their period of quarantine despite a negative test.Questions raisedOther elements of Mr Hogan’s explanation have also been called into doubt. Mr Hogan dined in a public restaurant at the K Club on the night he flew into Ireland from Brussels last month, according to a woman who saw him in the restaurant.The Leinster woman, who did not want to be named, told The  that Mr Hogan dined with two other guests at the table behind her and her husband on the night of Friday, July 31st.“We were there for our wedding anniversary he was seated at the table behind us with two other gentlemen,” she said.The revelations undermine Mr Hogan’s claims on Tuesday that he flew into Ireland on July 31st and “self-isolated for the days up to the 5th of August”, when he tested negative for Covid-19 at a medical appointment in a Dublin hospital.A spokesman for Mr Hogan had no comment to make on the July 31st dinner.The woman who said she sat at the table next to his that night said that she was “totally surprised” that Mr Hogan was now claiming that he abided by public health rules.Another woman, Niamh Duffy, from Co Cork, said she stayed at the K Club during the first week of August and saw Mr Hogan using public areas of the resort when he should have been self-isolating.The  has also learned that Mr Hogan made a social visit to Co Roscommon on August 17th that was not disclosed in the itinerary of his movements published by the European Commission.It is understood Mr Hogan paid a social visit in the county on the day in which he travelled from Co Kilkenny to Co Galway via Co Kildare."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Researchers say man had no Covid-19 symptoms the second time, suggesting immune system kept virus somewhat in checkLocals and police search the debris after five-storey structure crumbles in MahadLuon Sovath, who has spent decades fighting for human rights, was the victim of a vicious smear campaign this summerFears that country teetering on edge of major outbreak supported by data on rise in daily casesWhite supremacist killed 51 worshippers at two New Zealand mosques in March 2019Health condition \u0026lsquovery worrying\u0026rsquo after drinking tea that allies believe was laced with poisonDecision to transfer Kremlin critic ill with suspected poisoning after day of lobbyingProtests over last two months most serious threat yet to prime minister\u0026rsquos administrationLack of foreign visitors has facilitated increase in poaching and loss of revenueReport by US intelligence agencies sheds light on actions \u0026ndash and inactions \u0026ndash that created global crisisTens of thousands evacuated as record-breaking rains hit country\u0026rsquos southwestCountry entering dangerous new phase of rising infections in small towns and villagesUS president \u0026lsquopatently wrong\u0026rsquo when telling Minnesota crowd New Zealand situation \u0026lsquoterrible\u0026rsquoPolling put back by four weeks as 49 Covid-19 cases recorded in AucklandStudent-led demonstrations gain momentum testing laws protecting royal familyCovid-19 outbreak spreads to more than 30 people and extends beyond capitalJacinda Ardern sounds warning as number of cases in locked-down Auckland rises to 17Hundreds of police had raided Apple Daily in move decried as assault on press freedom\u0026lsquoGoing hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,\u0026rsquo Jacinda Ardern saysReturn to nationwide restrictions announced by PM Jacinda Ardern in surprise press conferenceStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4335701.1598013937!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk time wasting makes deal unlikely says barnier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit negotiator Michel Barnier: “Frankly I am disappointed and I am worried.”  Photograph: Yves HermanPOOLAFP via Getty ImagesThe EU’s Brexit negotiator has warned that valuable time is being wasted in trade talks with the UK as he accused his British counterparts of failing to make progress on topics of key interest to Europe during the latest round of trade negotiations. Michel Barnier said he was disappointed, concerned and surprised by the lack of progress displayed in discussions that took place in Brussels this week, reiterating that at this stage an agreement between the two sides still looked unlikely and that there was a risk the two sides would fail to ratify a deal by the end of the year. “Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards,” Mr Barnier said at a press conference following the conclusion of the latest negotiations. “I simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time.” The failure to advance the discussions that began on Tuesday evening leaves only a narrow window in which to agree the text of a trade agreement, translate it into multiple European languages and obtain ratification before the post-Brexit transition period ends on December 31st. While both the UK and EU insist they want a deal, EU officials decried a lack of momentum on the British side in the wake of Thursday’s session, with one describing it as “puzzling”. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, acknowledged in a separate statement that there had been “little progress” during the week’s talks, but he also insisted that a deal remained possible even if it would not be easy to achieve.State aid and fisheriesThe EU wants the two sides to push towards a common understanding on the topics of state aid and fisheries, rather than leaving these highly sensitive topics until later in the talks, but British negotiators are seeking to advance to a legal text in other areas where the two sides are closer together.Lord Frost criticised the EU’s approach on Friday. “The EU is still insisting not only that we must accept continuity with EU state aid and fisheries policy, but also that this must be agreed before any further substantive work can be done in any other area of the negotiation, including on legal texts,” he said. “This makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress.”Mr Barnier complained that he was not seeing any willingness on the UK side to take on board the EU’s priorities, adding that the need for a “level playing field” that ensures fair competition in areas including state aid would not go away and was a non-negotiable precondition to any trade deal.“No international agreement was ever reached without the parties agreeing to common rules,” he said. The notion of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement without level playing field provisions and a balanced deal on fisheries was a “non-starter” for the EU, and the absence of progress in these areas was blocking everything, he warned.British negotiating officials said the talks were stalling due to the problematic issues of fishing and state aid, over which they accused the EU of seeking to maintain the status quo.“What is frustrating is that Barnier wants to see us continuing arrangements very like those we had as members of the EU. The principle of ‘Brexit means Brexit’ is a good one and should be applied across the board,” the official said.“The process block now is that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else. We’re obviously not going to do that, so we’re frozen.”Key concernsMr Barnier confirmed that the UK had presented a draft legal text for the trade deal during the round of talks, but he added that this had not addressed the EU’s key concerns, serving instead as a reminder of the UK’s existing positions.Lord Frost added that the UK was seeking a relationship that ensures Britain regains “sovereign control of our own laws, borders, and waters” and is similar to other agreements struck by the EU elsewhere. “When the EU accepts this reality in all areas of the negotiation, it will be much easier to make progress.” A dinner between Mr Barnier and Lord Frost was held on Thursday evening after negotiations concluded, which officials suggested was tense following the lack of progress. “It was a very nice dinner, we had courteous and friendly discussions but we didn’t hide the difficulties between us,” one inidual said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc faces proms backlash campaigners propel land hope glory","story":"Land of Hope and Glory has been propelled to the top of the charts by campaigners amid a growing backlash against the BBC\u0027s choice of music for the Last Night of the Proms.The corporation was accused of “panicking” about race after announcing that only orchestral versions of the rousing patriotic anthems would be performed at next month’s event.As Lord Hall, the BBC’s outgoing director-general, admitted they had considered ditching the songs because of their association with Britain\u0027s imperial history, almost 25,000 people signed a petition demanding they be saved.Laurence Fox, the outspoken actor, led calls for the licence fee to be scrapped while Alok Sharma, the business secretary, urged the BBC to show subtitles amid a mounting campaign for a living room sing-along.New versions of the songs will be performed at the Royal Albert Hall on Sept 12. The concert is taking place without a live audience and with fewer musicians because of coronavirus.The decision to buck tradition and reinvent the finale of the Proms season began when Finnish conductor Dalia Stasevska, who is conducting the Last Night, and David Pickard, the BBC Proms director, discussed changing the repertoire to reflect the international debates about racism. But the attempt to placate both camps by choosing arrangements that would not require a soloist prompted accusations that it had “scored an own goal.”Mr Fox called on his supporters to retaliate by buying Dame Vera Lynn’s version of Land of Hope and Glory in a bid to get it to the top of the UK charts.\u0027Would the BBC then have to play it? What a beautiful day that would be,” he wrote on Twitter.Within a few hours, the 1994 remastered track had reached No.1 in the UK iTunes chart.Meanwhile, a petition calling for traditional versions of Rule Britannia and Land of Hope and Glory to be included in the programme attracted more than 20,000 signatures.It accuses the BBC of the “worst kind of tokenism” and insists that the songs are a “vital element of our heritage” that “sustained us in moments of national peril.”  It describes the Last Night as a “much-cherished ritual,” arguing that the songs are sung with pride “but also with a degree of joshing humour and wry self-mockery that is characteristically British.”Mr Sharma said the BBC should ensure that viewers who do not find the words offensive are able to join in from their living rooms.“Personally I would like to see the lyrics sung and of course it is always possible to put lyrics up as subtitles on the screen so if people want to they can join in at home,” he told Times Radio.Trevor Phillips, the former chairman of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, said the BBC always panicked about race as there was no ethnic ersity at the top.“What you have is rooms full of white men panicking that someone is going to think they are racist,” he added.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc made right artistic decision change rule britannia prom","story":"The BBC’s choice to play Rule, Britannia! without words at the Last Night of the Proms was the correct “artistic” decision, its director-general has insisted, as the corporation placed the blame squarely on Covid-19 after days of chaos.Lord Hall, who is to be replaced in the role by Tim Davie in one week\u0027s time, said it was the right decision for this year, as the corporation appeared to backtrack with a statement promising the song would be back in full for 2021. The BBC Proms has already come under pressure to ban songs appearing to glorify Britain\u0027s imperial past, with classical music industry sources suggesting the Covid-19 measures were a convenient reason to make changes.The very public fall-out lays bare the chaos at the centre of BBC decision-making, as it faced complaints from those who believe Rule Britannia should be banned outright for its reference to slavery, and those furious at it caving to what they see as “woke” culture wars.The strength of feeling within television industry was made public last night as the executive producer of Songs of Praise said Britain should apologise for slavery rather than glorifying it.We should not sing in a gloating way that Britons will never be enslaved, when we were responsible for enslaving so many. We should have anthems which celebrate what is truly great about the UK, which we can all sing and this will help unite our country, said Catriona Lewis of production company Nine Lives Media, on Twitter. It is understood that the corporation has been considering how to deal with the song for some time, having faced petitions from musicians to remove it from the Last Night altogether.After “BBC sources” briefed a Sunday newspaper that this year’s conductor had her own concerns about the words, the corporation has this week confirmed it will be performed only as an instrumental version as part of a medley.It said the decision was made as a result of wider measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus, with no audience at the Royal Albert Hall to sing along, and no chorus.A spokesman refused to detail who was involved in discussions, saying only that it was a BBC decision in what music critic Norman Lebrecht described as a process of panic, a flurry of meetings and further illustration that no-one at the BBC takes personal responsibility.On Tuesday evening, the BBC issued a new statement insisting the decision was for one year only, with the full programme of songs to be reinstated for a live performance in 2021.“For the avoidance of any doubt, these songs will be sung next year,” said a spokesman.“We obviously share the disappointment of everyone that the Proms will have to be different but believe this is the best solution in the circumstances and look forward to their traditional return next year.”The BBC has faced questions over why only particular songs had been changed in the circumstances while others will be sung in line with recent tradition during the event on September 12.Lord Hall confirmed that the issue of dropping songs because of their association with Britain\u0027s imperial history had previously been discussed.In an interview with the BBC, he said it was a miracle that Proms director David Pickard had put together a fortnight of live performances amid the pandemic.Asked whether there had been a discussion about dropping songs specifically because of their history, he replied: The whole thing has been discussed by David and his colleagues, of course it has.The point is they\u0027ve come to the right conclusion, which is it\u0027s very, very hard in an Albert Hall that takes over 5,000 people to have the atmosphere of the Last Night of the Proms, where a whole audience normally sing along.It\u0027s quite hard creatively and artistically to make that work. I think they\u0027ve come to the right conclusion.Who knows what will happen next year. I suspect it will be back.The fact is we have come to the right conclusion, which is a creative and artistic conclusion, he said on BBC Radio 4\u0027s World At One programme.Tim Davie, the BBC’s incoming director-general, had apparently insisted that a solution be found to retain Land of Hope and Glory and Rule, Britannia! in some form after returning from holiday on Monday, sources told the Times.The BBC said there had been unjustified personal attacks on social media on Finnish conductor Dalia Stasevska, who will be at the helm of the Last Night this year.A “BBC source” had previously told the Sunday Times: Dalia is a big supporter of Black Lives Matter and thinks a ceremony without an audience is the perfect moment to bring change.Decisions about the Proms are made by the BBC, in consultation with all artists involved, the corporation said.Classical music insiders noted that the briefing appeared to have been used by the BBC to test public opinion before it announced an orchestral version of Rule, Britannia!, and later clarified it was for one year only.The corporation had previously been lobbied by those in the classical music world to change the Last Night line-up, regardless of coronavirus measures.Chi-chi Nwanoku, the founder of Chineke! orchestra, told the  she had recently emailed the Proms team urging them to drop Rule Britannia and lyrics that “are just so offensive”.Writing on the Slipped Disc classical music blog, one anonymous musician who played Rule Britannia last year said he and “most” of his orchestra colleagues now “feel uncomfortable” playing it, leaving the BBC with “little choice”.The BBC would not confirm whether incoming director-general Tim Davie was part of the decision-making process, or whether Director of Creative Diversity, June Sarpong, or her team had been consulted.The national anthem and Jerusalem will still be sung during the event, which will air on BBC Radio 3 and on BBC One and feature soprano Golda Schultz and the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall in London.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"picture special farewell boeing 747","story":"The 747 was imagined in the 1960s to meet a growing demand for air travel, with Pan Am asking Boeing to design a plane twice the size of the 707, the first jetliner.It was the first twin aisle airliner and able to sit up to 10 across in economy class.

The 747’s famous hump was the result of the need to have a hinged cargo door at the front of the aircraft a design was chosen that allowed the cockpit to be placed on a second level above the cabin. It was this bubble top that made the aircraft instantly recognisable. By launch in 1970, nearly 30 of the world’s airlines had secured orders. The First Lady of the United States Pat Nixon christened the first aircraft before its inaugural flight, on Pan Am’s New York-London route, on which it would become such a success.Though its appeal to carriers was a low operating cost per seat, many airlines, especially flag carriers, purchased the 747 due to its prestige. Though its appeal to carriers was a low operating cost per seat, many airlines, especially flag carriers, purchased the 747 due to its prestige. Through the 1980s, Boeing was taking scores of orders for the aircraft every year, and delivering as many as 70 to its customers.The 747 brought air travel to the masses but it also ushered in a new Golden Age of Flying, with additional space allowing for unprecedented comfort and luxury.Though more and more people were able to fly, it was still considered a special occasion, prompting travellers and families to dress up for flights. Aircraft serving the holiday markets of the Caribbean were said to have carnival atmospheres on board.As planned by Boeing, the 747 was long popular with cargo operators thanks to its unobstructed fuselage and vast capacity. It could take off with a payload of up to 970,000lbs.Boeing continued to update the aircraft, stretching and modernising it to make it more fuel efficient. There are five main variants, with different models within each category, including the latest, the 747-8. Nasa still has a 747 in service it used to transport spacecraft, while Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic does the same, launching its aircraft at altitude. The evolution of smaller, more fuel efficient aircraft that are easier to fill, such as Boeing’s own 787 Dreamliner, makes the 747 less attractive to airlines. Today, more cargo operators than passenger airlines fly the aircraft, while orders have all but dried up.

defined as spending four and half hours or more a day sitting down - with 17.8 per cent, followed by a 7.4 per cent increase in Germany, 3.9 per cent in Spain, and just 0.2 per cent in Italy.Rates increased by around eight per cent across Europe as a whole.Inactivity is one of the biggest drivers of life-threatening conditions such as Type-2 diabetes and cancer.Published in the journal BCM Public Health, the authors argue that governments would have more success in battling unhealthy lifestyles if they stressed the dangers of spending too much time sitting down separately from encouraging people to go to the gym.Previous research in 2016 has estimated that there were 230,000 deaths in Europe each year attributable to sitting time, approximately 4.4 per cent of all deaths.Meanwhile experts have calculated the figure for Britain to be 70,000 deaths a year, 12 per cent of the total.The new study showed gender to significantly influence levels of sedentary sedentary behaviour, with 52.2 per cent of men across Europe sitting for more than four-and-a-half hours per day compared to 49.5 per cent of women. Between 2002 and 2017 the prevalence of sedentary behaviour in Great Britain increased by 25.2 per cent for men and 16.5 for women, while in Germany the prevalence increased by 15.6 per cent for men but decreased by 1.2 per cent for women.Overall, 43.5 per cent of British adults spent four and a half hours or more a day sitting down at the beginning of the study, whereas the proportion at the end was 53.3.Last year a survey of smartphone owners in the UK found that, on average, people spend three hours and 25 minutes on their phones each day, 52 minutes of which is spent on social media.Professor Xián Mayo Mauriz, who took part in the research at the King Juan Carlos University in Spain, said: We propose that the observed increase in the prevalence of physical inactivity could be attributed to people increasingly interacting with technology such as smartphones and streaming services during work and leisure time.“Our findings suggest that in addition to encouraging physical activity, governments should focus on reducing the amount of time people spend sitting per day.The authors caution that as the amount of time spent sitting was determined by participants describing a typical day, this study may underestimate the true prevalence of sedentary behaviour across Europe. Although the new data is for adults, the trends it reveals are likely also to apply to children.Reserachers have previously said that children’s time spent staring at the television, smartphones and tablets should be limited to 90 minutes a day to stop them from becoming obese.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/08/26/08/aaliyah.jpg","title":"aaliyah music streaming catalogue albums","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Fans marked 19 years since the artist\u0027s death on 25 AugustThe estate of the late singer Aaliyah has issued a statement announcing it is in discussions to try and bring her music catalogue to streaming sites.Fans around the world marked the 19th anniversary of the R\u0026ampB star’s death, aged 22, in a plane crash on 25 August 2001.

launch thousands of satellites as part of its Starlink\u0026nbspspace internet projectHundreds of astronomers have warned that satellite constellations like Elon Musk‘s Starlink network could prove “extremely impactful” to astronomy and scientific progress.A report by the Satellite Constellations 1 (Satcon1) workshop found that that constellations of bright satellites will fundamentally change ground-based optical and infrared astronomy and could impact the appearance of the night’s sky for stargazers around the world.The research brought together more than 250 astronomers, satellite operators and dark-sky advocates to better understand the astronomical impact of large satellite constellations.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“We find that the worst-case constellation designs prove extremely impactful to the most severely affected science programs,” stated the report, which was published on Tuesday.Elon Musk’s SpaceX plans to launch more than 30,000 Starlink satellites in order to beam high-speed internet down to Earth. The report warned that “Starlink alone may roughly double the number of space-based moving objects detectable by the unaided eye around twilight.”Options to reduce the impact include “darken them”, “keep them low”, “orient them to reflect less sunlight”, but number one on the list was “don’t launch them”.SpaceX has been frequently blamed for disrupting views of the night’s sky with its growing network of Starlink satellites, which currently number around 500. Early launches in 2019 triggered hundreds of UFO reports due to their unusual formation, with some astronomers comparing them to a “string of bright pearls”.The private space firm was criticised last month for blocking the view of the Comet Neowise as it made its once-every-6800-year journey past Earth.SpaceX launches and lands Mars-bound Starship craftSome timelapse images of the comet and other celestial objects appeared with long streaks caused by the low-orbit strings of Starlink satellites.The Starlink project aims to provide high-speed internet to under-served parts of the world, starting with remote areas of Canada before spreading coverage down to the equator as more satellites launch.SpaceX has deployed a variety of tactics to reduce the visibility of its satellite network, including painting them black and twisting the position of their solar panels to make them less reflective.The American Astronomical Society (AAS), which hosted Tuesday’s Satcon 1 event, worked with SpaceX to test and develop different methods to address the issue. SpaceX told The Independent that it also worked with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NROA) and the Green Bank Observatory (GBO) to minimise the impact of its satellites.Professor Tony Tyson from the University of California, Davis, said that one mitigation strategy discussed with SpaceX was making Starlink satellites 10-times darker to remove satellite trails.“However, even if that works, the satellite trails themselves will clearly be in the data – complicating data analysis and limiting discoveries,” he said.“With tens of thousands of low-Earth orbit satellites, we find that generally no combination of mitigations can completely avoid the impacts of satellite trails on the science programs of the coming generation of optical astronomy facilities.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This guide should helpChristopher Nolan’s new film Tenet has finally being released in several countries after a month-long delay.The espionage thriller stars John David Washington as The Protagonist, a man who finds himself on a mission to save the world.This being a Nolan film, it’s nowhere near as simple as that – Tenet comes submerged in the world of time travel in the form of something never before seen on-screen: time inversion.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLose focus for one scene, and you might be left scrabbling to catch up. Fortunately, we’re on hand to fill you in on everything you might have missed, or clarify what you might not have understood.*Warning – major spoilers for Tenet below*The key thing to know about time travel in Tenet is that you are unable to jump to a specific point in time. If you want to travel back to 40 years ago, you have to live those 40 years in reverse.Tenet is Nolan’s most confusing film, but thrilling to get lost inIs Tenet a sequel to Inception? Farfetched theory explainedFrom Avatar 2 to Mulan: Every delayed film and their new release dateHow do you become inverted?In the film’s world, there are portals used to become inverted in time, which are known as “turnstiles” – these are created at some point in the future. After going through them, you can move backwards in time from the point you entered. From this point, once you enter another one, you shall move forward from the point in time you have travelled back to, meaning two versions of the same person will exist simultaneously. Iy is imperative you do not meet – to do so, The Portagonist is told, would cause “annihilation”. Protective gear is worn in an attempt to prevent this from happening.Tenet presents a number of these machines, with the majority of the action focusing on one vault in an art storage facility in Oslo, and another in a warehouse in Tallinn.The reason why objects – including guns and bullets – can move backwards in present time is because these things have manually had their entropy reversed at some point in the future (entropy measurement is a way of distinguishing the past from the future).It is suggested that Russian oligarch Sator (Kenneth Branagh) and his men have done so after inverting themselves through the turnstiles. One theory is that, when these people fired their weapons at different points in time, the bullets would remain there until “caught” by the weapon that fired them.What is the Temporal Pincer Movement?At one stage in the film, this term is mentioned by Ives, a soldier played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson. It is a tactic used by people who move through the turnstiles to help you receive knowledge you learned in the future – it’s how Sator has been devising his plan the entire time. Once the information has been learnt, the idea is to then invert yourself (so you’re travelling backwards), so you can brief either past self or someone else. This, in turn, creates a loop of information.This occurs three times in the film – once when Sator threatens to shoot his wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki) if The Protagonist doesn’t tell him where the plutonium is hidden, and again during the battle sequence involving the “red” and “blue” team.The third time? For those who might have wandered here without watching the film first (which, again, we suggest you do), we’ll keep that a secret for now.It is worth remembering throughout: “Blue” + oxygen masks  inverted  “Red” and no oxygen masks  not inverted (if inverted and outside, you you can’t breathe regular air).Example one – the highway chase sequenceThe turnstile in Tallinn has two sections, which are separated by a glass pane – one side is “blue” and depicts an inverted Sator, the other is “red” and depicts The Protagonist in the present. This means that Sator in the preceding highway sequence had been moving back in time after going through the turnstile (we know this, because he is wearing an oxygen mask). A few scenes later, The Protagonist goes through the same turnstiles and returns to this scene – he is now inverted. In fact, we learn he was the one behind the wheel of the car driving the opposite way in the previous highway sequence, so his past self and future self almost collided.Example two – the “red” and “blue” team battle sequenceHere, the “blue” team invert themselves to go back in time so they can be filled in on the knowledge of what has already happened.To do this, they go back 10 minutes so they can then fill in the non-inverted “red” team on what will happen.

The forthcoming series is reportedly not a fictional adaptation of the popular Netflix show but rather is based on Joe Exotic, the second season of Wondery’s Over My Dead Body podcast.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe six-episode show, given the working title Joe Exotic, will follow the Saturday Night Live star as Baskin in her quest to rid the US of illegal big-cat zoos. Similar to Tiger King, it will chronicle how Baskin learns that Joseph ‘Joe Exotic’ Maldonado-Passage “is breeding and using his big cats for profit” and “sets out to shut down his venture, inciting a quickly escalating rivalry”. Baskin previously opened up to Entertainment Weekly about the casting choice, stating, “Kate McKinnon is a wonderful actress.”The McKinnon-led series is only one of the multiple projects in the works that are based on the surreal events surrounding Baskin and Maldonado-Passage.It was reported in May that Nicolas Cage will star as Maldonado-Passage in a separate eight-episode scripted series about the animal trader.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

Ever see 6 water spouts at once?” Mr Leday wrote on Facebook. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWater sprouts are tornadoes that form over water, or move from land to water,  according to the National Ocean Service.The watery vortexes have the same characteristics as a regular tornado, usually occur during storms and can be just as dangerous as regular tornadoes. Double hurricane threat as two tropical storms advance towards USMr Leday caught sight of the phenomenon as two tropical storms brewed off the coast of the US and hailstones in Louisiana.After a day as a hurricane, Storm Marco brought a surge of high water to the Louisiana coast on Monday, setting the stage for Tropical Storm Laura to enter the Gulf of Mexico and move towards the same stretch of US coast later in the week, most likely as a hurricane.People along the Gulf Coast braced for an onslaught from the twin storms, with many evacuees recalling the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when catastrophic flooding breached the levees in New Orleans and as many as 1,800 people died.“What we know is there’s going to be storm surge from Marco, we know that that water is not going to recede hardly at all before Laura hits, and so we’ve not seen this before and that’s why people need to be paying particular attention,” Governor John Bel Edwards warned at a Sunday briefing.Marco had grown into a hurricane early Sunday, and while its top winds dropped to 50 mph on Monday morning, the National Hurricane Center cautioned that Marco could still cause life-threatening storm surges and dangerous winds along the Gulf Coast. Marco was centred about 85 miles (135 kilometres) south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River Monday morning, moving northwest at 10 mph (17 kph).

Haiti’s prime minister said at least eight other people died and two were missing. In the Dominican Republic, relatives told reporters a collapsed wall killed a mother and her young son.Hundreds of thousands were without power in the Dominican Republic amid heavy flooding in both countries.Despite Marco’s weakening, a storm surge warning remained in place from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Ocean Springs, Mississippi. A tropical storm warning included Lake Pontchartrain in Louisiana and metropolitan New Orleans.A storm surge of up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) was forecast for parts of coastal Louisiana and Mississippi.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And for Mr Pompeo at least (who is travelling to Sudan, Bahrain, the UAE and Oman) it might offer an opportunity to encourage other countries in the region to follow suit.The UAE agreeing to have diplomatic relations with Israel is tentatively predicated on the notion that Israel suspends its controversial plan to unilaterally annex swathes of occupied Palestinian land, an action that is illegal under international law and seen by much of the international community as a huge obstacle to peace.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The U-turn came just  hours after No ruled out making them compulsory for pupils.The Department for Education said for most areas of England it is keeping its guidance against using face coverings - but schools will be able to make their own decision whether to ask pupils and staff to wear them.Pupils will have to wear masks in communal areas of schools such as hallways — but not classrooms.Furious Tories branded Education Secretary Mr Williamson’s department the “department of mess-ups”.The announcement is the fourth humiliating U-turn by the department in two months.No, teachers will not be obliged to wear face masks and PPE.The Prime Ministers official spokesman has revealed that teachers will not have to wear face coverings, unless providing care for a child who has come into school with symptoms.He said: Our guidance on face coverings is clear, they are for enclosed public spaces where you come into contact with people you dont normally meet such as crowded shops or public transport.It is rare for a teacher to have to wear PPE, they should only be wornproviding close-contact care for a child with symptoms.Jon Richards of Unison, representing support staff in schools, said masks were worn in other workplaces and it was vital that school staff should be allowed to wear them.Medical advisers also highlighted the risk of teachers spreading the virus to each other - rather than from pupil to pupil.Schools will provide hand sanitiser for staff and children to use when they reopen.Schools will have to ensure that sufficient hand-washing facilities are available, where a sink is not nearby, provide hand sanitiser in classrooms and other learning environments.Both teachers and pupils will have to frequently wash their hands with soap and water for  seconds and dry them thoroughly.Schools in Northern Ireland, that reopened on August , have bannedparents from coming past the gates.Public Health England has said that taking the temperature of pupils is an unreliable method for identying coronavirus.Wearing face coverings in corridors and communal areas of secondary schools is set to be introduced in Scotland.Kids would have to wear face masks while moving between classrooms.Nicola Sturgeon said she was acting in response to guidance from the World Health Organisation. Young people ed to Scotlands schools from August  with no requirements for physical distancing between younger pupils, and no rules around face coverings.There are many places to buy face masks for children as coverings are set to become the new normal in our everyday lives.You can buy masks for children via online outlets or from independent brands aiming to cash in on the rise in demand for face-masks.Some major companies such as Disney have created masks specically for children, inspired by iconic films such as The Little Mermaid, Toy Story and The Aristocats.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Usually there is at least a soloist,not a full choir leading the audience, but of course this year the public seats in the hall will be empty because of the virus, and the voices on stage silenced.Now, the lyrics of both songs are pro-colonial. If you ban them from the Last Night of the Proms, ending a tradition going back decades, what consequences will that have Certainly, someone  years from now will say we shouldn’t have done that.It is the same argument for not taking down statues. If you remove statues because that person stands for something evil in their past, you are removing the deed too.Manipulating history only adds to mistrust among the black community.I would like to see the survey that says the public want these two songs taken out of the Proms programme, because it appears to me that the public hasn’t been consulted.Rule, Britannia! was written by Scottish poet James Thomson and he features on the famous Scott Monument in Edinburgh, near where I live.He is also commemorated in Westminster Abbey’s Poets’ Corner, next to William Shakespeare.If we say we must remove his words from the Proms, do we then remove the memorials too Rule, Britannia!, written and set to music in , was mentioned in James Joyce’s novel, Ulysses. It is part of my history and my culture. If we take it away, we take away part of my culture.It’s a song about the power structure at the time, and the arrogance and hypocrisy of Britain vowing to “never be slaves” while at the same time owning and benefiting from about , black chattel slaves in the West Indies who were called ‘property’.Of course, people are sensitive to its meaning, as well as Land Of Hope And Glory, the music of which was written by Edward Elgar.It doesn’t mean we should hide it.I personally don’t find the lyrics offensive because they are a true representation of the terrible truth at the time.If you take that away, then you are replacing history with a fairy story.There is also the possibility that it was written to show the evil of the time, rather than glorying it.The objection is that Rule, Britannia! is used by flag-waving “prommers” as a jubilant finale at the Proms.It is used in the wrong context, and that is part of the ignorance of our society of our history.It’s the same with Amazing Grace, which was written by a slaver of black people and is sung as a religious anthem.Recently, it was proposed that we should ban Swing Low, Sweet Chariot at rugby matches due to its link to slavery. That came to nothing.Instead of banning such songs or stripping away their lyrics, we need to educate people on the history of slavery, starting with putting it on the history curriculum.From speaking to people about slavery, the one constant reaction is always: “Why didn’t anyone tell us this before ”At the Proms, instead of taking the words away, we should put an explanation in the programme. We should tell people it’s about enslaving black people, making money from them, giving them a short le span and then compensating the slave owners when it was abolished because slaves were regarded as ‘property’.If they want to sing it after reading that, then fine, go ahead and sing it. But I bet they won’t sing it as joyfully as they might have done before.When I worked in research, I once had a lovely technician who worked for me. She looked after me so well, and she went to the Proms.If she knew the history of those two songs, being my friend, I doubt she would have sung along.It wasn’t her fault that she didn’t know the history.Those songs didn’t have a place in the Proms in the first place, they are there because of people’s ignorance. I would challenge anyone to know their meanings and still sing them in a frivolous capacity.But we shouldn’t be bothering ourselves about whether those songs should now be removed.What we should be bothering ourselves about is increasing the representation of black people who are the descendants of slaves. We should be concerning ourselves about making sure black people from the Windrush generation get compensation. And we should also be ensuring ourselves that every child is taught the history of slavery so that they can make their own minds up about whether to sing songs like these.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The lunatics are in charge of the asylum #Defund the BBC.He previously wrote: I feel so honoured to be British and part of the incredible and erse modern nation we have become. Without the past, we wouldnt be where we are today. I wish the BBC would stop hating Britain so much #DefundTheBBC.His comments were echoed by Piers Morgan, who called the decision absolutely pathetic.Piers wrote on Twitter: The BBC needs to grow a pair  stop grovelling to such insane ‘woke’ cancel culture nonsense that most Britons find utterly absurd.Over , Brits have now called for the lyrics to be reinstated, signing a petition which hopes to reach , signatures.Former MEP Richard Tice was among those threatening to cancel his license fee, tweeting: If BBC wants to cancel our patriotism  our history by not singing Rule Britannia  Land of Hope  Glory, so I want to cancel my licence fee. They are in breach of their contract with the British people #DefundTheBBC.Lord Digby Jones added: So the BBC is considering dropping Rule Britannia  Land of Hope  Glory from the Last Night of the Proms. Is there no end to their wokeness  How about the enjoyment of the millions of Brits who pay the licence fee  You can’t choose history on your terms. It doesn’t belong to you.It came as a BBC source described the handling of the Proms line-up as “white guys in a panic,” trying to appease the Black Lives Matter movement.Meanwhile Boris Johnson slammed the “woke” plans to axe the patriotic sing-along climax from next month’s bash.Debating the issue on Good Morning Britain, freedom of speech campaigner Inaya Folarin Iman said criticism of the two songs was absurd, adding that they bring a lot of people joy and happiness.But Kehinde Andrews, a black studies professor at Birmingham City University, said the line Britons never, never, never shall be slaves from Rule Britannia is racist propaganda dating back to the British Empire.Organisers said they were concerned about the lyrics along with their links.TV choirmaster Gareth Malone, told The Times that he supported removing Rule Britannia lyrics in solidarity with black and Irish members of his choirs who had refused to sing it in previous years. He said: “If people want to sing about the subjugation and enslavement of other nations, I don’t think that should be given a  in .”His view was shared by Chi-Chi Nwanoku, founder of the Chineke! Foundation, which supports ethnic minority musicians. She told : “The lyrics are just so offensive.The annual Royal Albert Hall concert, beamed around the world, traditionally ends with the flag-waving anthems.At the weekend, it was reported that the conductor for this years Last Night, Dalia Stasevska of Finland, was keen to reduce the patriotic elements of the event.It led to a backlash yesterday, with the Prime Minister and Oliver Dowden, the Culture Secretary, getting involved.Mr Dowden told the BBC that “confident, forward-looking nations don’t erase their history”.And Boris Johnson said that while he understands the emotions involved, “we need to tackle the substance of problems, not the symbols”.Former Cabinet Minister Andrea Leadsom tweeted: “Seriously  Has the Beeb totally lost touch ”Tory MP David Morris said: “We cannot erase our history. We have got to be proud to be British. It does not matter what colour, creed or religion you are.”Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage told The Sun: “The BBC should stop apologising for our history and our heritage. People will be disgusted by this level of political correctness. The only thing that needs cancelling is the BBC itself.” And North West Durham MP Richard Holden wrote: “Another stupid move from the BBC. Just let the people sing! At every turn the BBC just dig the hole they’re in a bit deeper. They need to stop with this attempt to appease the woke morons.”In a bid to defuse the row, BBC bosses announced last night that the Last Night on September  would still feature familiar, patriotic elements.It said: With much reduced musical forces and no live audience, the Proms will curate a concert that includes familiar, patriotic elements such as Jerusalem and the National Anthem, and bring in new moments capturing the mood of this unique time [...].It added that the programme will include new orchestral versions of Pomp and Circumstance March No  Land of Hope and Gloryand Rule Britannia.There will be no audience at the Proms due to Covid restrictions. Mother of the FreeHow shall we extol theeWho are born of thee Wider still, and widerShall thy bounds be setGod, who made thee mightyMake thee mightier yet!Dear Land of Hope, thy hope is crownedGod make thee mightier yet!On Sovran brows, beloved, renownedOnce more thy crown is setThine equal laws, by Freedom gainedHave ruled thee well and longBy Freedom gained, by Truth maintainedThine Empire shall be strongThy fame is ancient as the daysAs Ocean large and wide: A pride that dares, and heeds not praiseA stern and silent prideNot that  joy that dreams contentWith what our sires have wonThe blood a hero sire hath spentStill nerves a hero sonBritons never, never, never shall be slaves.When Britain first, at heavens command,Arose from out the azure main,This was the charter of the land,AndAngels sang this strain:The nations not so blest as theeMust, in their turn, to tyrants fall,While thou shalt flourish great and free:The dread and envy of them all.Still more majestic shalt thou rise,More dreadful from each foreign stroke,As the loud blast that tears the skiesServes but to root thy native oak.Thee haughty tyrants neer shall tameAll their attempts to bend thee downWill but arouse thy generous flame,But work their woe and thy renown.To thee belongs the rural reignThy cities shall with commerce shineAll thine shall be the subject main,And every shore it circles, thine.The Muses, still with freedom found,Shall to thy happy coasts repair.Blest isle! with matchless beauty crowned,And manly hearts to guard the fair.Rule, Britannia!

At last, after an unprecedented lockdown of six months, all schools are due to re-open, representing a giant leap back towards normality. But the damage caused by the Coronavirus disruption has been severe.Many parents have been prevented from ing to work. Young people’s education has been badly undermined, especially because the quality of online learning has been so uneven. One study found that a fth of pupils had less than an hour’s instruction a day. Moreover, social activities and friendships – which are a vital part of growing up – have been heavily restricted.The exam chaos over the last fortnight was a fitting symbol of the vacuum created by the absence of proper schooling. No advanced society canwhen a vital sector like education is temporarily paralysed. That is why it is so important that the Government succeeds in its goal of seeing a fullto the classroom. As Boris Johnson put it at the weekend, “it is vital for pupils’ education. It is vital for their welfare. It’s vital for their physical and, indeed, mental well-being.”Given the Government’s mixed record on its management of the Covid crisis, this will be a big test. From the inadequate supply of protective gear to the botched imposition of quarantine rules, Ministers have got it badly wrong at times. They cannot afford another fiasco next week.But to do that, they will have to curtail the influence of militant teaching unions, which thrive in a climate of scare-mongering and grievance. Full of negativity, these hardened left-wing operators turn every pebble of dficulty into a giant boulder of obstruction. They are the abominable no men and women, the ultimate “can’t do” brigade.To overcome the unions’ capacity for trouble-making, reassurances about safety will be absolutely crucial. Most teachers are keen to go back to work, but they want to know schools will not be dangerous environments. That is why the recent upbeat advice from medical experts has been so welcome. It is clear from the Covid experience around the world that not only are children less likely to transmit the disease than any other group, but also that schools are safer than most other workplaces. Yesterday, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries pointed out that a child is more likely to be involved in a traffic accident or die from flu than to be harmed by Coronavirus.That message was also spelt out by her boss Chris Whitty, who said on Sunday that the damage to health caused by a continued schools lockdown is potentially greater than the impact of Covid. “The balance of risk is very strongly in favour of children going to school,” he declared, adding the chances of catching the disease “are incredibly small.” In fact, there is now hard evidence to prove this. Although the vast majority of schools were closed since March, over one million pupils – such as the children of essential workers – went back to the classroom in June. Yet a comprehensive study by Public Health England showed that in the subsequent weeks until the end of term, just  children and  staff tested positive for Covid- – and nearly all these infections occurred outside the school. There were hardly any cases of children passing on the disease to each other, or to their teachers. Other research from around the world has come to the same conclusion.But none of this seems to matter to the teaching unions, eager to exploit anxiety in pursuit of their anti-Tory agenda. These are the organisations which for decades have blocked every major reform of the education system and have defended every outdated working practice. With depressing inevitability, they have continually put their own narrow interests before the wider needs of pupils. They want the respect due to trained professionals but they frequently display the rebellious spirit of the permanent agitators. “Strike action is a very powerful tool,” said Amanda Martin, the President of the ,-strong National Education Unionin an interview with the Communist Morning Star newspaper in , adding, “I’ve run demos and rallies and worked with trade councils to bring everyone out and that’s brilliant.”Led by the NEU, the unions have brought the same attitude to the Coronavirus crisis. Instead of looking for solutions, they have endlessly exaggerated problems. One Whitehall insider says of Dr Mary Bousted, the £,-a-year joint general secretary of the NEU, “it’s all about the union, to hell with the teachers who want to get back into the classroom – let alone the children.” A left-wing radical, Bousted jokes that the word “strike” was one of the first she learnt as a child. Hers is not the voice of co-operation and enterprise, so it is hardly surprising that the Government has struggled to get schools reopened.In June, a planned majorwas thwarted by the unions, dealing a severe blow to Gavin Williamson’s credibility. One left-wing website gushed that the continued shutdown was due “to the hard work of NEU branch secretaries and rank and file militants galvanising the members.” In the months since, an alliance of unions – including Bousted’s NEU and Unite led by the notorious Merseyside militant Len McCluskey – have fought a y battle against a swt re-opening. Central to this effort at sabotage was a vast -point checklist of detailed questions which the Department for Education was told it had to answer. Dubbed by critics “a wreckers’ charter”, the list included queries such as “will lidded bins with double bagging be available in every classroom”, “will dedicated space be available for any breastfeeding women to express milk” and “has behaviour policy been reviewed to acknowledge the increased level of trauma and anxiety experienced by pupils ” Some Tories complained that the union was playing politics. Robert Halfon, the chairman of the Education Select Committee was amazed at the warped priorities: “It is incredible that not one of these nit-picking questions asks the most important thing of all – what’s best for the kids ”Even as September approaches, the whining and resistance has not ceased. “The unions need to stand firm and protect their members,” argues socialist teacher Martin Powell-Davies. In the latest ruse, the public sector outfit UNISON not only wants its members to wear masks in the classroom – something for which there is no scientic evidence of any need – but also to have extra funding for deep cleaning. “Schools need more money to pay for specially trained cleaners, rather than relying on other staff who are busy enough already,” says Jon Richards, UNISON’s head of education. The moan about over-stretched budgets is a favourite of the union movement but it is an empty accusation. The Government is pouring an extra £. billion into education, while this summer it was announced that teachers’ pay is to go up by an average of . per cent, a bigger increase than any other public sector workers received.But that did nothing to stop the combination of whingeing and shroud-waving. The mentality of the hardliners was embodied in a recent statement from the NEU’s far left “Education Solidarity Network” which set out a series of demands to “make sure safety comes first.” Among them were: “smaller class sizes to allow adequate physical distancing” arrangements “for rotas and home learning to be produced in consultation with parents” “local risk assessments to include staggered outdoor breaks, sanitising, provision of transparent coverings to enable access to lip reading and facial expression” and “weekly onsite testing of staff”. Above all, the Network called for extra funding “to implement these measures.” If there were any question of a risk to safety, the union should “prepare for a national strike ballot.”That was so typical. This lot seem to feel more comfortable on the picket line than in the classroom. The Solidary Network might be seen as extreme, but its carping outlook runs right through the unionYesterday, the NEU’s joint general secretary was bleating on the airwaves about the risks of new Covid spikes: “Staff, parents and pupils are being sorely let down by the government because of a lack of a Plan B and of ensuring robust track and trace is in place throughout the country. We believe the Government is negligent in the extreme.” The charge of negligence might be applied with more force to the NEU, whose hostile stance has made thesuch an exhausting obstacle course.

They believe that after death the soul remains in the house so the dead are treated to food, clothing, water, cigarettes.Bodies are kept wrapped in blankets in the room of the house or a ‘tongkonan’ - a traditional Torajan ancestral house with a distinctive boat-shaped roof so the rain water runs off.The fascinating snaps were captured by freelance photojournalist Hariandi Hafid show the Toraja tribe taking part in the “Manene” ritual - in which family members exhume and clean the bodies of the dead. Unlike in western cultures, where the body is swtly removed after death and frequently held a few days later, the tribe often keeps the bodies of their deceased loved ones in the family home for weeks,not months.During this time, the corpse will be spoken to in general conversation and a meal brought to the body three or four times a day.Once a funeral is held – after a suitable period of mourning and reflection – it is often a lavish affair costing exorbitant amounts of money and held over several days.The Toraja believe that death is just the next step in the soul’s journey through the universe. “My mother died suddenly, so we aren’t ready yet to let her go,” a Torajan woman, Yohana Palangda, told National Geographic in  of how this helps the grieving process.“I can’t accept burying her too quickly.”The ritual is performed during the harvest season around July, August and September and is typically performed every three or four years, depending on the familys wishes.During the procession, the traditional elderswill recite prayers in the ancient Toraja language.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the speed at which testing is being developed to enable faster swab results has led to hope costs could plummet and be accessible to more companies. Acting head of the Institute of Directors Edwin Morgan said: The big question is who pays for it.If larger companies want to do it voluntarily then great.

A cross party group of MPs has now demanded that the UK government steps ups and helps people suffering from the condition.It comes just days after researchers at North Bristol NHS Trust found that  out of  patients discharged from Southmead Hospital in Bristol were still experiencing symptoms when they were invited back to the clinic.Symptoms included breathlessness, muscle aches and excessive fatigue.The key symptoms of the virus include a new and persistent cough, a high temperature and a loss of taste and smell.But what are the sixteen symptoms of long Covid and what do you need to watch out for A survey recently revealed that one in four people who have overcome the virus have since experienced hair loss.An online survey was conducted of , people who have survived Covid.The results from the Survivor Corp Facebook group found that  per cent of people had experienced some form of hair loss.This could be hair loss of the scalp, or on other parts of the body such as the eyebrows.The condition know as telogen effluvium , is when a person temporarily experiences hair loss.Doctors have said that this usually occursa patient has recently experienced a stressful situation.TE occurs when the number of the follices in the scalp changes.It usually affects the top of the scalp and in most cases the hair line will not recedesomeone experiences TE.Severe cases of TE will spread to the eyebrows and other parts of the body.A high temperature is a key symptom of the coronavirus - anything over C is considered to be a high temperature.The NHS states thatyour temperature is that high then you wont need to take it and you will feel hot to touch on your chest or on your back.Your normal body temperature is approximately C.A fever is usually when your body temperature is .C or higher. You may feel warm, cold or shivery.In babies and children a normal temp is about .C, but this can y slightly from child to child.Back in June the US added diarrhoea to its official list of symptoms. This means you are experiencing uncontrollable bowel movements.Experts at Kings College London had previously identied this as a symptom.They placed patients into six categories of severity and people in categories three and six were found to have experienced diarrhoea.This symptom can be debilitating for many and is likely to stop people ing to work.In June it was reported that many Brits were suffering with post-virus fatigue.If you are suffering from exhaustion then you will have little or no energy - leaving you unable to do every day tasks.Its also likely that you will suffer from mental and physical exhaustion as a result and many patients who have overcome the coronavirus have battled this.Kings College London also listed exhaustion in three of its symptom clusters.Coronavirus is an infection that attacks the lungs so its no surprise that people who contract the virus are likely to suffer from chest pains.Some may have also been put on a ventilator which may cause pain later on.Even though this is not an official symptom - the World Health Organisation previously warned thatyou had the virus then your chest might be tight.Many people with long Covid had reported experiencing chest pains when climbing the stairs or walking.Insomnia is a condition which means you are unable to sleep for prolonged periods of time.The All-Party Parliamentary Grouppreviously heard that people with long Covid feel pressure toto work.Insomnia can leave you with exhaustion and many would struggle to work in these conditions.During March many people also reported that they were experiencing insomnia due to the stress caused by the pandemic.Patients who have overcome the virus have said they have experienced a hallucination.A hallucination is when someone sees, hears, smells, tastes or feels things that dont exist outside their mind.They can be frightening and are often caused by medications.A study previously found that there had been a rise in patients suffering from neurological conditions - with  per cent of patients having reported neurological issues. Covid toes is mainly seen in kids, doctors say. Medics treating Covid- patients have continuously reported seeing unusual cases where people have developed blisters and purple lesions on their feet.Doctors believe that the condition is inflammatory.The condition appears on the feet of patients, even when no other symptoms are apparent.Dr Ignacio Garcia-Doval explained that the most common type of rash in the study was maculopapules - small, flat and raised red bumps.However, experts were reluctant to say that the rashes are definitely linked to Covid- as they are a common symptom of many viral infections.The European Journal of Pediatric Dermatology said there had been a epidemic of cases in Italy involving children and young adults.It is a condition that had not previously been linked to the virus - but the APPGs have now added it to the list of symptoms that people with long Covid are suffering.Experiencing chills is another symptom that people with long Covid have experienced.Chills are the feeling you get when you start to feel cold despite there being no reason for this.Chills can occur with a fever and can make you shiver and shake.It can also feel like its impossible for you to get warm.Patients who are suffering with long Covid have reported feeling disorientated with their surroundings.Many patients have reported feeling delirium, confusion and anxiety.In particular, doctors say those with severe coronavirus who are admitted to hospital often develop an acute brain condition called “ICU delirium.Now many patients with long Covid have continued to suffer from these issues.   Cognitive issues include suffering from memory loss, struggling to pay attention and finding it hard to understand others.This can be debilitating for sufferers and many with the symptom have been unable toto work.Experts said that this may be caused by direct viral infection of the brain tissue.Associate Professor of Psychology, University of Michigan, Natalie C Tronson said: Growing evidence suggests additional indirect actions triggered via the virus’s infection of epithelial cells and the cardiovascular system, or through the immune system and inflammation, contribute to lasting neurological changes after Covid-.Most people who have the coronavirus are likely to experience breathing issues as it is a condition that attacks the lungs.But once patients have recovered many are still reporting this issue.Shortness of breath feels as though you are not getting the right amount of oxygen you need.It can feel like you are struggling to catch your breath.Most people will be used to experiencing muscle or body achesthey have had a long session at the gym.But people suffering from long Covid are often experiencing these issues and are unable to do simple things like get up out of a chair without struggling.Discomfort is a symptom of most viral infections as a foreign body has entered your system and your body responds to it accordingly.Inflammation caused by Covid can aggravate the muscles.Most people will usually experience a heart rate of over  beats a minutesthey have just exericised.A normal resting heart rate for adults can be anywhere between  and  and factors like weight can also contribute to this and typically people who weigh more have higher resting heart rates.Experts have previously said that athletes who recover from the virus may face dire or lasting heart complications.Having a high heart rate can make you feel as though you are out of breath.People who have recovered from the virus and are suffering from long Covid claim that they have experienced vomiting.In China, around only  per cent of coronavirus sufferers were being sick or had nausea - compared to more common symptoms like feveror dry cough .Yet, you can not rule out vomiting as a symptom, with former Page  model and actress Linda Lusardi claiming the virus made her sick, but in a dferent colour.Now people with long Covid have warned that this is an ongoing symptom.Having issues with your heart rate has also been reported by people with long-Covid.This means that it might feel as though your heart has skipped a beat as it is not in sync with its natural rhythm. The heart can beat too fast or too slow.It is usually the result of a weak or damaged heart.The Huffington Post reported that people with long-Covid have often managed to over come their symptoms, before coming down with them again.Some have also been forced to use a wheelchair and their symptoms get increasingly worse.In the UK over , people have died from the virus.While many who have overcome the virus have made full recoveries others are struggling toto a sense of normality.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The colour was described as apricot.What arrived — several weeks later — was a beyond-hideous sartorial aberration that was “Made in China” , out of a paper-thin polyester that would make me think twice about standing near a naked flame.What’s more, the colour was more camel and blue than “apricot”, it swamped me, and the brown belt in the photo was nowhere to be seen.It cost me  — approx £ — and the s policy is so ­unintelligible that it’s not worth the bother. More fool me.Buying a bookshelf or bog brush online is fine, but clothes is another matter.

It was am on a Monday morning and virtually empty.Little wonder when the ­government guidance says retailers must “discourage customers from handling products while browsing, and keep fitting rooms closed”.One store let me try on a dress then sanitised the cubicle afterwards, another told me thatI tried something on they would have to then take it off display for  hours.In LK Bennett, the fitting rooms were closed and I askedI could try on a blouse over my clothes, just to seeit actually fits. No, they said, you have to buy the item, take it home to try it on, then bring it backit doesn’t fit. Needless to say, I ed home empty-handed.So,our High Street clothes shops are to survive the pandemic, two things need to happen.Unless classed as vulnerable, those of us who actually enjoy clothes ­shopping need to get back out there as soon as possible and actively support them. And the Government needs to relax its strict rules and let retailers and shoppers take inidual responsibility for what happens in store.If I have to wear a mask and gloves to try on a pair of jeans in a cubicle, then I’m happy to do so.

They have risen to this unprecedented challenge and put their lives on the line to keep our country going. Now we need them to help lead the recovery from this crisis as we build back better. NHS and social workers, bus drivers, posties, delivery drivers, shop workers, and so many others have made sure we have all been cared for, fed and connected during this pandemic. They are ideally suited to rebuilding our communities and our country in the months and years ahead. The last few months have proven beyond all doubt that it is the unsung, underpaid and undervalued workers who are the backbones of our communities – the people that our economy and our country cannotwithout. They know what their communities need and truly know what it means to be a ‘public servant’. We want to ensure that our key workers are at the heart of decision-making across the country, which is why we are encouraging and supporting those who want to get involved in politics and stand for election in the years ahead. Politics is not arcane parliamentary language of Statutory Instruments or Select Committees. Politics is about what is happening on your high street, in your town, at your workplace. Politics is about making sure your children’s school has got the resources it needs or fighting back against dodgy landlords ripping off tenants. Real people and real lives. It is clear for all to see that our political institutions do not reflect the communities that they serve. I am proud that before I became a Member of Parliament I worked in our social care sector, going from house to house in my community supporting those who needed help. But when MPs talk in the House of Commons about the crisis facing our social care sector, how many of them have worked on the frontline and have first-hand experience of it  During debates on the Budget or the economy how many MPs have fed their families on a minimum wage pay packet  Not many, and certainly not nearly enough. This needs to change, and I am determined that the Labour Party, working with our trade unions and colleagues in local government, will lead that change.  I am proud that the Parliamentary Labour Party is the most erse it has ever been and is more than half of Labour MPs are women for the first time in our history. But we all know there is a huge amount of work to do, at all levels of government. We need to do more to ensure that our political institutions and elected representatives are rooted in our communities and better represent and reflect our communities, in all of their ersity. As deputy leader and party chair I am leading initiatives to encourage and support more female, black, Asian and minority ethnic, disabled and LGBTQ+ members to put themselves forward to stand as candidates and run for office.

In a letter to Mr Wallace, sent earlier this month, lawyers expressed “grave concerns” about the UK’s “failure” to repay the cash. “This failure continues to blight UK-Iranian relations and remains an intractable obstacle to Nazanin’s long-overdue release,” it said.  Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe’s legal team also suggested that concerns about US President Donald Trump ’s hardline stance on Iran was a factor in the UK’s actions.Requesting a meeting at the “earliest convenience”, the lawyers said: “There is still hope for an imminent positive ending for the Ratclfe family, but this requires you to stand by your words of  and take charge of the actions of International Military Services to find a way to honour the UK’s legal obligations to Iran“It also requires the UK Government to have the courage to stand up to Iran for its abusive treatment of Nazanin , and to protect their right toto England and be reunited with their families.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ofqual gave 49000 contract dominic","story":"NewsOfqual gave £, contract to Dominic Cummings allys firm ahead of A-levels fiascoEXCLUSIVE: Newly released documents reveal more cash was promised to Public First - taking the total value of government contracts handed to the firm this year above £ millionShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG News \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"What is really going on in politics  Get our daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The Mirror can today reveal the cost to the public for the first time, after the Government quietly published contracts on Sunday. Newly published details also confirm the deal was put in place without other firms being allowed to bid for the work. This latest revelation takes the total value of contracts handed to Public First this year over £ million.Public First is a small lobbying and research firm run by James Frayne, a Brexit ally of Mr Cummings, and Rachel Wolf, who co-wrote the  Tory manesto.The publication of the new contract was revealed by Tussell, a database of public contracts and spend.

When the existence of the Ofqual contract was first revealed in thelast week, the regulator said the usual tendering rules had been bypassed because of “exceptional circumstances”. Government contracts are usually awarded after a tender process which allows multiple providers to compete to provide the best value. But after the Covid- pandemic struck, new rules allowed contracts worth hundreds of thousands of pounds to be handed to firms directlythey were deemed “urgent”. A spokesperson said: “Due to the exceptional circumstances presented by the cancellation of exams, the single tender justication process was used for this contract, due to the need to urgently procure the work, in line with our procurement policy.”Public First founder James Frayne and Boris Johnson ’s top aide Dominic Cummings worked together at the Department for Education while Michael Gove was Education Secretary.Years earlier in , Mr Frayne and Mr Cummings founded an anti-EU think tank together, called the New Frontiers Foundation.

The scaffolding supervisor has terminal cancer after a potentially le-saving operation was cancelled because of Covid. Our hearts go out to Adrian and his family. What makes this all the more unbearable is it will not be an isolated case. Cancer Research fears a third of cancer patients have missed vital treatment because of the pandemic. The number of urgent cancer referrals by GPs in England fell by a half in May and there are more than two million people waiting for breast, bowel and cervical cancer screenings. We cannot allow the legacy of lockdown to be thousands of lives lost to other diseases. The same spirit of endeavour which saw the building of the Nightingale hospitals should now be applied to clearing this backlog and restoring all NHS services. Lives depend on it. Your turn Gav OFQUAL chief Sally Collier today put Gavin Williamson to shame by resigning over the exams fiasco. In a more honourable world it would be the Education Secretary who handed in his notice. Yet can again we are seeing civil servants being made scapegoats for failings by arrogant and incompetent Conservative ministers. Mr Williamson has been promoted way beyond his ability. Not only has he presided over the exam grading fiasco he has failed to set out a clear plan for schools to reopen. The confusion over whether pupils should wear face coverings has added to the chaos. At the same time figures show the gap between the richest and poorest pupils is rising. If Boris Johnson really cared about children’s schooling he would install a new Education Secretary capable of sorting out this mess. It’s Santatiser!

On Sunday, aposs piece detailing a customeraposs tip for getting the notoriously speedy checkout workers to slow down drew a huge response. She told the Aldi Mumaposs Facebook page how she realised you can ask them to slow down, I do, she said. They don’t mind. And never had a rude checkout operator either. But not all the responses were positive, as people disputed whether it was a good thing to ask a checkout worker to slow their pace, the M.E.N reports. Andrew Martin wrote: If people actually did what they’re suppose to do and put their shopping directly in their trolley then packed on the shelf provided you wouldn’t have an issue. Allan Milnes wrote: You are not supposed to pack your shopping at the tills in Aldi. Stick it back in your trolley and pack it at the tables at your own pace. Itaposs not a new concept I remember doing this in the aposs. Ive never packed a bag at the till unless its a few items. So many people have said it already, but you shouldnapost be asking them to slow down - just put it back in the trolley basket and pack it at the shelves opposite. Aldi and Lidl are cheap for a reason -you donapost like it donapost shop there, wrote Eden Cady-Mckellar.  Brenda Newall said: People should either pack it at the shelf after paying or do what I do sling it in the trolley and pack it at the car, thataposs the whole idea of aldi and lidl get through the checkout quicker I prefer it this way no dawdling about like other supermarkets. Aldi customers have said that keeping up with the lightning-fast supermarket checkout staff should be an aposOlympic sportapos.  Paying up a the end off your weekly shop becomes a personal challenge to try and bag the items as quickly as the cashier is scanning them. With a queue of keen spectators looking on, many shoppers crack under the pressure. Aldi customers have previously shared hilarious hacks to slow down the checkout staff, including one who advised scrunching up the packaging around the barcode so it wouldnapost scan first time. Others said they preferred to work in teams, with one slowly handing the items over one at a time at the till while the other packs. Not everyone was so outrage by the mumaposs Aldi tip. One said: I always ask the checkout workers at my local Aldi to slow down a bit, so I don’t get overwhelmed. They always say yes and it’s always very pleasant, never had a problem. But for others the sheer panic of racing to pack was all part of the Aldi experience. One argued: Keeping up with the ALDI checkout workers is a game for me. It should be an Olympic sport. A second added: Sometimes they go slow for me then other times it’s like a tornado and I can’t get the shopping fast enough into the trolley. When Aldi was asked why their cashiers scan items so quickly,were told staff members are encouraged to be as efficient as possible, which helps to keep the prices low. Bosses also claimed their checkouts are  per cent speedier than rivals - but said their checkout assistants were also trained to alter the rate they scan to match the pace of the shopper.

The leader of Ryedale District Council has condemned the extremely irresponsible people behind the party on Tara Park in North Yorkshire, that took place despite the current pandemic. It kept residents awake all night on Saturday, August , and Sunday, August , and could be heard in Malton and Norton, with  complaints made to police. One of the organisers of the party has since shared videos on social media showing a marquee set up on the site with a large sound system for the -year-oldaposs birthday. Videos show children dancing in the marquee at the start of the night before it thins out and there are just a handful of adults playing Acid Techno music until the sun comes up. Ryedale District Council says it is now working with partners, including North Yorkshire Police, who attended the site on Sunday and issued a dispersal order after those involved refused to follow  advice from officers. A team of council officers visited Tara Park yesterday to investigate what happened. They are also investigating reports of fly-tipping nearby. Yorkshire Live has approached the organiser of the party for a comment. Councillor Keane Duncan, leader of Ryedale District Council, said: This was, in effect, a rave involving  to  people near Tara Park. It was a -year-oldaposs birthday that has gotten out of control. We are talking about music blasting so loud it caused major disturbance to thousands of residents within a five mile radius of Malton. Many were left unable to sleep on Saturday night and it then started again on Sunday afternoon. Police had turned up and given advice but it was not followed. In the end, police had to issue a dispersal order after warnings were ignored. As a council we take this very seriously. Officers are working with police to ensure this doesn’t happen again and that those responsible are dealt with. As well as the noise, the team are also investigating some shocking flytipping nearby.

The proposal would free up millions of pounds to boost cyber warfare capability amid threats from Russia, China and Iran. One option being considered by the Ministry of Defence is to scrap plans to upgrade much of the fleet of Challenger  tanks and Warrior armoured fighting vehicles. A defence source told the Mirror “pressures on budgets across the department” led bosses to come up with the potential changes. The insider added: “But it would be a very big and bold decision, especially as the Warrior fighting vehicles have proved useful in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. No decision has been made as yet on the future of the Challenger and it is extremely unlikely it would be mothballed entirely. There is a chance some may be mothballed.” The MoD is under pressure to invest in cyber defence even though overall budgets are set to be slashed due to the economic downturn. Despite cuts, Britain is also committed to making a signicant contribution to NATO and helping defend Europe against the threat from Russia. The source added: “Having Challenger has been a huge plus in ensuring our partners know the UK is making a sizeable contribution to NATO.” The insider said the Army is “already very stretched”. If the Challenger tanks were mothballed they would be kept in storage and made available in an emergency.

Sharon Coupe, , from Edwinstowe near Sherwood Forest has always been house proud but felt like she stopped caring about her home after her diagnosis in May . The mother-of-two’s best friend was determined to help her with a DIY makeover and the two of them have spent lockdown making her home beautul again. Sharon, who has stage four bowel cancer and five tumours, said she believes there is no need to let things go just because of having cancer. She said: My house has always been beautul, but when I got diagnosed I just felt like I didn’t care what the house looked like anymore. If I was to die, nobody would say aposoh she had a lovely houseapos. But Cathie has dragged me out of my rut. We are now steadily going through the house and making it beautul again. In May , Sharon was rushed to Kings Mill Hospital in Nottinghamshire the same day as having her eyes tested after the optician saw something behind her eye that was illuminating. She was referred as an ‘urgent casualty’ before being told she would need to go to Hallamshire hospital in Sheffield. Two weeks later, the support worker was told she had a tumour behind her eye and needed to undergo a ciliary flap biopsy - she had the procedure on th August . One week later, doctors confirmed the cancerous tumour behind her right eye as secondary. Sharon, who is mother to Connor, , and Aaron, , then underwent a series of tests to find the primary cancer. Sharon said:I asked the doctors not to sugar coat anything for me. But my heart sank - I had silent tears rolling down my face and all I could think of was my boys Connor and Aaron. I bought them up alone as when Connor was five, his dad and I separated but I found out I was nine weeks pregnant with Aaron. My boys are my absolute rocks.  I provided a -hour urine sample, had numerous head, shoulder and full body scans before being sent to the Western Park hospital. I also had two liver biopsies and had to stay in hospital for five nights. The results delivered the devastating news that the primary cancer was in Sharon’s bowel - but it had also spread to her liver, lungs, right eye and bones - finding five tumours in total. She was told it is an extremely rare cancer which is inoperable and incurable but hopefully treatable. Her best friend Cathie and her mother were both by Sharon’s side as the results were given to her. Sharon added: Once the professor said the primary was in my lower bowel, I askedit could be removed but he said “that’s not all” as he explained the five tumours.  The professor said in his  years of experience - he had only seen three patients with this rare cancer - Sharon being his third. Sharon hasn’t been given a timeline but says she is now stage four. In July, she underwent an MRI scan and more PET scans. The last ones had shown treatment had been successful as  of the  tumours are stable. However the tumour behind her eye is not stable - and it has grown, with a cataract over it. She recently found out that the characteristics of the tumour had changed indicating it could have spread to her brain.  She said: As for the eye - I have now been told regardlessit’s gone into my brain I have to have the eye removed as the tumour is pushing on the retina. The cancer has also spread to my skull, collar bones, manubrium, my hips, my pelvis, my spine and three disks. The results of these new scans can show even more but we have to wait and see. The-mother-of-two felt like she stopped caring about her home after she was diagnosed - despite previously being described as ‘house proud’. But the best friends have now been completing a DIY home makeover. Sharon believes there is no need to let things go just because of cancer but said she has noticed DIY work taking a lot longer due to the fatigue that comes with the disease.  She said: There’s no need at all to let things go just because you have cancer… Yes it’s taking a lot longer to do as the fatigue that comes with this disease is something you cannot describe. But we are doing this and we are getting there! We are doing one room at a time but it takes a while as I do all the wallpaper, I am up and down the ladders, Cathie has been painting and I’ve glossed all the doors.Sharon experiences horrendous fatigue and extreme side effects from treatments including hot flushes, temperature, sweating, aching and headaches.She has also had pain in her hips and lower back throughout the DIY work.  Sharon has morphine inside her   and believes she wouldnapost be able to she didn’t have the constant pain relief. Sharon is on sandostatin LAR which is injected into her buttocks muscle every three weeks. She also has an injection in her stomach every eight weeks for her bone cancer but now suffers from extremely sensitive teeth. She added: I have Calci D mg a day, docusate and senna to help with the bowel, Creon  to help with my stomach and oxy norm every  hours for pain. I am on antidepressants too as the professor said as strong as I am and as much as I am smiling whenever they see me, he thinks this will take its toll.  He said it is a lot for any one person to put up with and I now have counselling too. However the pains and medication hasn’t stopped Sharon. The best friends have been working through the house transforming one room at a time. Sharon’s bedroom cost £ and is now complete with flamingo wallpaper and pink bedding and curtains. Her bedroom took three months to complete as Sharon struggled to do the wallpapering and go up and down ladders.  The friends then moved onto another bedroom which Sharon wanted to make grey, black and silver. This was done during lockdown and took five weeks. Sharon and Cathie worked on the bedroom with the help of her two sons and a family friend Les - the transformation cost £. She said: I think the room looks so classy now. All of these rooms have been done during lockdown. I can honestly say I am loving doing all of this. It may take its toll by the end of the day and it may take longer but when it’s done the feeling I get is of great joy knowing I’ve made an effort and not just stayed in bed feeling sorry for myself all day.  Sharon has also been keeping her friends and family updated via social media and said she has been overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people. She has had ’s of cards, flowers, gts and hampers and feels there are so many people that have gone out of their way and above and beyond to support her.The mother said she gets kind messages everyday from people asking hershe needs help and said she had no idea people on Facebook were so kind and caring.However Sharon recently experienced a breakdown and her two sons surprised her by taking her to the garden. Connor and Aaron surprised their mum by pulling all the weeds up, turfing the lawn and creating a decking area with a patio for her. Her friend Cathie also planted lots of flowers and even got Sharon a sunlounger to cheer her up. She said: Connor and Aaron came to my room after three weeks of breaking down and said aposright come on mum - let’s get you up.apos They took me to my dump of a back garden and when they said open your eyes - I was amazed! My garden was beautul and it really did help and prompted me to get up and sort myself out. Sadly money hasn’t been easy for Sharon as she only qualied for statutory sick pay - having not been in her job long enough.

Former PC Andy Ross was dismissed after a hearing found that he breached professional standards by wooing the woman. It was said that the Wiltshire Police officer even told her what to doanyone saw them together - such as pretending she had lost her dog. The inquiry heard that PC Ross contacted the woman - known as Ms X - last year after noticing her profile online, where she said she liked unorms. He sent a picture of himself in unorm to prove he was a police officer before using his personal mobile to arrange to meet her. PC Ross, , and Ms X then met at around pm on June  after he drove to her house in a marked car - at her request. He picked her up in the vehicle and parked up in an isolated location, where they chatted, kissed and hugged. The couple also talked about what Ms X would sayanyone spotted her with a police officer, it was said. PC Ross suggested she could say she’d lost her dog and he was helping her look for it. Seven weeks later, while on duty, the officer swapped a series of raunchy messages with the woman - including suggesting they could have sex in his police car. He then picked her up from home at .pm on August  while on duty in Chippenham, Wilts., and drove to an isolated location. They parked up for ten minutes, chatted, kissed and hugged. He dropped her off at home at around .pm. Again, they talked about what she would sayanyone asked. PC Ross suggested she say she had gone to the police station to make a witness statement and even fetched a witness information notice from the boot of his car to aid the lie. Barrister Alice Meredith, for Wiltshire Police, said the constable’s actions had brought discredit on the police service and would have undermined people’s confidence in the force. He was accused of neglecting his responsibilities as a police officer and breached a specic point in the force’s code of conduct stopping officers from engaging in sexual conduct or inappropriate behaviour while on duty. She said: The officer wished to meet with Ms X having been interacting with her on a dating website. Having expressed an interest in unorms and, prior to the second meeting, discussed engaging in sexual activity involving the use of a police car, Ms X and the officer made arrangements to meet whilst the officer was on unormed duty and using a marked police vehicle. The officer sent a photograph of a marked police vehicle he was driving, drove near her home in that vehicle and then collected her and met with her in that vehicle whilst on unormed duty.

A poll of , adults found  per cent would rather not find out the exact figure they owe, and  per cent don’t want to worry about something they feel they can’t do anything about. A further  per cent don’t even bother checking their account on payday, because seeing it all fly straight out to pay the bills and debt brings them down. It also emerged one in four are more likely to worry about their physical fitness than their financial form, despite six in  adults often thinking about or fretting about money. Maitham Mohsin, head of savings at Skipton Building Society, which commissioned the research, said: “We all deal with financial stress dferently. “Some of us will face it head on while others find it a challenging problem to face which can lead to some of us choosing to ignore the problem. “It’s interesting to see just how many people don’t know how much they owe or how much they have, hoping that the problem will resolve itself. “We understand things can be overwhelming but it’s important to start addressing our financial well-being as much as it is our physical and mental health where there has been such focus in recent months. If the problem is left alone it’s likely to get worse and impact on other aspects of le.” The study also found  per cent donapost check their bank balance on payday as they simply can’t be bothered to look. A further  per cent don’t check because they assume their employer won’t make a mistake, while one in  don’t even know how to access or get hold of their payslip in the first place.  And a tenth get disheartened by the amount of tax deducted from their gross salary. It also emerged more than one in  rarely check their account balance before making a purchase, but  per cent have had their card declined for not having enough left in their bank or building society. As many as  per cent have even been caught so off guard with their spending habits that they’ve been unable to afford an unexpected bill. However,  per cent wouldn’t dream of making a purchase without first checking how much they have squirreled away. The research, conducted via OnePoll, also found three-fths won’t bother to log their personal day-to-day spending. But of the  per cent who do watch their pounds and pennies, three in  use a banking app to keep track, while  per cent jot it down with a good, old fashioned pen and paper.  It also emerged nearly half of those polled hate talking about money and their finances, while  per cent don’t even like to think about it. And more than a quarter admitted to having a ‘bury their head in the sand’ attitude towards their cash situation. As a result,  per cent are worried about the current state of their finances, and three in  are even concerned for their financial future because they don’t feel they have everything in order.

According to a royal source the -year-old monarch will not reside at Buckingham Palace but would like to commute to the capitalit is safe to do so.It is believed that this will be the longest absence the Queen has had from Buckingham Palace during her -year reign, the Sunday Times reports.The Queen usually s to London in October after enjoying her annual summer break in Balmoral, but instead, she will reportedlyto Windsor Castle. Both the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have been self-isolating at Windsor since March  - four days before the UK went into lockdown. She has reportedly been told that the close-knit bubble of household staff who have been working with her in Windsor is the safest way to reduce the risk of her contracting coronavirus. A royal source said: There is a desire to get Buckingham Palace up and running again as a working palace, but onlyall the relevant advice suggests that it is appropriate to do so. It is believed that plans are being drawn up so the Queen can safely attend commemorations at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday in November.But until the threat of coronavirus is eliminated the Queen will not apparentlyto Buckingham Palace. However, it is thought that she will spend her Christmas break at Sandringham in Norfolk as usual. The news comes after reports that the coronavirus risk means the Queen may not be allowed toto her public duties for years to come.Royal biographer Andrew Morton, , told The Sun in May that he feared the Queen may only be seen on TV or video links rather than in public due to the risk to herself and Prince Philip.The writer, who penned Diana: Her True Story in , told the paper: Itaposs terribly sad but I canapost see how the Queen can resume her usual job. The Covid- virus isnapost going away soon and will be with us for months,not years.  It would be far too risky for the Queen to start meeting people on a regular basis. The stringent measures are expected to upset The Queen as she has said in the past that she has to be seen to be believed. Buckingham Palace is usually open to the public for  weeks each summer and selected dates during winter and spring.

As it approached the runway the aircraft was buffeted from left to right by the heavy winds, Coventry Live reported. While the plane drops closer to the ground it is dragged away from the centre of the landing strip by a serious gust. Thankfully the pilot had steady enough hands to land the plane. The aircraft was not the only thing to be disrupted by Storm Francisaposs winds, which are anticipated to hit mph tonight.

Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach to social distancing, there should be graded recommendations for dferent distancing rules in dferent settings, they argued. Writing in The BMJ, the team of researchers said this would provider greater protection for people in high risk settings and greater freedoms for people in lower risk settings. They added that this would potentially enable atowards normality in some aspects of social and economic le. Distancing rules should take account of multiple factors that affect risk, including type of activity, indoor versus outdoor settings, level of ventilation and whether face coverings are worn, they said. Other important factors include duration of exposure, susceptibility of an inidual to infection and viral load of the transmitter, they said. They wrote that some of the research which points towards two metres being the optimal safe distance was first published in .And research from the s is entrenched in the assumed scientic basis of the one to two metre rules to prevent coronavirus spread, despite limitations in accuracy of the early studies, they wrote.Newer studies have found that in certain circumstances, droplets from a forceful sneeze or cough could spread up to eight metres.  Meanwhile they argue that much of the research is based on droplet size without accounting for exhaled air. In reality transmission is much more complex, they wrote. Current rules on safe physical distancing are based on outdated science, according to Nicholas Jones,from Oxford Universityaposs Nuffield Department of Primary Care and colleagues. Distribution of viral particles is affected by numerous factors, including air flow. Evidence suggests Sars-CoV- may travel more than two metres through activities such as coughing and shouting. Rules on distancing should reflect the multiple factors that affect risk, including ventilation, occupancy, and exposure time.

Met Office yellow warnings for rain that cover Northern Ireland and parts of England, Wales and Scotland remain until am on Wednesday, and another for wind is in place until am. The Environment Agency still has  flood alerts and five flood warnings in place for England thanks to the grim conditions.Forecasters said the weather is expected to improve throughout the day but it will take a while longer for eastern areas to see the winds fully calm down as the storm moves off towards Europe.Temperatures today could even reach highs of C in the south as the showers and strong winds ease off. However, itaposs a temporary reprieve as August looks set to end in miserable fashion. Large parts of the country will be hit by more downpours on Thursday, and thunderstorms are forecast for Friday. The bank holiday weekend itself is currently predicted to be a mixed bag, with showers and winds in some parts of the UK and dry in others. Temperatures may struggle to get above C and will feel cooler, which is a far cry from the record breaking C heat Britain sweltered through in July.Met Office forecaster Craig Snell said: Francis has now pretty much moved off shore and itaposs now just a slow gradual improvement.The strongest gusts recorded on Tuesday was the mph wind that hit The Needles near the Isle of Wight at around pm. This is just short of the August record for the UK which was mph recorded in . Lake Vyrnwy in Powys, Wales, saw gusts of mph, equalling the Welsh August gust record of the mph recorded at Milford Haven in August . The wettest place on Tuesday was Bethesda in north Wales where mm of rain was recorded.  Meanwhile, the fire service in Northern Ireland said  people were rescued from flood water. Elderly residents had to be rescued from the County Down coastal resort town of Newcastle after a river burst its banks, and in Draperstown, Co Londonderry, rescuers had to save nine people from inside a house, along with four outside who were trying to help. A boat was used to help residents in Newcastle, a picturesque east coast town on the edge of the Mourne Mountains. Up to  homes have been affected and streets left under three or four feet of water, a local representative said. South Wales Police said they were involved in two separate water searches from the swollen River Taff and fire crews had to rescue holidaymakers from a flooded campsite in the town of St Clears, Carmarthenshire, after river levels rose in the area.  Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service said nine people and two dogs were rescued by fire service personnel using a swt rescue sledge, lines and wading gear. Crews also gave medical treatment to one man and evacuated  other people from a flooded caravan site in Wisemanaposs Bridge, Narberth, while  caravans were also removed from the site. RAC Breakdown spokesman Rod Dennis said that, until the middle of Wednesday, drivers need to brace themselves for some very unpleasant conditions on the roads. An amber weather warning covering a swathe of western Britain means there is a real risk of disruption to journeys from flying debris such as tree branches. Surface spray and perhaps some localised flooding are also possible, he said.

Marno Botha and his girlfriend Caitlynn Van Hecke thought it would be a laugh to change the colour of his facial hair from blond to black - with Marno saying he would just shave it offit went wrong. But the -year-oldaposs skin reacted to the dye, turning his face bright red and swollen everywhere he had applied the product, and it took weeks for the side-effects to subside. The areas on his chin, cheeks and upper lip became extremely sore and Marno had to take antihistamines for a month before his face began toto normal. Marno, from Vanderbijlpark, South Africa, said: We dyed my beard in the afternoon and I woke up at like am with this intense itching on my face so I decided to shave my beard. I noticed my face had extremely red marks where the hair dye had been applied to my beard and then it started to swell up. I could barely move my face and the itching got worse so I went to the doctor who said Iaposd had an allergic reaction to the hair dye.  Iaposd also suffered a chemical burn from leaving the hair dye on my face for too long. He had previously reacted badly to a henna dye but had completely forgotten about the experience when his partner Caitlynn suggested the new look at her home. He added: We just thought it would be fun and I could always shave the beard off - little did we know this would happen.

Glaciologist Konrad Steffen, , was working near the Swiss Camp research station he set up  years ago when the accident happened in poor visibility. He drowned in deep meltwater at the foot of the crevasse. Ryan Neely, a University of Leeds climate scientist who studied under Dr Steffen, said crevasses in the area “were unheard-of” until recently. He said: “It looks like climate change actually claimed him as a victim.”  When Steffen, from Switzerland, first arrived in Greenland in  to set up a weather station, rising sea levels were not a huge concern, although the scientic community had agreed climate change was under way.But this changed after Steffen proved that not only were the ice sheets melting, but they were also moving and breaking up into the sea. He has yet to be proved wrong. Known as “Koni”, he set up Swiss Camp on the western edge of the ice sheet and with a growing number of colleagues and students, would set out for weather stations every morning on a snowmobile, equipped with a satellite phone, an emergency sleeping bag, and a packet of Marlboros. He only slept four hours a night, and kept going by drinking espresso after espresso. Colleague Jason Box, a climate scientist, once said: “There has been speculation among us that he isn’t actually human. Some of his students believe he has espresso running through his veins.” Dr Neely remembered once waking up in his bunk, only to hear Dr Steffen ask: “How long do you think it would take for the entire Greenland ice sheet to melt ” He had been up for hours, making back-of-the envelope calculations.  He realised the melting ice was becoming a threat which world leaders should wake up to, and former US Vice President Al Gore and Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House of Representatives, were among the politicians who visited the camp in Greenland. In , Steffen flew over the Jakobshavn Glacier and saw that its tongue had collapsed, as though “somebody had hit it with a massive hammer”. Seismographs began to pick up an increasing number of ice quakes, suggesting the ice sheet was juddering towards the sea. The temperature was rising so steeply that at first Steffen did not believe his own monitors. After  years, they indicated a rise of C. Zurich-born Steffen believed the scientic community’s predictions of sea level rise were too optimistic. In , after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicted sea levels would rise by cm to cm by , Steffen said: “Unfortunately, I think we are looking more like a metre.” He told a journalist: “There will be a change coming, and obviously a change that we have not seen in thousands of years.” Because of the decline of sun-reflecting sea ice, the Arctic is thought to be warming twice as fast as the rest of the world.

The History of Dundee FC’ and ‘They Wore The Dark Blue’ books, told Tele Sport: “The season before they went to Dens Park,  , the club had gone for more high-profile players and had spent a lot of money on wages.“There were some controversial things happening, some disciplinary issues with players and then some directors not backing up other directors when it came to dealing with it.“To save money, they went with largely local lads the next season. I think the only top player they had was Sandy Keillor who was an outstanding player for a decade.“Dundee couldn’t pay off the debt, though, and were wound up. But the Scottish League stepped in, they wanted to keep a presence north of the Tay, and asked them not to pack in but to wait a while.“Essentially Dundee Football and Athletic Club liquidated and they played the last two games of the season with the new set-up under the name Dundee Football Club.“The club were fortunate that the lease for Carolina Port was changed for commercial use and the new like-minded committee moved to Dens Park.“There were now a group of like-minded people with the same drive and determination to grow the club. And the supporters responded.”Indeed, a packed Gilfillan Hall saw a new committee formed with the influential Bailie John Robertson appointed president.Soon, though, the club were without a home as their Carolina Port ground was being taken over by dock work.Gussie Park was considered before the committee settled on leasing some agricultural land alongside Provost Road and Dens Road.It was a steeply sloping bit of land but Robertson remarked the creation of the ground had been by “putting stout hearts to a stf brae” while the stand at Carolina Port was dismantled and rebuilt on the south side of the new pitch.The new era for Dundee Football Club started on August , , with , spectators and £-s-d – around £, today # taken at the gate.President Robertson kicked off for the visiting Edinburgh side St Bernard’s ahead of a - draw.Dundonian Fred McDiarmid made history by scoring Dundee’s first goal at Dens Park.Dens Park has been the scene of many happy memories for a great many people in its  year history.The ground has hosted a European Cup semi-final between the Dark Blues and AC Milan, a Fairs Cup semi-final with Leeds the visitors, three internationals between Scotland and Wales in ,  and  as well as two League Cup Finals in  and .Those were some of the great occasions but what does it mean to fans who have been heading through the turnstiles week after week, year after year Tele reader Malcolm Stewart has fond memories of watching Dave Curlett, Shug Reid, Jimmy Gabriel, Alan Cousin, Doug Cowie and many more in his early days at Dens.He said: “My first memory of going to Dens Park was when I was eight-years-old, so that would be . I went with my grandfather who had been supporting Dundee way before then.“My grandfather would take me to the Provie Road end but I was in the Main Stand for the big European games and that’s where I go now, too.  That stand has barely changed since!“I have a lot of memories about the  team, I was at Muirton for the league win. I think about half a million people say they were but I certainly was!“That team was outstanding and there was hardly ever any space anywhere in the stands in those days.“The TC Keay and Provie Road ends were open then of course, not the stands like they are now and there was an incredible atmosphere at Dens.“My favourite player was Charlie Cooke, he was something . He was later on after the European games and was only around for a couple of years but he was my favourite.“There have been plenty of good memories for me at Dens Park. Goodness knows what it will be like next season but I hope there are more to come.”The Main Stand at Dens, unique in its angled shape, will next year look back over a century of Dundee goals, moans and celebrations.Built in  by Archibald Leitch, whose other works include Old Trafford, Anfield, Goodison, Highbury, Hampden, Ibrox and Tynecastle among many more, the ‘bend’ in the middle was designed to ensure a great viewing angle whether watching from the middle or the ends of the stands.Just  years after almost being wound up, Dundee were making their presence in Scottish football felt.Price added: “The building of the stand in  was such an ambitious move. That showed from being almost liquidated  years previously and given a reprieve from the league to building one of the best stands in the country.”Thirty-two years later and the Main Stand, along with the other three sides were filled to the brim.A record , fans piled into the stadium to see a Scottish Cup second-round tie between the Dark Blues and Rangers.The Glasgow side would win - that day and go on to lt the cup as well as the ‘A’ Division title, as it was known then.The massive crowds wouldagain in the early s as the greatest Dundee team of all time celebrated their league success in  with a European adventure.Twenty-five thousand saw a Gilzean hat-trick as Bob Shankly’s Dark Blues thumped FC Cologne -, , saw another treble from Gilzean in a - victory over Sporting Lisbon and then just under , were there to see Alan Cousin and Gordon Smith see off Belgians Anderlecht in the quarter-final.Among those , was a young Norrie Price. He recalls: “I was there for what would be one of the top half-dozen attendances in what was only my second time at Dens at the age of .“Anderlecht with just short of , people at Dens Park was one of the greatest experiences of my le.“Anderlecht were a fabulous team as well, had just beaten Real Madrid. For the first  minutes it was just non-stop Anderlecht passing. Under the floodlights they had this white and mauve strip and played fabulous football. I was thinking ‘gosh, Dundee can’t get a hold of the ball!’“The experienced players helped and in the second half turned the game.“It was a fantastic atmosphere, electric. You could see puffs of smoke coming from supporters all over the ground whether the breath in the night air or cigarettes. There were lights all around the ground.“Big crowds have a le of their own and it absolutely hooked me forever.“First of all, just going to the game. It had been talked about for weeks. The newspapers were fantastic, had been talking about the game for ages and there were real souvenirs made.“Even now I have fabulous memories of all the build-up.”Gilzean would net nine times in that European run to the last four, stopped only by AC Milan, and scored a record  goals for Dundee.“Gilzean was my favourite,” added Price.“We used to pretend to be all the dferent players, Andy Penman, Alan Cousin, Alan Gilzean. Everyone wanted to be Gilzean because he scored the goals.“He had a tremendous burst of pace and would often be on the halfway line with teams trying to play offside.“It was a great team and the interchanging of passing was great to behold. You look at that era and there were so many heroes. Today the best teams have maybe three or four the kids like to pick out but it doesn’t happen so much now.“That night against Anderlecht it was Smith that made the dference, he transferred the ball from one foot to the other and wandered past the full-back and put it across for Penman. It was a goal out of nothing.”The Ibrox disaster of  saw regulations brought in and the days of huge crowds were over. Bench seats were installed which brought the capacity down from more than , to ,.Further improvements in fan safety saw that reduced even further during the s.Then , packed out the new-look Dens Park in December  as the eyes of the entire country were focused on the home of Dundee Football Club.For the second time in two years, the Scottish League Cup would be decided at Dens. This time the Dark Blues would be playing after rivals Dundee United had defeated Aberdeen in a replay of the - final the year before.The Tangerines were back to defend their trophy in what would be an all-Dundee affair, even referee Bob Valentine was local.Former Dark Blues inside forward Jim McLean, who turned out  times for the club, was in charge of United and leading them to their own glory days.Dundee were very much the underdogs, battling for promotion to the Premier Division, with United enjoying European football for the fourth-straight season.A first-half goal from Davie Dodds was added to by Paul Sturrock’s second-half brace as the Tangerines ran out - winners and lted the cup at the home of their rivals.Come the end of the campaign, it would be more cheerful for home fans at Dens Park with promotion secured at East Stirling thanks to an Eric Sinclair goal.Dundee historian Kenny Ross remembers that time as he began his love affair with the club.He said: “One of my early memories was in the run up to promotion in  .“I didn’t get to go to the League Cup Final in  at Dens, we couldn’t get tickets. My dad queued up but the shutters went up and we ended up watching it from the top of the Law with hundreds of others, from both sides, with the car radios on. It was packed up there. It was amazing.“Later that season, I remember going to a game against Berwick Rangers in March and being in the Stand Enclosure swinging my legs on the barriers! I think it finished - which tells you why I was doing that.“Myself and my dad then moved to the Provost Road end and watched games from the Bobby Cox until I started doing some of the media stuff for the club where I’m now at the back of the Main Stand.”He added: “There were , at that cup final. The last time the gates were shut were for a Skol Cup quarter-final, again against United, in  where , watched. The queues were horrendous that night before the gates closed.“The day Hearts lost the league at Dens in  was just under , and there were , in the ground when United won the league three years earlier.“The last time it was sold out was for the Championship win in  – that was a total sell-out against Dumbarton.”The next major changes came at the tail end of the th century with promotion to the top flight in  dependant on the redevelopment of Dens Park.Up came two near-identical stands at either end of the ground in record time, just  days, to meet the SPL’s required seating capacity.The Bob Shankly and Bobby Cox stands popped up and Dens Park as we recognise it today emerged into the new century.Along with the new millennium came glitz and glamour with the Bonetti revolution.Club stalwarts like Barry Smith and Gavin Rae were joined by Argentine great Caniggia and the likes of Georgi Nemsadze, Fabian Caballero and Juan Sara to boost the average home gate to ,.Fans would also see a Champions League winner in Fabrizio Ravanelli and English Premier League star Temuri Ketsbaia turn out in dark blue at Dens Park before administration hit.Supporters once more stepped in to help save the club in  through another administration, just like they did  years before.Fast forward seven years and owners Tim Keyes and John Nelms revealed plans for a new stadium to take Dundee from Dens Park to a new home at Camperdown Park.Initial hopes were that would be ready for the start of the   campaign but funding issues and a global pandemic have delayed the first spade in the ground at ‘New Campy’, the fans’ name for the potential new ground.Whenever that might arrive to replace Dens, fans will continue to flock to their club’s home of  years.However, the next home match, a League Cup clash with Forfar on October , will be a competitive match like no other at the old ground.Depending on government guidelines at the time when the new season starts, there could be no fans there for a competitive fixture. At the very least there will be social distancing measures in place to combat spread of coronavirus.The days of , at Dens Park may be gone but that won’t stop thousands still wanting to get their fix of football from the Main Stand, South Enclosure, Bobby Cox or Bob Shankly.“It’s almost a marker for your year, when the first game at Dens is,” Price added.“We were looking forward to the better weather and the play-offs earlier this year but they didn’t happen. Reality kicked in and everyone was aware how dangerous a situation it is for everyone now.“When you see football where kicking off, you do feel left out. This situation shows just how much we take for granted.”Andrew Nelson’s departure from Dundee this summer heralds the end of a chapter in the Dens Park club#s history\" title\"#Andrew Nelson’s departure from Dundee this summer heralds the end of a chapter in the Dens Park club#s history# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-fc-andrew-nelson-jim-mcintyre-james-mcpake embed # secretONRAQjKlL\" data-secret\"ONRAQjKlL\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

We also want to make sure the houses we are building are of a really high standard.“We are introducing a gold standard which is all about energy efficiency in the homes and creating community environments on the sites we are building on so people really have the benefit of living in energy-efficient, cost-effective homes moving forward.“That means the running costs for them will be low, but it also means the homes will be efficient and goes towards meeting our emissions targets.“The end result should be second-to-none and we will have real quality housing accommodation in the city which people will enjoy living in.“As local authorities, we should all be striving for that gold standard. Sometimes it can be dficult with the properties you have already – you can carry out adaptions within them, but it’s dficult to get them up to a higher level.“When you’ve got new-build opportunities, it’s vital to make sure they are greener and cheaper for the people who are going to be living there in the future.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

So many people are intimidated by other vehicles.

The village#s fire engine was used to demonstrate to the youngsters how dficult they are to see from the cab of a large goods vehicle, particularly to the rear and near side at junctions.They also learned about primary and secondary road positions, right of way and good observational skills.They were even encouraged to ask their parentsthey do the #Dutch Reach# to keep passing cyclists safe.

Instead of using the hand closest to the door, it means reaching across to open the door with the hand furthest from the door # your left handyou are the driver. This naturally turns your body towards the window, helping you spot approaching cyclists.Mr Catterwell added: #Thanks to Scottish Fire and Rescue Service for the use of the appliance and the drill yard, the Bike Bothy for administrative assistance and training materials and Graham Love for his excellent mechanical services. Also to residents and holiday makers around Craignish who were mostly respectful of the learner cyclists.#P S pupils Fergus Bennett, Beth Gregory, Magnus Hampton, Kay Neville, Harry Whittle and Reiley Van Der Zel received their Bikeability  badges.

The decision was taken to send me to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, and Neil Newman and Billy McArthur drove very carefully on the ersion route to Paisley, avoiding the recently damagedRest and be Thankful route.I am grateful to all those who delivered care to such a high standard, ensuring that my recovery was so successful after excellent treatment at the RAH.Jeremy Houston, PoltallochSir,As I read Councillor Alastair Redman’s letter in the August  edition of the Advertiser I thought how sad it is that a young man should always have such a pessimistic and depressing outlook that he chooses to share regularly with your readers.While we live through a pandemic we have seen the very best in people in our communities working to support and care for each other.Only last week the council publicly thanked the thousands of volunteers for their amazing efforts during the past months.The volunteers throughout our communities worked tirelessly and optimistically, always offering encouragement and kindness helping those who were at home to stay positive during such an anxious time.Local businesses provided an excellent service and continue to do so, enabling people to shop locally without making long journeys.If Councillor Redman cannot see the confident and positive support in all of our communities perhaps he should book an eye test, and he most certainly doesn’t have to travel to Barnard Castle to visit an optician.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertSir,I was delighted to see the piece in a recent issue of the Argyllshire Advertiser featuring a reader from Tayvallich, setting out his case for #Time for Change#. I share many of his concerns, and commend the series of articles.It would be good to hear from a range of Argyll and Bute residents with their ideas for how we get from #here# towards a better #there#. My personal pet project would be an Argyll and Bute Citizens’ Assembly, that would bring people together to generate real strategies to bring about just and #green# change for our area.A good start would be better transport links, via enhanced road and ferry services.A permanent solution to the Rest and be Thankful would be welcome, of course, but it was really heartening to see how Western Ferries rose to the challenge on Friday Auust .  They magicked away that endless queue at Gourock with great patience and goodwill and double service, showing what can be done.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,Following the latest landslide and road closure at the Rest and be Thankful, once again the road closure signs were placed at the wrong place on the Arrochar side.Having spoken to several of the local businesses owners, the main issue around the signs are they are too far away from the incident. There are information signs from Balloch to Tarbet advising of the closure at the Rest.Surely moving the signs to Ardgartan would make more sense. Should anyone have to turn then there is ample space to do this. We cannot continue to render two villages effectively closed in case someone has failed to read the signs or cannot turn.Transport Scotland and BEAR Scotland must guarantee that the signs will not be put back in the same place when further disruption occurs, and it will.Jane Ireland, Slanj restaurant, Tarbet"},{"url":null,"title":"news from the districts august 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMull of Kintyre music festivalhas taken its virtual  event to new heights by beaming a unique Scottish rendition of David Bowie’s #Space Oddity# to the International Space Station.The annual music festival teamed up with the Machrihanish Airbase Community Company , in the running to become the UK’s first spaceport, to record the unique set, featuring local band Slainte Davaar Allstar’s cover of Bowie’s iconic track.With the festival moved online this year the organisers came up with the idea of partnering with the local base and its unconventional location for the exclusive gig.The set was performed on the former top-secret RAF base runway # nearly two miles long and one of the longest in Europe – for current Commander of the ISS Chris Cassidy and Cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner, as they orbit the earth at ,mph.Event manager Iain Johnston of JIG Events said: #The Mull of Kintyre Music Festival has encouraged people to visit Kintyre from all parts of the globe since its inception  years ago and we were naturally disappointed, like every other event organiser up and down the country, to have to cancel this year.

Control system builders ITI will undertake the design, installation and commissioning of the upgrade across the station’s four units.The power station, constructed in a cavern within Ben Cruachan on the shores of Loch Awe, plays a critical role in stabilising the country’s electricity system throughout the Covid- pandemic due to its flexibility. The plant can generate power in less than a minute when needed and can also store excess electricity from the grid like a giant battery, a service which was called upon when the low electricity demand during the lockdown coincided with periods of high wind power in Scotland.The plant’s reversible turbines pump water from Loch Awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid. The stored water is then released back through the turbines to generate power quickly and reliably when demand increases."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGordon Stewart from Ardfern sent us thisatmospheric photograph, taken from Corranmor Farm on Monday August .A stunning full rainbow appeared that day over Loch Craignish lagoon, captured by Gordon on camera.PIC:no_aYourPictures_Rainbow"},{"url":null,"title":"enjoy cowal highland gathering in the comfort of your own home","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWith just days to go until one of Scotland’s favourite events takes the virtual stage for the first time, Cowal Highland Gathering’s organisers are preparing to unveil a packed programme to a worldwide audience.Cowal’s Virtual Highland Gathering is an ambitious three-day event which mirrors as closely as possible the programme of the gathering itself.Kicking off on Thursday August , Cowal’s Virtual Gathering features a host of exclusive interviews and performances, together with a look back at some of the highlights of the -year-old event.The Gathering’s Friday night gig is back too, with the Gig at the Gathering Unplugged going live from pm.

Itrsquos not so easy to access, but the fact the trees are now under threat made me want to discover the place before it might be too late. As I write, the decision has yet to be made on the fate of the trees.Irsquom a lover of history and totally understand the need to create a safe, weather-proof home for these historic planes, and to keep the museum as much an authentic visiting experience as possible. But there is a huge amount of space in the existing museum area, so the destruction of woodland seems unnecessary.The museum argues that any additional modern structures near the runway will undermine the historic look of the airfield. The proposed new visitor centre will, they say, create much-needed new jobs. So cutting down the trees to move the planes and create a new home for them is, the museum authorities argue, the only realistic option for them. They say that refusal of their plans will put the new jobs at risk.I totally understand the need for jobs at this time in particular, but the trouble is the approach taken by the museum is part of the reason the world is facing an ecological crisis with deforestation, the destruction of habitats and the extinction of wildle. It is part of the mindset that sees nature as ldquoin the way of development.Donrsquot be ridiculously dramatic, I hear some folks say this is not the Amazon or a rainforest in Indonesia, itrsquos a small wood in East Lothian.And that is precisely the point. It is a small but very rare example of a wood with mature trees in our county. It is a special place, with a ersity of trees and buzzing with wildle. Walk under its canopy and you will discover that. I know itrsquos proposed to plant new trees in a dferent area as compensation, but this wonrsquot connect to the wood and will take generations to grow. It will never replace what will be lost.If we seriously want to do something about the ecological disaster we are making on our planet then we need to start in our own backyard. We canrsquot campaign against deforestation, habitat destruction and declare a climate emergency, and then say: ldquoWell, the rules donrsquot apply to us when we want to destroy woodland to move some planes.Deforestation has a multitude of justications all over the world: dam building, road construction, cattle ranching, extreme poverty of subsistence farmers, profit from timber, oil exploration and pipelines, mining: the list is long. The point is there will always be someone with an economic justication for environmental destruction.While it may be on a much smaller scale, the proposal to destroy irreplaceable woodland in order to move some planes is a product of the same mindset that has brought us to a point of environmental and climate crisis.This mindset is revealed in the Historic Environment Scotland response to the proposal. This is the public body charged with protecting Scotlandrsquos built heritage. It has said: ldquoWe would not consider the trees of Sunnyside Strip to be directly related to the cultural signicance of the scheduled monument ndash they are visible but do not relate to our understanding of the monument as a wartime airfield.In other words, woodland isnrsquot part of our heritage mature trees, many of which were around before the war, arenrsquot historic or worthy of value in themselves. Really The wood is far more a historic part of the wartime airfield site than the massive car park. It seems to be a very selective viewpoint.The truth is that the UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries on the planet. A quarter of our already-decimated wild mammals are in danger of extinction. Our woodlands are small and dispersed, but all the more vital for the habitat they provide. East Lothian has huge developmental pressure, and this wood is a rare and vital part of naturersquos increasingly precarious foothold in our county.A changed mindset would be one which makes the protection of nature and the environment the initial default position. Developers should then take this priority as the starting point for proposals.That hasnrsquot happened with this plan, and credit to the council for rejecting it.There has been so much publicity and justied outrage recently over the destruction and littering of our land by people lsquowildrsquo camping and disrespecting nature. So many people, it seems, just donrsquot care, or seem unable to appreciate the gt of our natural environment and its importance.There is a disconnect from nature at the heart of this. We will never solve the environmental and climate crisis we are in until we can foster love and appreciation of nature, of which we are a part. Our childrenrsquos future literally depends on this.And institutions such as National Museums Scotland should be part of the solution, not the problem. Instead of viewing the woodland as irrelevant to the visitor experience, it could be used to enhance it. The wood is a magic place, with younger trees growing amidst towering old mature ones.My kids were in wonder as they explored the wood, peering up at the tops of the trees, and an old oak caught their attention as its boughs seemed to dip asto say hello. We spent a wonderful hour being immersed in nature.Many of our children, in fact many adults, have limited opportunities to explore and enjoy such places. Imagine the extra possibility of a nature walk in the tall wood, where wildle thrives and trees older than the airfield can tell their story. This wood is not an intrusion for the visitor but a potential wonderful addition. Get the ranger service to do talks and tours about this amazing place, a treasure hunt use it to enhance peoplersquos connection to nature ndash an extra experience.Woodland is not just a habitat for wildle, itrsquos a habitat for us humans too. Enjoying nature and learning about its importance should not be seen as a contradiction to enjoying historic planes.While Irsquom aware that itrsquos only part of the wood under threat, the proposal to destroy a large section of it will result in a tragic loss of trees and the habitat they provide. But itrsquos not just the destruction in itself, itrsquos also the precedent and example it sets for future developments.I really hope the Reporter will uphold the councilrsquos decision, and the museum, which is a fantastic and well-loved historic place to visit, will consider a new location for the visitor centre. Then we will all be winners."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-august-18-20-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoENOUGH is enoughrsquo was the message from traders in North Berwick, reported the East Lothian Courier on August , .The opening of North Berwickrsquos sixth charity shop this week has sparked controversy ndash and fears have been raised that a seventh could be on the cards.Traders claimed the resort had now reached ldquosaturation point with fundraising outlets, which are now selling new goods in addition to second-hand items.They said the charities were setting up shop on prime sites, and argued that they were ldquosubsidising them through having to pay higher rates.Fears that the trend could ultimately lead to a downturn in the local economy and the death of the High Street as a shopping centre were also expressed.The row follows the opening of the Chest, Heart  Stroke Associationrsquos outlet at a former delicatessen shop in the High Street on Monday.A RE-ENACTMENT of the Battle of Dunbar was postponed as it clashed with a model power boat demonstration, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of August , .The re-enactment of the Battle of Dunbar, which is to be staged by the Royal Scots as part of their recruiting drive in East Lothian, has been postponed for a week because it would have clashed with the running of a model power boat demonstration to be held on Sunday, September .

The local path was very busy the dog walkers, cyclists, families with children and joggers were enjoying the sun whilst social distancing.As always, I kept my eyes low on the water hoping to see the kingfisher.As we followed the river upstream to the area at The Grove, I spotted something moving in the water.I grabbed Chrisrsquo hand and I pulled him down on the ground right behind a bush.It was not a kingfisher but something I did not expect to see in the middle of the day... an otter fishing!We managed to crawl down the slope and lie down so we would not disturbit.Whilst I was photographing the otter, I also heard a cheery pee-pee-pee and saw the kingfisher flying past the otter. What a day!Since then I have seen the otter a couple more times.The Eurasian otter is a secretive, semi-aquatic species with chocolate brown fur, webbed feet, and a powerful tail. Their thick coats are built of two layers of fur: an inner layer that works as insulation, and the outer, waterproof layer. The two-layered system prevents their skin from direct contact with water and subsequent temperature loss.Their nostrils and ears stay closed as otters swim underwater.Despite being excellent swimmers, they cannot hold their breath underwater for long periods the average time underwater is about  seconds as they e.Otters are solitary, territorial animals, that live in underground holes called lsquoholtsrsquo. The size of their territory ies and depends on the quality of the habitat, amount of food and number of possible holts.It is also known that a male otter has a larger territory that can even overlap several female ottersrsquo territories. Otters usually have a well-defined area within their grounds in which they feed, rest and breed.Seeing signs of otters is generally easier than seeing the animals themselves. If you happen to find yourself at the riverbank or a sea loch, look for five-toed footprints and otter droppings , that are left in places such as fallen trees, rocks and weirs.Spraints are easily identiable as they contain visible fish bones and have a characteristic and not particularly unpleasant smell that has been described as ranging from fish to freshly brewed jasmine tea!The otter that you may see at the coast is very often called a lsquosea otterrsquo however, this is the same species as the animals that live further inland.If you would like to share how you get on finding the otters oryou have any rare kind of wildle in your area, I would love to hear from you.Speak to you next month!zanslensfacebook zanslens instagram zans_lens twitter zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"tantallon-castle-john-muir-birthplace-among-attractions-reopening","story":"Historic Environment Scotlandhas confirmed that Tantallon Castle, east of North Berwick, will accept visitors with pre-booked tickets from next Friday .A phased reopening of some HES sites across the county has begun, but there is no date yet for when Dirleton Castle could reopen.Both of these county attractions closed in March when lockdown was initiated to combat the coronavirus pandemic.A statement from HES said: ldquoAfter what has felt like historyrsquos longest wait, the easing of certain lockdown restrictions means you and your family can now grab a well-earned change of scenery at a selection of our safe and secure sites.ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to welcome you back and we would like to thank you for your patience and perseverance in staying home during this pandemic.ldquoWhen you arrive at any of our reopening sites, wersquoll need to work together to make sure we are all following the rules and staying protected.Entry tickets for Tantallon Castle can now be pre-booked via the website historicenviron ment.scotWalk-up visitors without an advanced booking will not be able to gain entry.Meanwhile, in another boost for the countyrsquos residents and visitors, the museum telling the story of Dunbarrsquos most famous son has reopened its doors.The John Muir Birthplace Museum welcomed back visitors on Tuesday for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak started.The museum, on the townrsquos High Street, allows visitors to explore the le and legacy of the man recognised as the father of the US national park system, in the house where he was born.Meanwhile, further attractions are also available for visitors to see at the National Museum of Flight, East Fortune.Hangar had already been open, along with the historic airfield and the parachute store.Now, the military aviation and civil aviation hangars have also opened to the public.Lucy Casot, CEO of Museums Galleries Scotland, said: ldquoWith so many of our museums and galleries across Scotland now able to open, therersquos so much to choose from, many with wonderful outdoor spaces to enjoy with the whole family.ldquoItrsquos not just a fun day out museums and galleries have a positive impact on our social wellbeing as well as the local economy, so we are urging everyone to make a point of visiting their favourite museum or gallery.ldquoAdditionally, with many of us staycationing this year, it is a wonderful opportunity to discover more of Scotlandrsquos inspiring museums and galleries."},{"url":null,"title":"retired-musselburgh-nurse-writes-book-caring-people-dementia","story":"Dee Jenkins, , of Eskmills Road, said the main aim of the publication ndash I Remember Dementia ndash was to encourage carers of dementia patients.Born in Dublin in , Mrs Jenkins, who has lived in Musselburgh for  years, came to Scotland in  to enter a religious order, the Novitiate for the Sisters of La Sagesse, at Leuchie House, North Berwick.

Signicant proposed changes include enabling the children involved to express their views and changing the way these views are obtained.But unless an amendment from Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur is agreed in tomorrows debate, a key opportunity will be missed to improve the chances that children will remain equally involved with both of their parents. The vast majority of research around the world concludes that equal time or close to it has enduring benefits for the children in separated families.Mr McArthurrsquos amendment introduces a factor into court hearings that has already been successful in other progressive countries. On the request of one of the parents, the sherf hearing a court case will have to consider whether children should spend approximately equal time with each of their parents.The amendment doesnrsquot force the court to order shared care. It doesnrsquot bind the hands of a sherf or undermine the overweening principle that the sherf will put the interests of the children first. It does mean thatthere are two safe, competent, loving parents both will have the opportunity to make their case for sharing the parenting responsibilities. It creates a dferent starting point for the decision from the winner-takes-all competition we currently have in Scotland.A similar law has been in force in Belgium since . It has reduced the number of such disputes that have to be brought to court. According to Belgian family judge Marie-France Carlier, ldquothere has been a huge reduction of parental conflict in the courts as parents now know what the law says. After separation, lots of them immediately decide to set up joint physical custody before having any court decision. A change in culture has gone hand in hand with a change in the law.Only about  per cent of Belgian decisions are for a : split with around % of remaining decisions for semi-equal care, with the children spending at least five days per fortnight with one parent.Usually it is the father who ends up with less time, but this still means he can be fully involved in weekday care ndash not relegated to the visiting role of a ldquoweekend dad. If the court considers that children will not benefit from full involvement of both parents it can order whatever contact pattern is best for them.Underpinning Mr McArthurrsquos amendment is an acceptance that the current system is expensive, unpredictable and inconsistent between courts and between sherfs. It has too many disincentives to cooperation between parents at a time when they need help to make things as easy as possible for their children, not a system that encourages them to criticise each other to win time with their kids.We have heard sherfs say from the bench ndash even before hearing arguments ndash that shared parenting never works. Of course sherfs also know they never see the successes. Only the failures come back before them.Politicians in countries such as Portugal, Greece and Brazil are currently considering whether to make similar changes in their family law. Holyrood could strike a blow for parental equality this week and bring the law into line with the reality of family le in modern Scotland.Ian Maxwell is the national manager of the Shared Parenting Scotland charity"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-fairer-ways-fund-councils","story":"Holyrood has the powers to determine local government structures and taxation.Effective local democracy needs effective and socially just fund-raising powers.Common Weal has suggested that Scotland should aim for local authorities to raise at least  per cent of their own revenue.No one method of local taxation is fair and, as Mr Maciver argues, local authorities could be empowered to decide on their own \"basket\" of taxes.Short-term steps could include widening the council tax bands and scrapping the cap on local authority council tax levels. A comprehensive revaluation should be set in hand which would give the basis both for a fairer property tax and for a land value tax, both to be introduced within five years. Local authorities should also be permitted a wider range of local taxes, which could include a tourist tax and workplace parking levies. Community councils should be enabled as of right to levy a small precept on the council tax instead of being dependent on local authority handouts. The balance of council income would come from the Scottish Government, which controls income tax levels, and would be at a iable level so that richer areas would receive less per head of population than poorer areas.This approach, primarily taxing land, property and income, would mean that Scotland could have a fairer and more progressive taxation system even within the constraints laid down by Westminster.David Mumford, Dunbar.NOT SO GREENYOU report on SSE Renewable`s new Viking wind farm near Shetland. As usual, there will be little use of Scottish labour and the turbines themselves will be installed and manufactured by a foreign company, in this case Vestas from Denmark Business, August . We are, as always, advised that some work will be offered to local labour but by far, the bulk of the turbine installation and manufacture goes to other countries.Wind turbines are always being promoted as green energy, but no thought has been given to the amount of fossil fuel used in their manufacture nor transport and installation. Another major cost, overlooked on all of their promotion, is the cost of decommissioning after the  to -year lespan and the subsequent disposable of currently unrecyclable turbine blades, the bulk being taken to landfill.George Dale, Beith.GAELIC FOLLYIT seems the force feeding of Gaelic continues apace.

The punctuation mark, it has been revealed, is seen as unnecessary and maybe even intimidating by younger people when it comes to social media conversations. Is this the end of the period Letrsquos get some context. How long has the full stop been around In its current form perhaps not as long as you think. The arrival of the printing press in the middle of the th century and the publication of Johannes Gutenbergrsquos Bible formalised punctuation in texts. Before that it had an up and down existence. In the third century BCE a librarian called Aristophanes introduced dots on the page as pauses. But this was of no interest to the ancient Romans who saw no need for spaces or punctuation in writing, mostly because writing was seen as something to be read aloud.It was early Christianity, which was devoted to the written word, that helped revive the idea of punctuation. In the seventh century Isidore of Seville introduced his own system of dots to indicate pauses, including the distintio finalis to indicate an end point.Monks played around with punctuation over the following centuries until printing set the punctuation marks we know today in ink, as it were.So, whatrsquos changed Social media. Text messaging is short and succinct. Itrsquos often only a few words long and punctuation isnrsquot really needed. Hitting send is now the equivalent of the full stop. As a result, for some younger users itrsquos now thought that when punctuation is used they find it odd.Is this more snowflake behaviour Have you been reading Jeremy Clarkson columns again  What in fact is happening is the evolution of written language in the face of new technological developments. When used in social media the full stop has acquired extra layers of meaning. As itrsquos not seen as necessary, its inclusion therefore implies means more than just an end to a sentence. Linguists suggest that to the social media generation, it can be seen as abrupt, negative, or even angry.The other interesting Twitter development is the use of the written words ldquoFull Stop to indicate that whatever precedes it settles an argument. In short, the humble periodhas become a tool in debate.Is anything taking the place of the full stop Online, the use of the exclamation mark is increasingly more common as a form of emphasis. And, of course, we are all using emojis now.So, how long before the full stop disappears Full stops in documents, letters, books or even in the very newspaper yoursquore currently reading, arenrsquot going anywhere soon.

Communism will render the state and its methods of suppression obsolete. People will learn to arrest themselves.Perhaps I was put in mind of that old Cheka-nut because, having ed from the bit of formerly Communist Yugoslavia that is now Croatia, Irsquove been required to arrest myself for a fortnight, not even being allowed out to pick up a pint of milk, and can expect the police to check up on my whereabouts at any hour of the day or night, under penalty of criminal sanctions.In the old days, arrest or police surveillance would have followed travel in the other direction. But itrsquos in the UK that these measures are in place, though Irsquom pretty certain Irsquove come back with nothing more subversive of the political weal or threatening to public health than mosquito bites and the pink tinge that passes for a tanyoursquore from the West of Scotland.For the most part, currentrestrictions on liberty donrsquot much dfer between most Western and Eastern European countries. Indeed, Croatia seems a kind of idyll, where people are behaving fairly normally, though they wear masks on the bus or in shops, and restaurants are especially diligent about wiping down the tables.But itrsquos doing much the same as Italy and Spain did, and the recent rise in the virus is similar to other Continental countries. Restrictions are still widely accepted, evengrumbling has got louder as time goes on, and the inconsistencies in the policies seem more obvious.I took my chances that quarantine might be reintroduced during my stay ndash as did those heading for Spain, or Portugal, or even France ndash and at least wersquore still allowed to question the effectiveness of the ious governmentsrsquo measures to contain coronavirus.Doing so in some other post-Communist regimes, however, seems to be hazardous to health, given the surprising number of doctors in Russia who have fallen out of windows after questioning the countryrsquos Covid strategies. Therersquos a similar intolerance of dissent in Belarus, which today marks the th anniversary of its independence. There, questions of social distancinghave been shunted to the side as hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets to oppose Alexander Lukashenkorsquos regime.Thatrsquos something you may think an odd response days after an electionit was won with  per cent of the electorate endorsing it, as Mr Lukashenko, in post since , maintains. It seems suspiciously of a piece with Mr Putinrsquos remarkable political longevity, and the unfortunate tendency of his opponents to end up in jail, go down with mysterious poison-related illnesses or fall out of windows.A look at the relative positions of countries that were once Communist suggests that there is quite a ide in the degree to which they now conform to western norms of liberalism, democracy, fair elections, freedom of the press and liberty of the average citizen. Croatia doesnrsquot now feel all that dferent from other Mediterranean holiday destinations ndash and thatrsquos despite the fact that, coincidentally, today also marks the th anniversary of the start of the Siege of Vuko, reminding us that it, and its FRY neighbours, were in a bitter war for much of the s.Things are not politically perfect in the region , but like most previously Communist countries west of Minsk, the Yugosphere nations now look like other European countries. Germany is entirely integrated: Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania are mainstream European, indeed EU, countries the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia have the dubious distinction of being as familiar to British partygoers on a stag night as Blackpool or Benidorm.They certainly deserve to be compared on most indices of economic and political freedom,not with the UK, France and Germany, with Greece, Italy and Portugal. Even worries about nationalism or corruption in, say, Hungary, are still more like similar concerns about Malta than Azerbaijan.Yet, with the exception of the Baltic states, always western-looking, shrugging off Communism in the early s has not automatically led to freedom for the countries that suffered under it, and the distinction is between post-Communist and post-Soviet nations.On the whole, the Communist countries of Europereacted to its fall by moving towards the democratic and economic principles of the West: capitalism, or at least social democracy that recognises property rights, the importance of free trade, and the rights and freedoms of the inidual.A few are still ldquotransitional or ldquohybrid regimes or, like Montenegro, have drted backwards, but none is like Belarus, Azerbaijan, Russia or the five ldquoStans to the south of it ndash all of which are ldquoconsolidated authoritarian regimes ie, dictatorships.This provides a pretty dramatic illustration of the lie that is so popular with those who still think Communism was a pretty good idea .It turns out that capitalism or neoliberalism or free markets or classical liberal principles do not thinly disguise oppression, but are principles that make their citizens more free and prosperous.

However, the new guidance will now include two additional situations where face coverings should be worn.ldquoFirstly, adults and pupils in secondary schools should wear face coverings when they are moving around school in areas where distancing is challenging ndash for example, through corridors or communal spaces. Secondly, adults and children aged five and over should wear face coverings on dedicated school transport and that, of course, simply mirrors the situation on public transport more generally.Ms Sturgeon stressed that dedicated school transport and crowded parts of schools have a ldquogreater potential for dferent groups to mix, there is ldquoles scope for distancing and effective ventilation and ldquotherersquos more chance of voices being raised resulting in the creation of aerosols.She added: ldquoWe believe that face coverings could provide an additional layer of protection in mitigating these factors.ldquoWe expect that most children and young people will have access to face coverings already, as part of their daily lives.

The poems lay undiscovered until a librarian pulled In the Cairngorms off the shelf, and some sheets of paper covered in handwriting fell out.ldquoAt first I thought they were notes from the person who had donated the book, but I looked closer and realised the paper was old and the ink was faded, said assistant librarian Toni Velikova.ldquoI was thrilled when I realised the handwriting matched Nan Shepherdrsquos signature and inscription in the book. One of the poems was written inside a Christmas card, which was also signed, and among the papers there was a letter written by Nan headed with the address in Aberdeen where shersquod lived all her le.ldquoI didnrsquot realise they were unpublished until I did some further research. It was so exciting ndash the sort of thing that happens only once in a librarianrsquos career.The poems were part of the correspondence between Shepherd and a Danish countess and artist, whom she met hillwalking.

It was very, very exciting. The Scottish Poetry Library is full of gems, but this was something truly exceptional.ldquoAt first, I was afraid that there might be a good reason they were unpublished, but I neednrsquot have worried ndash the four short poems are beautul.ldquoIt was thrilling to hold pieces of paper Nan Shepherd had written on and to read them aloud for the first time.Nan Shepherd was born in  and died in .

She had huge respect for the landscape of the Highlands and wrote about it in a non-colonial way that showed her deep relationship with these mountains.ldquoShepherdrsquos insightful, concentrated poetry of place, geology and ecology has more resonance in this strange year than it had even when it was written.

I believe that OLA representing the cattle industry in Orkney can have a strong association with Moredun in the future.#Beth Wells, from Moredun, said “Through meetings we have been fortunate to meet many of Orkney’s livestock farmers, who are well known for their high quality beef production and we are delighted to be developing a closer working collaboration with OLA, which will be of huge benefit to both of our organisations.”OLA is a sub-group of HiHealth Herdcare which is a national cattle health scheme. Karen Johnston, from OLA, said: “We are delighted and very honoured to give our members the opportunity to benefit from expert information and support from such a prestigious and well respected organisation.  We are looking forward to seeing how this partnership progresses and the benefits it brings to Orkney farmers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unlike student nurses and midwives, however, those training to be a paramedic are not eligible for a bursary, despite being unable to take up part time work.  To add insult to injury, their counterparts in England do receive bursaries.“This lack of a level playing field risks putting off those we need to see coming into our health service.  The current arrangements do little to encourage young people to pursue a career as a paramedic and store up problems for the future.“When I wrote to the Health Secretary recently on behalf of a constituent, I was told the government has no plans to review the funding options for trainee paramedics. Today, Nicola Sturgeon said she would look into the matter, having also been approached by a young constituent, angry at the unequal treatment.“The First Minister needs to recognise that introducing a bursary scheme would make a real dference, not least in widening access to the profession.  It’s time the Scottish Government properly recognised the dedication of our trainee paramedics by putting them on the same footing as trainee nurses and midwives.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On the Pentland Firth, people are still being forced to pay over the odds.“COVID has inevitably created challenges, but even prior to the pandemic there seemed to be little urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver on its promise. Assurances that Ministers will now ‘pick up the ball again’ are likely to ring hollow with islanders who just want a date for cheaper fares to be introduced.“Meantime, Ministers could help soften the blow from the delayed introduction of RET by using the underspend to cut fares on Orkney’s internal ferry services.

The rest were reduced by a single grade and she has missed out on As in English, Biology and Modern Studies, as well as a C in Higher Chemistry.Eva said to have her grades knocked down so signicantly has made her “completely reconsider her career path”.Exams were cancelled this year because of Covid- and replaced with estimated grades based on past attainment, and the school’s previous exam record.The modelling system adapted by the Scottish Qualications Authority reduced the grades of around , results, with analysis suggesting youngsters from poorer backgrounds and historically poorer performing schools suffered disproportionately.In her letter, shared almost , times on Twitter, Eva said that “it was clear” that her grades had been signicantly adjusted “because I go to a school classed as underperforming”.Her letter calls for the system, which she describes as discriminatory, to be urgently investigated, adding: “The government has been pushing the ‘no wrong path slogan’ but why should pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and deprived areas be forced into a pathway they didn’t want and worked tirelessly to avoid”.Eva had been predicted in her fourth year to achieve  As and two Cs at national five level, but in her exams she improved to come out with five As and a B.She added that her school’s recent performance had been affected by staff shortages.She had stayed behind after school for extra tuition, aiming to secure a university place and a career in the field of medicine.“Any further efforts by pupils to achieve higher grades in schools which have historically underperformed has been disregarded, she added.“SQA results this year have been more about fitting the statistical trends than the inidual pupil.”According to the Scottish Government#s own statistics, the estimated . per cent of most deprived pupils who would have expected an A-C band at Higher was lowered to . per cent by the SQA#s moderation system.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.jpg","title":"royal celtic societys unique music","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWork has begun on processing the twenty entries received for a unique competition which set the country’s musicians the challenge of creating a new shinty composition.

Kerry McWilliams, the founder of Lightwork NI, a charity that has provided more than  sessions of direct support to families over the past two months, said the crossover between school and family le was a major issue for many of the people she has worked with throughout the pandemic. Kerry said they have found that while children were largely able to keep in touch with the outside world and their peers through the likes of social media, many were uncomfortable being taught by their parents. And she said the stresses experienced by some groups of parents, such as key workers or those who had lost their income, made it more dficult for adults to support their children effectively. Home schooling was a cause of signicant conflict and distress, she said. Parents told us they found it very dficult to get children to do the work children told us they were afraid of being found out.One nine-year-old boy told me, #I don#t want to do school work with my parents because they think I#m really smart and they#re going to find out I#m not - I get good marks because I cheat and copy and when they see I can#t do the work they#re going to know#. This was a common fear for children - a sense of discomfort as school invaded their homes and family relationships. Most children like to keep school and home separate. Parents felt exposed and vulnerable as they were unable to understand or support their children#s learning.Many couldn#t access ICT equipment or provide internet access for multiple children and this led to frustration. She continued: We have lived through a global pandemic, a moment in history unprecedented in modern society. Families I have worked with have all moved through paralysing fear, powerlessness and panic. They have taken a fresh look at what makes them happy, what is worth fighting for - we all realised it#s not toilet roll - and how far they have sleepwalked into a le they wouldn#t have consciously chosen, and don#t really want to go back to. I believe the legacy and consequences of lockdown will be signicant for everyone both in the immediate future and for many years to come.She said there are a number of steps parents can take in the coming weeks and months to ensure their children cope with theto school, including drawing upon the relationships that were built during lockdown and ensuring children#s voices are heard. She also recommended putting in place routines and precautions to ensure everyone feels safe: Then you can stop worrying. Our worries communicate to children - when you feel confident and optimistic, they will too.

It#s been an incredibly rushed and quick turn around, but it#s not really until the children are back that we will see how it will work as that may well throw up other issues that we haven#t even thought of yet.Ms White added: However, one of the most fundamental things we need clarity on is what should be done straight awaya child or staff member tests positive for Covid-.

He will be described as a collector and slave owner on signage.The museum#s curators said the decision was influenced by the Black Lives Matter movement, sparked by the killing of George Floyd in the USA in May.Sir Hans was born in  and was a physician and natural scientist who married a wealthy heiress of Jamaican sugar plantations worked on by slaves. He was also credited with creating drinking chocolate.His collection of artefacts was the starting point of what became the British Museum.Shorty before his death in , he bequeathed many of his belongings to the nation, and , of them formed much of what would stock the British Museum.Speaking to the Daily , Mr Fischer said: We have pushed him off the pedestal. We must not hide anything. Healing is knowledge.Professor Litvack stated that Sir Hans# we was associated with the slave trade but that is not all that he is.The worrying thing for me about Black Lives Matter and other movements like that is they are movements of a moment, he said. They are very emotive and they have caused a response in the public arena that sometimes is not as considered as it normally would be. There#s a lot of knee jerk reactions that emerged when Black Lives Matter first came to light.I think it#s important, especially for museums, to hang back and think what does this mean in the larger context of who we are and what we do Sir Hans is also honoured by a number of place names, including London#s Sloane Square.The de-ing of the Sir Hans bust is one part of a raft of changes being made to the British Museum, which will involve prominently acknowledging its links to the slave trade and the imperialist actions from which the museum profited.Belfast Most ReadIncident in which NI restaurant turned away ambulance worker because of Covid risk #regrettable#, says hospitality chiefSupplier to Wrightbus goes bust with loss of  jobsSix remanded in custody as lawyers claim involvement of #agent provocateur# in New IRA probe Man attacked by group of youths in Belfast sectarian hate crime Ciaran BarnesOpinionBig mouths brought New IRA to its knees,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The World Health Organisation and UN children#s agency Unicef advise that children aged  and over should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee at least a one-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area.The Schools Standards Minister in England Nick Gibb had indicated that hygiene measures put in place in classes meant masks were not required. Mr Gibb told the BBC: If a school puts in place the measures that are in the guidance that we issued in early July, all the hygiene measures that I#ve been talking about, then masks are not necessary for staff or pupils. England#s deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries said the evidence on whether children over  should wear masks in schools was not strong. However, older pupils in Scotland will be required to wear face coverings in between lessons from next week.Face coverings should be worn by staff and pupils when moving around secondary schools in Scotland from August , according to Holyrood#s Education Secretary.John Swinney said that the rule will apply on school transport for primary school pupils aged five and above, and all those at secondary school in communal areas, but not in classrooms.Previous advice in Northern Ireland had made it mandatory for all pupils aged  and over to wear a face covering on public transport, or when large numbers of staff or pupils gathered within an enclosed space where social distancing was not possible.However, they were not generally recommended for routine use in schools.But last night Mr Weir said: Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time.The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings.My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so.In relation to communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible. Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings.I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice.Sinn Fein MLA John O#Dowd has said the decision should have been introduced with immediate effect.The Upper Bann MLA and former Education Minister said: The safety of children and young people while at school is an absolute priority for everyone.New guidance from the World Health Organisation has strongly recommended the need to introduce the wearing of face coverings in secondary schools.While the decision to introduce the wearing of face coverings in school corridors, communal areas and school transport is welcome, it should be implemented immediately, not with any delay.This latest move by the Minister is yet another example of lack of clear decision-making and guidance which has caused confusion for parents, teachers and students.Belfast Most ReadIncident in which NI restaurant turned away ambulance worker because of Covid risk #regrettable#, says hospitality chiefSupplier to Wrightbus goes bust with loss of  jobsSix remanded in custody as lawyers claim involvement of #agent provocateur# in New IRA probe Man attacked by group of youths in Belfast sectarian hate crime Ciaran BarnesOpinionBig mouths brought New IRA to its knees,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, not all parents noty us that their children are home educated.Read More Concern over Scots coming to NI for Covid- testing Hospital#s two Covid clusters #shows fragile state of NHS#  Cover up in the school corridor: Northern Ireland#s post-primary pupils should wear masks outside class at all times, says Education MinisterDuring the - academic year, the EA was notied of  young people as being home-schooled with a further  from April . The Home Education in the North West group also reported an increased interest from parents.Some have jumped at the opportunity and have already sent in their deregisteration letters to their schools, a spokesperson said. Others are now seriously considering keeping their kids home and have joined the group to test the waters.Offering advice, the spokesperson said that home-schooled children still have plenty of opportunities for socialising and that parents can tailor teaching.She added that families should establish a timetable that fits their routine, to make the most of one-to-one attention and use a mixture of online resources and traditional learning.Making use of the local library, spending more time learning outdoors and getting in touch with other home school families in the area was also recommended.Experienced home schooler Susan Keenanfrom east Belfast took her sons Benand Tomout of class for two years, travelling to the Far East with her husband Michael .This term they are ing to class by choice at Sullivan Upper, but Susan said she fully understands why more parents will want to continue lessons at home.Ben started back into fourth year and Tom is due to start third year. Tom#s happy to go back while Ben#s not so sure it#s what he wants to do, she said.So I#ve told him just to try it and see how he feels about it, andhe wants to continue with home schooling he can.She added: I think after lockdown a lot more parents have realised how much you can get done on a one-to-one basis.You can get through the curriculum much quicker at home, but then there is the socialising aspect at school. But I don#t know how much socialising there#s really going to be at the minute.Kids will be in their bubbles and only mixing in their own class.While acknowledging home schooling wasn#t for everyone, she disagreed it damaged future job prospects.Absolutely not, because I do think a lot more rounded learning goes on at home rather than the rote learning you do to get ready for your exams.I know when we went away with our children they learnt about dferent cultures and religions, food and more.So I do think you need to encourage your children to get their qualications in case they want to go university and we didn#t want our decisions to negatively impact on any future choices they will have.

Sinn Feacutein’s Karen Mullan has voiced her ‘disappointment and concern’ at the ‘unwillingness’ of Robin Swann to provide essential funding to keep Derry’s Community Crisis Intervention Servicerunning. While the SDLP’s Mark H Durkan said like everything asked for in the North West it has become a ‘whole battle’. He described the service as a ‘huge success’ which has been a literal ‘leline’ to many. Bereaved local families, activists and organisations campaigned for a service of this kind for years. googletag.cmd.push CCIS provides a ‘safe space’ for those in crisis from pm on Thursdays until am on Sundays when many other services are not operational. It is run by Extern NI from the Holywell Building on Bishop Street. People experiencing a mental health crisis are referred to the service by the PSNI and Foyle Search  Rescue or attend of their own volition. Iniduals receive immediate support forgoing the need to attend a busy hospital Emergency Department. They are also directed to additional support servicesnecessary. An independent Ulster University report found the service to be cost-effective. Figures released by the Western Trust demonstrate the need for enhanced mental health provision in the city. googletag.cmd.push At the end of June  people were waiting more than nine weeks to access adult mental health services. There were  young people waiting more than nine weeks to access child and adolescent mental health services , as of June . Foyle Search  Rescue has also responded to many emergency incidents in recent months despite a period of lockdown. ‘UNTHINKABLE’ Karen Mullan said the minister has declined requests from her and party colleagues to meet to discuss the need to fund the CCIS and mental health services in the city. She added: “Derry City and the North West area a is being neglected by the Minister and his unwillingness to invest in mental health support services. “The Community Crisis Intervention Service is a service dealing with iniduals who are facing a crisis and need de-escalation. “This crisis can be due to a mental health episode or as a result of substance misuse. “All these issues fall firmly under the remit of the Department for Health and as such the minister. “Icallon Minister Swann to provide the funding for the Intervention service and investment in mental health provision in the City.” In June the health minister visited Derry where he announced pound, of additional funding to keep the service running for three months. Mark H Durkan said it is impossible to measure the positive impact it has had and he ‘shuddered’ to think about what could have happened without it. He continued: “We were able to convince the Minister to extend funding on an interim basis. “We have to remember that tackling the mental health crisis is an Executive priority so it’s not just one for the Department of Health. “They’ve made positive noises but that has to be backed by action and for me it is unthinkable that this service wouldn’t be funded moving forward.” The Foyle MLA said it is unacceptable for service users and hard-working staff to keep getting word of short extensions and that a permanent commitment must be made. A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council acknowledged that the funding provided would allow for the temporary continuation of the service. However, councillors are of the view that the Department of Health and other government departments should consider a ‘long-term funding arrangement’. In response, a DoH spokesperson said: “The additional funding provided by the Department of Health enabled Derry Crisis Intervention Service to continue until the end of September . “Correspondence from Extern has been received today requesting additional funding to support the service until the end of March . This is currently being considered. If you feel in crisis and need support oryou have observed someone who is in distress and may come to signicant harm through self-harm and suicidal behaviour please call CCIS on:    If you need to speak to someone urgently, please call Leline on   , the Samaritans or attend your local Emergency Department.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The collapse of Stormont coupled with the Department of Health’s view that the school did not demonstrate ‘need and value for money’ led to delays. Finally, in May of this year Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that it had been approved and would open in September . In an in-depth interview with Derry News reporter, Garrett Hargan, Professor Dubras speaks of her elation after discovering the long wait was over, about the hundreds of people who have expressed an interest to date and the wide-ranging benefits that training doctors locally will bring. googletag.cmd.push She also refutes any suggestion that the school will ever be relocated, talks about the prospect of health science courses moving to Magee to complement the medical school and new build projects in the pipeline which will enhance the learning experience for medical students in the city.  For readers who may not know, can you provide a brief background of your career path before taking on the role as Foundation Dean at the Magee Medical School  I’ve been a GP for a long time. My clinical background is that I worked in Southampton looking after homeless people for a long, long time. I was lead GP for a homeless service. googletag.cmd.push From a university perspective, I worked at the University of Southampton for quite a long time and had increasing roles in leadership and ended up running the medical degree programme. I went from there to King’s College in London where I was the Deputy Dean of Medical Education. We were doing a huge curriculum change in this very big medical school, one of the biggest schools in the country with about  students each year. So it was very sizeable and quite a challenge. Then I became the Interim Dean of Medical Education for nine months and then was ready for a new challenge and that’s when this job came up. I arrived in Derry in June . I was really excited about coming here because it was an opportunity to establish something new, obviously with a focus on General Practice. An opportunity to bring my own values to the school and my personal values which have kind of always been about social justice, access and community-based healthcare. It really aligned with the university’s plans. And that’s me in a nutshell. What are your thoughts on the city having lived here for two years now  It’s wonderful, I have felt so welcomed here. I was born and grew up in the Channel Islands, Jersey, and it’s a small community, coastal and I’m kind of used to being in a place where people know other people and I’m used to being somewhere that I can get to the sea. From that perspective I’ve loved it. But I’ve done things like joining Altnagelvin Hospital’s choir, I’m probably the worst member of the choir, but it’s just been lovely and a brilliant way to get to know people. I’ve started running, I joined Star Running Club. Everywhere I’ve gone I’ve been impressed by just how much of a welcoming place the city is. Why did approval for the medical school take so long  It took a little bit longer than I was expecting. But although the journey was a little bit longer and a bit lumpier than I had anticipated, it’s worth it. I think the outcome is a really great one. At this months Western Trust meeting a member of the board said the Department of Health put obstacles in the way. Is that true  No, I don’t think so. It’s been a very thorough process of working with the university to develop our outline business case. And I think the civil service have a responsibility to make sure that these things are robust. At the point where we submitted our final business case to them in October of last year I was confident it was well put together and robust. There was time required for them to consider that. And the Assembly was not in place which was an added dimension to the decision-making process because the civil service aren’t in a position to make that level of decision. So it took longer than any of us expected but with the benefit of hindsight, that was not wasted time. And the GMC process was ongoing in parallel anyway. They visited us in July last year and we did have to pause the process until such time as we had confirmation of student places. But once we resumed the process we were able to pick that up fairly quickly. A little bit longer but I wouldn’t say there was deliberate obstruction at all. How did you feel when it finally got over the line  Oh goodness, delighted. The announcement by the Deputy First Minister in May of our places was just so welcome and then the confirmation that we had by the end of June was equally, each step has been fantastic. But the one that made me feel most excited was the point where the GMC gave agreement that we could recruit staff and students. That was the most signicant for me when our external regulator said it was happy for us to progress. There is some fear in the city, which has been highlighted by local councillors, that the school could be moved given the history of courses being transferred to other campuses. Are there any guarantees that the medical school will not be moved to another campus  I don’t think there’s any question about that, Garrett. How many applications have you received so far for the course  They all go through UCAS and we don’t know how that is going until ious UCAS deadlines are passed. This morning we had the first of a series of webinars with people who are interested in studying with us. We had  people on this morning wanting to know about the programme. We’re running a test centre for The Graduate Medical School Admissions Testand we filled up our places within a week. There is a real interest in coming to study with us. Has a date been set for the GAMSAT  There are two opportunities, one is usually September and the other March. We became registered as a GAMSAT centre as soon as we got the go-ahead to recruit students. Because it’s an Australian company that runs GAMSAT, it’s the kind of gold standard for anyone going in to graduate entry medical school courses. Our September October sittings are full and they will release the dates for March and as soon as those are released people will be able to register. But in order to apply, people don’t have to have taken GAMSAT in those dates. There’s a two-year grace sosomeone did it in  they would still be eligible for our first round of applications. You’ve pointed out that it is not a post-graduate course or limited to people with medical qualications, but open to anyone with a : degree. What fields have applicants come from so far  The beauty of our programme is that we don’t limit it to people with bioscience backgrounds. My experience working with students on other GEMS courses and also the experience of our partner medical school, St George’s in London, is that there’s a real mix of prior backgrounds. You might have people coming in who’ve got Masters of even PhDs in biomedical related subjects but equally I’ve worked with people who’ve come in with degrees in music, who’ve been geography teachers, lawyers, and the interesting thing about graduate entry medicine is that we teach it students work in mixed groups so you’ll find you might have somebody with an English degree working with someone who has a Masters in mechanical engineering or a BSc in biomedical sciences and actually they all learn from each other and are all engaged in that journey. And the people who are non-bioscience in background learn fast and by the end of the first year they are all at the same level and all really benefited from that ersity in backgrounds. At this stage would you know anything about the geographical spread of applicants  We have a database of about  people who have been interested in following the programme and have probably been in contact with us for about three years. They’re fairly widely dispersed, quite a lot of them are from NI and spread out here. Some expressing interest from GB and other international students but there’s a limit to the number of international students any medical school can take. That’s set by the UK government because of the way clinical placements are funded and also going into the foundation programme to become fully registered with the GMC. There’s a cap on medical courses partly because of what it costs to train doctors but in addition to that it’s about the capacity of hospitals and general practices to take those students. We’ve got lots of interest but limited to what we can do internationally. What specic facilities do you need in order to provide the type of first-class course you envisage  We have a building identied for refurbishment. We will have students on campus for their first year and part of their second year. After that they’re largely out on clinical placements and coming back to campus for certain weeks, tutorials and so on. The estate plan is comprehensive to accommodate those students and we’ll be providing them with a range of resources rooms for learning anatomy, for learning clinical skills, communication skills as well as standard tutorial rooms. Do you have those in the current buildings at Magee  Absolutely. Is the aim to still have a new building along the riverfront   Absolutely yeah, we still intend to have our new building but we have the wherewithal and are ready for first intake on the campus.  Would the theory element of the course be taught there once it’s ready  That would be the expectation, yes. Is there any timeline that you’re aware of for that  As you know, the funding for that is within the City Deal process so there will be the standard contractual stuff that will go on. But we have space on the campus to not be pressured for time and ultimately our new build has to be right. It’s not like we’re going to have to move out within a particular timescale. Seventy students have been agreed to begin with a view to increasing that to . Are you confident it will be increased to  and in what timescale are you looking for that to happen  There are ongoing discussions with the Department for the Economy. In our business case we had a sense of how we want to grow year on year but we’re certainly happy to be delivering  doctors a year because that is a substantial addition to the Northern Ireland medical workforce. Does Ulster University have enough experience and expertise to supervise the medical school at council level  One hundred per cent, absolutely. You’ve heard us talk about the rigorous GMC quality assurance process and a lot of that process is about testing out with us, in a very robust way, a whole range of things that include senior level governance, support, commitment, resources so the GMC wouldn’t be permitting us to progressthey weren’t confident in the university’s ability to deliver this. Can you say anything about the plans for on-site teaching facilities at Altnagelvin that were mentioned at the recent Western Trust board meeting  We’re at an early stage of those conversations and obviously we’re working in a partnership with the Trust and we’ll be having conversations with them and with our colleagues at Queens University Belfast. So it’s early days yet with that. Were these plans included in a business case that has already been submitted  Oh yes, it’s costed. Absolutely. Was it with the department of health because a number of departments have said they have no knowledge of it  I can’t remember the details about which department, it was included in the capital requirements within the City Deal. Should health science coursesmove to Magee to complement the medical school and build upon that positive progress, and would you like to see them come  As you know there’s been a consultation on the future location of those courses which has been paused because we’re running a full equality impact assessment. So we’re aiming to resume that shortly. I think from an educational perspective, the more health professionals you are able to educate in the same place the better. Do you think the medical school approval will aid that case  I think it’s a signicant element. Are you confident it will happen and are you personally pushing for that move  It’s subject to consultation, Garrett, so I can’t pre-judge the outcome of a consultation. But you’ve read the consultation document so you know that that’s the university’s preferred outcome . What do you think about a cross-border university named in honour of John Hume that would link UU Magee, the Institute of Technology in Letterkenny  Sligo and North West Regional College   It has been proposed by the Irish government’s Higher Education minister, is that something you’d be supportive of  I think we have to recognise the impact of John Hume as a politician, peace maker and honorary graduate of the university. So John Hume had immense impact and I think we are very keen to work with the Hume Foundation to recognise his contribution in whatever way is most appropriate. And of course, as you know, his daughter is a GP locally so I think commitment to health and social justice are all things which align very much with my own personal values. We have a very strong working relationship with our colleagues at the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, with North West Regional College, so I think from my perspective, the university is going to continue to deepen those working relationships. Student numbers have dropped at Magee every year since. Does the university have to show that it is committed to the campus by delivering on long-promised expansion to , students  I think the mere fact that the university is committed to the school of medicine and training of doctors in the city is evidence of its commitment. Are you aware of a wider strategy to deliver on that promise  I don’t think there’s any doubt about the university’s commitment to the city, as I said, certainly in terms of training doctors, we’ve already talked about the university’s preferred outcome for the health sciences consultation so I think there’s absolutely no doubt about the university’s commitment. Id imagine you have a busy year ahead, what has to be done to ready the school for students in the coming months  As you can see from the university’s marketing material and my tweets and so on you’ll see that we’re actively marketing to recruit students. And we’ll continue that with webinars, we’ll be running the GAMSAT test in October, we aim to run our interviews in JanuaryFebruary of next year whether they are in person or virtual because of COVID. That will be us progressing student recruitment. Then there is staff recruitment which is due to go out in the next week or so. We have a recruitment strategy to get all of those people in post in time for the first students. There’s the building refurbishment, there’s procurement of our virtual learning environment and ious other bits and pieces. So, you’re right, there is plenty to keep us out of mischief. Looking to the future, what will the course bring to the city, and ultimately when these students are able to graduate, how much will that mean to local health care  My goodness, there are so many benefits. One is that we know from really good research over time thatyou train doctors locally they stay local. And will often choose general practice as a career. What it can do for the city first and foremost is, it will grow our health profession workforce. Second is, there is also a huge opportunity to improve morale amongst the workforce who are currently here because they can see real benefit in brining on the future. There’s nothing more exciting than actually working with medical students because they’re amazing people and you know that they’re going to make brilliant doctors. The third thing is that there’s a real opportunity to improve recruitment anyway, because people like to come to places that are involved in medical education. And another benefit is the fact that medical students don’t just stay in their university, they like to get involved with the local community through classes and societies, so they will often run resuscitation training courses for kids in schools, they might work with a range of community groups doing volunteering. So I think everywhere you turn you would see real benefits to the school the medicine and these students in the city.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The collapse of Stormont coupled with the Department of Health’s view that the school did not demonstrate ‘need and value for money’ led to delays. Finally, in May of this year Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that it had been approved and would open in September . In an in-depth interview with Derry News reporter, Garrett Hargan, Professor Dubras speaks of her elation after discovering the long wait was over, about the hundreds of people who have expressed an interest to date and the wide-ranging benefits that training doctors locally will bring. googletag.cmd.push She also refutes any suggestion that the school will ever be relocated, talks about the prospect of health science courses moving to Magee to complement the medical school and new build projects in the pipeline which will enhance the learning experience for medical students in the city.  For readers who may not know, can you provide a brief background of your career path before taking on the role as Foundation Dean at the Magee Medical School  I’ve been a GP for a long time. My clinical background is that I worked in Southampton looking after homeless people for a long, long time. I was lead GP for a homeless service. googletag.cmd.push From a university perspective, I worked at the University of Southampton for quite a long time and had increasing roles in leadership and ended up running the medical degree programme. I went from there to King’s College in London where I was the Deputy Dean of Medical Education. We were doing a huge curriculum change in this very big medical school, one of the biggest schools in the country with about  students each year. So it was very sizeable and quite a challenge. Then I became the Interim Dean of Medical Education for nine months and then was ready for a new challenge and that’s when this job came up. I arrived in Derry in June . I was really excited about coming here because it was an opportunity to establish something new, obviously with a focus on General Practice. An opportunity to bring my own values to the school and my personal values which have kind of always been about social justice, access and community-based healthcare. It really aligned with the university’s plans. And that’s me in a nutshell. What are your thoughts on the city having lived here for two years now  It’s wonderful, I have felt so welcomed here. I was born and grew up in the Channel Islands, Jersey, and it’s a small community, coastal and I’m kind of used to being in a place where people know other people and I’m used to being somewhere that I can get to the sea. From that perspective I’ve loved it. But I’ve done things like joining Altnagelvin Hospital’s choir, I’m probably the worst member of the choir, but it’s just been lovely and a brilliant way to get to know people. I’ve started running, I joined Star Running Club. Everywhere I’ve gone I’ve been impressed by just how much of a welcoming place the city is. Why did approval for the medical school take so long  It took a little bit longer than I was expecting. But although the journey was a little bit longer and a bit lumpier than I had anticipated, it’s worth it. I think the outcome is a really great one. At this months Western Trust meeting a member of the board said the Department of Health put obstacles in the way. Is that true  No, I don’t think so. It’s been a very thorough process of working with the university to develop our outline business case. And I think the civil service have a responsibility to make sure that these things are robust. At the point where we submitted our final business case to them in October of last year I was confident it was well put together and robust. There was time required for them to consider that. And the Assembly was not in place which was an added dimension to the decision-making process because the civil service aren’t in a position to make that level of decision. So it took longer than any of us expected but with the benefit of hindsight, that was not wasted time. And the GMC process was ongoing in parallel anyway. They visited us in July last year and we did have to pause the process until such time as we had confirmation of student places. But once we resumed the process we were able to pick that up fairly quickly. A little bit longer but I wouldn’t say there was deliberate obstruction at all. How did you feel when it finally got over the line  Oh goodness, delighted. The announcement by the Deputy First Minister in May of our places was just so welcome and then the confirmation that we had by the end of June was equally, each step has been fantastic. But the one that made me feel most excited was the point where the GMC gave agreement that we could recruit staff and students. That was the most signicant for me when our external regulator said it was happy for us to progress. There is some fear in the city, which has been highlighted by local councillors, that the school could be moved given the history of courses being transferred to other campuses. Are there any guarantees that the medical school will not be moved to another campus  I don’t think there’s any question about that, Garrett. How many applications have you received so far for the course  They all go through UCAS and we don’t know how that is going until ious UCAS deadlines are passed. This morning we had the first of a series of webinars with people who are interested in studying with us. We had  people on this morning wanting to know about the programme. We’re running a test centre for The Graduate Medical School Admissions Testand we filled up our places within a week. There is a real interest in coming to study with us. Has a date been set for the GAMSAT  There are two opportunities, one is usually September and the other March. We became registered as a GAMSAT centre as soon as we got the go-ahead to recruit students. Because it’s an Australian company that runs GAMSAT, it’s the kind of gold standard for anyone going in to graduate entry medical school courses. Our September October sittings are full and they will release the dates for March and as soon as those are released people will be able to register. But in order to apply, people don’t have to have taken GAMSAT in those dates. There’s a two-year grace sosomeone did it in  they would still be eligible for our first round of applications. You’ve pointed out that it is not a post-graduate course or limited to people with medical qualications, but open to anyone with a : degree. What fields have applicants come from so far  The beauty of our programme is that we don’t limit it to people with bioscience backgrounds. My experience working with students on other GEMS courses and also the experience of our partner medical school, St George’s in London, is that there’s a real mix of prior backgrounds. You might have people coming in who’ve got Masters of even PhDs in biomedical related subjects but equally I’ve worked with people who’ve come in with degrees in music, who’ve been geography teachers, lawyers, and the interesting thing about graduate entry medicine is that we teach it students work in mixed groups so you’ll find you might have somebody with an English degree working with someone who has a Masters in mechanical engineering or a BSc in biomedical sciences and actually they all learn from each other and are all engaged in that journey. And the people who are non-bioscience in background learn fast and by the end of the first year they are all at the same level and all really benefited from that ersity in backgrounds. At this stage would you know anything about the geographical spread of applicants  We have a database of about  people who have been interested in following the programme and have probably been in contact with us for about three years. They’re fairly widely dispersed, quite a lot of them are from NI and spread out here. Some expressing interest from GB and other international students but there’s a limit to the number of international students any medical school can take. That’s set by the UK government because of the way clinical placements are funded and also going into the foundation programme to become fully registered with the GMC. There’s a cap on medical courses partly because of what it costs to train doctors but in addition to that it’s about the capacity of hospitals and general practices to take those students. We’ve got lots of interest but limited to what we can do internationally. What specic facilities do you need in order to provide the type of first-class course you envisage  We have a building identied for refurbishment. We will have students on campus for their first year and part of their second year. After that they’re largely out on clinical placements and coming back to campus for certain weeks, tutorials and so on. The estate plan is comprehensive to accommodate those students and we’ll be providing them with a range of resources rooms for learning anatomy, for learning clinical skills, communication skills as well as standard tutorial rooms. Do you have those in the current buildings at Magee  Absolutely. Is the aim to still have a new building along the riverfront   Absolutely yeah, we still intend to have our new building but we have the wherewithal and are ready for first intake on the campus.  Would the theory element of the course be taught there once it’s ready  That would be the expectation, yes. Is there any timeline that you’re aware of for that  As you know, the funding for that is within the City Deal process so there will be the standard contractual stuff that will go on. But we have space on the campus to not be pressured for time and ultimately our new build has to be right. It’s not like we’re going to have to move out within a particular timescale. Seventy students have been agreed to begin with a view to increasing that to . Are you confident it will be increased to  and in what timescale are you looking for that to happen  There are ongoing discussions with the Department for the Economy. In our business case we had a sense of how we want to grow year on year but we’re certainly happy to be delivering  doctors a year because that is a substantial addition to the Northern Ireland medical workforce. Does Ulster University have enough experience and expertise to supervise the medical school at council level  One hundred per cent, absolutely. You’ve heard us talk about the rigorous GMC quality assurance process and a lot of that process is about testing out with us, in a very robust way, a whole range of things that include senior level governance, support, commitment, resources so the GMC wouldn’t be permitting us to progressthey weren’t confident in the university’s ability to deliver this. Can you say anything about the plans for on-site teaching facilities at Altnagelvin that were mentioned at the recent Western Trust board meeting  We’re at an early stage of those conversations and obviously we’re working in a partnership with the Trust and we’ll be having conversations with them and with our colleagues at Queens University Belfast. So it’s early days yet with that. Were these plans included in a business case that has already been submitted  Oh yes, it’s costed. Absolutely. Was it with the department of health because a number of departments have said they have no knowledge of it  I can’t remember the details about which department, it was included in the capital requirements within the City Deal. Should health science coursesmove to Magee to complement the medical school and build upon that positive progress, and would you like to see them come  As you know there’s been a consultation on the future location of those courses which has been paused because we’re running a full equality impact assessment. So we’re aiming to resume that shortly. I think from an educational perspective, the more health professionals you are able to educate in the same place the better. Do you think the medical school approval will aid that case  I think it’s a signicant element. Are you confident it will happen and are you personally pushing for that move  It’s subject to consultation, Garrett, so I can’t pre-judge the outcome of a consultation. But you’ve read the consultation document so you know that that’s the university’s preferred outcome . What do you think about a cross-border university named in honour of John Hume that would link UU Magee, the Institute of Technology in Letterkenny  Sligo and North West Regional College   It has been proposed by the Irish government’s Higher Education minister, is that something you’d be supportive of  I think we have to recognise the impact of John Hume as a politician, peace maker and honorary graduate of the university. So John Hume had immense impact and I think we are very keen to work with the Hume Foundation to recognise his contribution in whatever way is most appropriate. And of course, as you know, his daughter is a GP locally so I think commitment to health and social justice are all things which align very much with my own personal values. We have a very strong working relationship with our colleagues at the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, with North West Regional College, so I think from my perspective, the university is going to continue to deepen those working relationships. Student numbers have dropped at Magee every year since. Does the university have to show that it is committed to the campus by delivering on long-promised expansion to , students  I think the mere fact that the university is committed to the school of medicine and training of doctors in the city is evidence of its commitment. Are you aware of a wider strategy to deliver on that promise  I don’t think there’s any doubt about the university’s commitment to the city, as I said, certainly in terms of training doctors, we’ve already talked about the university’s preferred outcome for the health sciences consultation so I think there’s absolutely no doubt about the university’s commitment. Id imagine you have a busy year ahead, what has to be done to ready the school for students in the coming months  As you can see from the university’s marketing material and my tweets and so on you’ll see that we’re actively marketing to recruit students. And we’ll continue that with webinars, we’ll be running the GAMSAT test in October, we aim to run our interviews in JanuaryFebruary of next year whether they are in person or virtual because of COVID. That will be us progressing student recruitment. Then there is staff recruitment which is due to go out in the next week or so. We have a recruitment strategy to get all of those people in post in time for the first students. There’s the building refurbishment, there’s procurement of our virtual learning environment and ious other bits and pieces. So, you’re right, there is plenty to keep us out of mischief. Looking to the future, what will the course bring to the city, and ultimately when these students are able to graduate, how much will that mean to local health care  My goodness, there are so many benefits. One is that we know from really good research over time thatyou train doctors locally they stay local. And will often choose general practice as a career. What it can do for the city first and foremost is, it will grow our health profession workforce. Second is, there is also a huge opportunity to improve morale amongst the workforce who are currently here because they can see real benefit in brining on the future. There’s nothing more exciting than actually working with medical students because they’re amazing people and you know that they’re going to make brilliant doctors. The third thing is that there’s a real opportunity to improve recruitment anyway, because people like to come to places that are involved in medical education. And another benefit is the fact that medical students don’t just stay in their university, they like to get involved with the local community through classes and societies, so they will often run resuscitation training courses for kids in schools, they might work with a range of community groups doing volunteering. So I think everywhere you turn you would see real benefits to the school the medicine and these students in the city.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dara saw off tough competition from Paloma Faith’s other acts, Isla and Hayley, to become her representative in the final four. ”You have this amazing talent that’s technical but feels so sensitive,” said the coach. ”That feeds into the way you sing because it’s just pure beauty.” The St Colm’s High School pupil was congratulated by his family after his performance and can now look forward to the final round of the competition. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jeananne Craig worked in the English capital and Dublin for more than a decade, reporting on breaking news and showbiz red carpets.  But after the birth of her second child in , the Rosemount woman decided to relocate to the city where she grew up. “I had a great time in London and some amazing experiences there, but like many Derry people living away from home, I always missed it,” Jeananne said. “We moved to Derry a year and a half ago and are so happy to be here, particularly in the last six months, when having a bit more space and being close to family and nature has been so important.” googletag.cmd.push With a growing trend for people looking to leave built-up cities for quieter, more affordable locations post-lockdown, Jeananne decided to share her experience and that of other ‘city quitters’ in a podcast. All Change Please is co-hosted by Jeananne, who now works as a freelance journalist and copywriter, and her friend and fellow journalist, Jayne Cherrington-Cook, who left London for Kent. They release new episodes fortnightly and interviewees in series one include s music royalty-turned-designer Pearl Lowe, who moved from London to Somerset, Irish presenter and illustrator Maggie Molloy, and original Big Brother winner Craig Phillips, who reveals he once rented a room from the shows notorious Nasty Nick. googletag.cmd.push We cover all sorts of topics, from the practicalities of moving, to working from home and making friends somewhere new - and whether people have any regrets about leaving a big city, said Jeananne. Its all done remotely with Jayne in Kent, me in Derry and our guest joining from wherever theyre based. I actually have to record in my parents house, my own is too noisy with two young children running around and wanting to join in, said Jeananne who, plans to include some well-known local names soon.The logo for All Change Please was designed by local artist Bronach Crabtee, aka The Crafty Crab. The plan is to attract listeners considering a move, but I think our interviewees have such interesting stories to tell, it will make a good listen for anyone looking for a new podcast to enjoy, Jeananne added. The first two episodes of All Change Please are online now, with new episodes released fortnightly on a Thursday. The podcast is available on iTunes, Spoty and Acast, and is on Twitter @allchangepod https:podcasts.apple gb podcast all-change-please id  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Micky Doherty was presented with the Foyle Pride Mark Ashton Award for Outstanding Contribution to the LGBTQ+ community by the citys real Mayor, SDLP Councillor Brian Tierney, at a ceremony at the Holywell Trusts Garden of Remembrance on Saturday night. A spokesperson for Foyle Pride said Mr Doherty, who fronts the citys Pride parade each year, was a truly deserving winner who does so much, for not only the LGBTQ+ community, but also the wider city and district community. Mr Doherty is a tireless charity fundraiser and helped set up a special fund to help local people in need during the oronavirus crisis. googletag.cmd.push Im known in the local area as being a charity fundraiser-theres a charity fundraiser Ill host it, said Mr Doherty. Its just part of me that I like helping people. During lockdown I knew people had started to struggle and they were coming to me and I started to think about how I could help. Because I have been working with charities for a long time people put their trust in me. Mr Doherty was hosting a drive through bingo event last week when he got a phone call to say he had won the Foyle Pride award. I just burst out crying, he admitted. I really didnt expect it so I was just overwhelmed. googletag.cmd.push I just have so much gratitude for the award and for everyone who nominated me and I want to thank them all. Mr Doherty said he wished his late mum, Cathy, could have been there on Saturday to see him receive his award. Its hard to accept that my mammy couldnt be there, he said. Its just not the same without her but I am still filled with so much gratitude for it, he said. Derry LGBT+ campaigner, Suzanna Toland, who passed away earlier this year, was remembered at Saturdays ceremony. It was really nice to see Suzanna recognised for everything that she did, said Micky. She was a very special person.Before she passed away she had set up an LGBT+ disco at Rosie Joes so that people would have a safe place to socialise.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In family, business and community. Devastation and disbelief reached into every corner of County Derry last Friday afternoon, as the news of his sudden death filtered through. Everyone I spoke with over the weekend was just in shock. My thoughts are with his we Anne and the entire family, as they unite in grief. Rarely would you see Hugh without Anne. They went everywhere together. His family were never far behind. My sympathy also goes out to his daughter Maureen, son Carlus, son-in-law Benny, daughter-in-law Maria, his grandchildren Ollie, Leo, Fiadh and Lily Anna. Its not often you go to Owenbeg that you dont see them all there to take in a game, no matter who is playing. googletag.cmd.push Hugh Peter was well-known far from his own townland of Cloane. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, a company he started in  with his we Anne. Together, they grew the firm from six employees to over . When you think of a local community, the provision of local jobs is unquantiable. The parish of Ballinascreen and the surrounding areas have benefited greatly. In terms of an amateur sport, like GAA, one of the factors rarely mentioned is the importance of clubs not losing players forced to emigrate in search of work. This cant be done without stable employers, without people like Hugh McWilliams. googletag.cmd.push Then there is the sponsorship element. Hugh and Anne have been the Derry GAAs main sponsor since taking over at the end of the  season. They also sponsor the camogie and ladies football teams, while also backing the senior football and hurling leagues. Derrys statement last week was very apt, labelling Hugh as a giant of generosity and all at a time when the HA logo wasnt splashed across the national media like the big hitters of Dublin, Kerry and Kilkenny. Closer to home, HA are also in their fth year as Ballinascreens main sponsor, also across all four codes. Other examples of Hughs generosity went unnoticed, away from having a company brand associated with it. All the local schools benefited from his support, local mental health charity STEPS and St Vincent de Paul. The list could go on. Two years ago, to celebrate  years of HA, he held a family fun day at the local An Raacuteth Dubh Community Centre. From the moment you walked through the gate, everything was on Hughs tab...from the bouncy castles to the refreshments. They also organised a charity golf day and coffee morning, with all three events raising pound,. He bumped the total up himself, so both charities – Cancer Fund for Children and South Derry Downs Syndrome - were presented with cheques for poundk. For such a successful business man, he never forgot where he came from. He wasnt shy about putting something back. And all with modesty, far from any fanfare. One of the most enjoyable years of my le was the summer of , training the Derry minor team. A swing of Damien Reddingtons left boot may have snatched the All-Ireland minor title from our grasp, but I feel much richer for being involved with that group. We had some craic along the way - sailing up and down the M in the big yellow bus, with the tunes belting and the summer opening up in front of us. There was also a special bond with the supporters and parents. It was the first time I met Hugh Peter. He left Carlus to the bus one Saturday morning when we were Ballyshannon bound to play Roscommon in a challenge game. The Rossies had won the All-Ireland the previous year and Hugh was asking how long I thought the Derry minors summer would last. We hadnt a clue. It was one eventful step at a time. Fast forward to September and as I got off the bus and trudged through the lobby of Dublins Crown Plaza after the All-Ireland final heartbreak, Hugh came forward to shake my hand. Defeat was gurgling in the pit of both our stomachs. I cant remember exactly what he said, but, he was thanking us, while relaying how much his son had enjoyed the journey. Years later when John Francis Bradley, who also played on the same minor team, was seriously injured in a car crash and fighting for his le. Ballinascreen club, with Hugh McWilliams at the forefront, arranged a Night for JF. Screen club was packed. You couldnt have turned a sweet in your mouth. In hospital that night, John Francis spoke for the first time since his accident. The next morning Hugh delivered the many items from the auction to the Bradley family and gave him a pathway back into work. The club later handed over the money donated on the night. Another example of giving. You could write a book. A few months after that All-Ireland minor final, Hugh arranged for a gathering of the squad at the Hogan Stand Bar in Moneyneena. There was music, a buffet, craic and Hugh was in his element. It was like closure on the season. I always enjoy calling into the Hogan Stand and the owner, Tempo man Charlie McNally, claims his porter is the best around. If Hugh was there, he would always send a pint down my direction, like he did for many others. He would never accept one back, but would merely invite you into a football debate with him and Pele, his close friend John Scullion. Hugh would love it. The topic was usually - Screen, Slaughtneil, the Derry championship, the county scene and back to Screen again. Often there would be agreement, sometimes there wasnt and the slagging would begin before theydto chatting with their wives Anne and Mary G. The four of them were so close. Tuesday was no doubt tough day for everyone in the McWilliams family circle, in Ballinascreen and beyond as they said their final goodbye. Hugh often coined the phrase its not about being here for a long time, its about being here for a good time. He always had time for a smile, time for a chat and enjoyed le to the full. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends. I count myself lucky to have known him.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Declan Devine has insisted that his players are ready as the clock ticks down towards this evenings Europa League tie with FK Riteriai in Vilnius. The Candystripes boss and his squad left Derry yesterday and flew directly to Lithuania where they have put in place their final preparations for this evening’s game against the Knights, with victory meaning over pound, to the club. City got back to winning ways at the weekend with a deserved - win over Cork City at the Brandywell, a victory which came at the exact right time for Devine and his team who have struggled since football resumed last month. googletag.cmd.push Devine was part of the City management team which flourished on the continent in  against IFK Gothenburg, Gretna and Paris St. Germain and knows full well the joy of winning at the highest level. “Its one of the highlights of your season and something that you reflect back on,” he said. “Some of the European ties Ive been involved in, both with this club and other clubs, have been highlights and memories that live with you for a long time. When you reflect back you want to remember winning thats the ultimate one because you want to progress through a round. googletag.cmd.push “Our recent history, barring Aberystwyth, hasnt been great. Weve qualied which is a sense of achievement, but we have to try and strive to be better we have to get through a round or two and try and make sure its a regular occurrence that we are playing in these types of games.” Devine has dismissed any notion that FK Riteriai are there to be beaten on Tuesday, with the Lithuanians struggling badly in their domestic league. Riteriai have played  league games in A Lyga this season, and won just one game, losing  in the process. Yet Devine believes that their league performance is not a fair reflection of the quality within the team. “This is a tough game,” he said. “Ive watched a lot of them, they are technically very good footballers, but we are going out to try and win a game. We have to be at our very, very best, as everyone has to be in Europe. We cant afford an off night because the stakes are so high. We want to be in this competition for more than  minutes so its all about the performance on the night. “This season has been absolutely nuts. I’ve never seen anything like in in  years in football. Its not something that we really enjoy playing in front of empty stadiums, but its a game of football, its a -minute game that could potentially could go to  minutes and penalties. There are no excuses, we have got to perform on the night and Ive every confidence the boys can do that.”                                                                                    --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There have been some fantastic European adventures at the club over the years and ahead of this season’s Europa League adventure, we look back on some of the biggest nights in Derry City history.  September ,  Derry City , Benfica  The city came to a standstill on Wednesday, September  as Benfica, one of the true European powerhouses, arrived at the Brandywell, with Portugues legend Eusebio in tow. Derry City held their own for an hour but the class of Benfica shone through as they opened the scoring. Benfica substitute Vata got down the wing and crossed and although Vaudequin headed clear, the ball came to Swedish international Jonas Thern, who took a touch before driving the ball across the face of goal and past Tim Dalton into the corner from  yards. googletag.cmd.push Just five minutes later Benfica doubled their lead. Paniera’s corner caused pandemonium in the City penalty area and although Aldair’s shot was blocked, the loose ball came to Ricardo, whose shot beat Dalton, only to be headed off the line by Kevin Brady. The referee’s assistant raised his flag and signalled that the ball had crossed the line and referee Guy Goethals awarded the goal. Derry City were now up against it but on  minutes the Brandywell was brought back to le. Liam Coyle’s through ball sent Felix Healy in behind the Benfica defence and his left-footed shot across goal beat Silvinho, only to bounce back off the base of the post. googletag.cmd.push Fortunately for Derry, the loose ball ran into the path of Paul Carlyle, who kept his composure to drill the ball into the vacant goal from  yards. The fans exploded into le. Derry City were back in the tie. For all their efforts though, McLaughlin’s team could not get the equaliser in the closing stages, but their showing against one of the strongest teams in Europe was not lost on their supporters, who gave them a standing ovation after the game.  August ,  Derry City , Lokomotiv Sofia  Felix Healy’s Derry City side were expected to be second best in their Cup Winners’ Cup tie against Lokomotiv Sofia, the full-timers from Bulgaria. Those fortunate to bag a ticket for the game were to witness a truly historic day at the Brandywell as Derry finally got their first European win as a League of Ireland team. . The only goal of the game came just before half time when Sofia goalkeeper Ruman Apostolev misjudged a cross from Harry McCourt and the ball flicked off the underside of the crossbar before being cleared. However, the linesman signalled that the ball had crossed the line, and much to the dismay of the visitors, the goal was awarded. McCourt’s goal proved to be enough and the final whistle brought memorable scenes at the Brandywell, with a whole generation of City fans seeing their team victorious in European competition for the first time.  August ,  Apoel Nicosia , Derry City  Just two days after facing Barcelona at the Brandywell, the Candy Stripes were in Cyprus for their UEFA Cup tie against Apoel Nicosia and it proved to be a signicant occasion as Derry City finally hit an away goal in a European tie. It had taken almost  years for the Brandywell club to achieve such a feat, with games against Cardf City, Benfica, Vitesse Arnhem, Lokomotiv Sofia and Maribor all drawing a blank. The right man in the right place proved to be none other than Gary Beckett, who scored on the stroke of half time to cancel out Wojciech Kowlczyk’s earlier effort. Nicosia went on to win the game - thanks to Stelios Okkarides’ second half strike, but the crucial away goal meant that Dermot Keely’s side were still in with a chance of progression ahead of the home tie at the Brandywell.  July ,  IFK Gothenburg , Derry City  The great result in the club’s history  Every Derry City fan will be able to say where they were and what they doing when news filtered through from Sweden that the Candy Stripes had beaten IFK Gothenburg on their own patch. For those lucky enough to be in attendance at the Ullevi Stadium, it was scarcely believable and tales of the celebrations which followed the final whistle became as legendary as Sean Hargan’s winning goal. The game was still in the balance until the th minute when Derry ventured forward and won a corner. In a moment never to be forgotten by the small number of Derry City fans in attendance, Kevin Deery floated a corner into the penalty area where Sean Hargan jumped highest to send the ball back across goal and into the net. It was an unstoppable header. With time running out, goalkeeper David Forde produced arguably his two best saves in a Derry City shirt, two world class saves in the space of a minute to keep Gothenburg at bay.  August ,  Gretna , Derry City  Another amazing result, another amazing night for Derry City as  Candystripes packed into Motherwell’s Fir Park to watch a demolition. It all went to plan for Gretna in the opening stages of the game and a nervy start from the Candy Stripes was punished when they fell behind as Ryan McGuffie scored after just eight minutes. Midway through the first half, things started to go wrong for the hosts as Derry City equalised, Darren Kelly meeting the ball with a firm header, sending it into the net to level the tie with a vital away goal. The teams remained level at half time, but Derry City were out again quickly, and in one of the most stunning halves in the club’s history, they blew Gretna away with an incredible display of attacking football. Two brilliant goals from Kevin Deery, including a blistering -yard free kick, put City in control but there was still ore to come. Derry took advantage of a stunned Gretna, Ciaran Martyn scoring two brilliant inidual goals, right in front of the City fans, who were in dreamland.  September ,  Derry City , Paris St. Germain  September  was a huge date in the history of Derry City Football Club as the mighty Paris St. Germain arrived at the Brandywell to great fanfare. The game itself produced another valiant performance from the Candy Stripes, as they showed respect, but no fear, to their glamourous opponents. Twice in the opening stages Killian Brennan came close, shooting just wide before sending a magnicent shot from  yards onto the crossbar. But as the game went on, the French side began to settle and Brennan had to be a hero at the other end as he cleared the ball off the line after Fabrice Pancrate’s header had beaten David Forde. Darren Kelly then cleared the ball off the line a second time as PSG took control and Derry were glad to survive until half time. Perhaps the game’s defining moment came just after the break when Kevin McHugh broke into the PSG penalty area and was brought down. Everyone in red and white screamed for a penalty but Slovakian referee Richard Havrilla said no. It wasn’t to be, but a - draw kept Derry in with a fighting chance ahead of the second leg in Paris.  July ,  Aberystwyth , Derry City  Derry City produced arguably their best performance of the  season, as they hit five in a Europeaan away game for the second time in  years. Leading - from the first leg, City showed no mercy. They cruised into a - lead within  minutes. Headed goals from Michael Duffy and Barry McNamee ended the tie as a contest but City were far from finished. A second half hat trick from Rory Patterson, the third of which was a cheeky penalty dinked down the middle, secured an outstanding - win on the night, and a - victory on aggregate. The score line was also the highest ever recorded for an Irish side in European football history.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Candystripes crashed out of the Europa League following a - loss after extra time in Vilnius, despite leading - through Joe Thomson’s goal early on. Devine believes that a poor defence and not going for the jugular when ahead so early on were the key factors in the defeat. “It was a real wasted opportunity tonight to progress from the qualying round,” he said. “The manner in which we conceded the goals was very disappointing but we were very wasteful also in front of goal. You can’t afford to give any team the goals we gave them tonight. It’s been something that’s happened in a few game already this season and something we have to address. googletag.cmd.push “Our management of the game wasn’t what it should have been, we should have been really going for the jugular and killing the game of in the early stages of the first half. We started the game really well but finished the first half really disappointed.” Devine believes the loss of both Walter Figueira and Jack Malone before the game had a signicant impact on the performance and result. “We were missing both Jack Malone and Walter Figueira who both picked up injuries in the last two days and they were huge losses to us, so we were down to the bare bones on terms of our squad,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “We’re absolutely gutted and disappointed for the effort that we put into the game but you can’t expect to concede the goals we conceded tonight and expect to qualy through a round of Europe. At the minute it’s very disappointing for everybody”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I am very proud that our incoming head boy, Cormac Savage, was at the forefront of this campaign and believe his contribution was pivotal in ensuring that the sense of injustice and unfairness felt by his peers was articulated in a forceful and timely manner.Mr McCann also welcomed confirmation that GCSE grades will be awarded as calculated by schools.ldquoTeachers were asked to exercise professional judgment and engaged in a robust process to ensure that pupil effort and attainment in the period from September  to the unexpected and unprecedented closing of schools in March was rewarded, he said. ldquoA great deal of time and energy was devoted to this task by the staff of St. Patrickrsquos Grammar to ensure that grades were awarded fairly and consistently.Down High principal Maud Perry, said after the initial publication of results last Thursday the school was celebrating its best ever A-Level achievements.ldquoThis was unsurprising, as this particular year group achieved the schoolrsquos best ever AS results last year, she said.ldquoThis was a very dferent year in so many ways, but Down High pupils continue to be among the best qualied of their generation and, beyond the curriculum, our pupils are enriched, socially confident and ready to take their place as leaders of the future in whatever fields they choose. Congratulations to all of the pupils on these fully deserved grades.Shimna Integrated College principal Kevin Lambe congratulated the schoolrsquos ldquowonderful A level students who weathered the storm of this unprecedented year.He said he was delighted that the vast majority of students had already been placed at their first choice of university before the restoration of the teacher assessed grades on Monday afternoon.Mr Lambe said that while there had been considerable controversy about the process of awarding grades this year, he paid tribute to the excellent guidance document CCEA provided and to the commitment and energy his staff brought to the grading process.ldquoI am quite sure that the moderation process was undertaken in good faith, but it caused dreadful damage and heartache across the country, he said. ldquoThe CCEA guidance was sound, the work of teachers was thoroughgoing, the teacher awarded grades were the right ones and I am absolutely delighted that they have been restored.Ballynahinchrsquos Assumption Grammar School said it was delighted with the government U-turn in awarding grades as the original process ldquocaused signicant emotional upheaval which affected students, parents and our staff.ldquoWe are fortunate in that over % of our A students had already accessed their chosen university or workplace and hope that now almost every girl has achieved their true potential and will be able to access a iety of career pathways. Assumption Girls set the highest of standards year on year and we are proud of our Year  Girls who excelled in every subject at every level, said a school statement.ldquoOur AS students now have a solid foundation of grades which will give them the confidence to believe in their own potential to achieve at the highest of levels as they enter A level. We wish our GCSE girls the best of luck for tomorrowrsquos results.Castlewellanrsquos St Malachyrsquos High School said it was pleased with Education Minister Peter Weirrsquos announcement that AS and A level students will receive their centre assessment grades or the grade awarded by the examining body, whichever is higher.ldquoWe continue to work hard in St Malachyrsquos in the best interests of all our young people, said a statement issued on Monday evening. We are all here in St Malachyrsquos to help and support our students in the best way we can. Congratulations on their wonderful achievements we wish them all the very best in the future.De La Salle High School principal Ciaran Maguire described the past academic year for students as ldquochallenging.He said students adhered to social distancing guidelines collecting their results last Thursday, with the school delighted with their overall grades.ldquoA-Level results across the province has been one of confusion and uncertainty, said Mr Maguire.ldquoWe as a school were relieved that the majority of the teacher assessment grades were secured for our pupils and will continue to appeal and challenge those that need to be addressed to ensure that all pupils get the right outcome, allowing them to progress in an ever changing world.Before Mondayrsquos announcement, Mr Mark Morgan, principal at St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch, said the continued year on year improvement in grades from the students appeared to have been curtailed by the examination bodies.He said teacher predicted grades, which were in line with all the tracking data, appeared to have been totally ignored and grades were given that bore no reflection to the historic and contemporaneous standard attained by students at the school.St Maryrsquos High School in Downpatrick congratulated its A-Level and AS-Level students who received their results.The school said the studentsrsquo success was a ldquoreflection of their hard work, determination to succeed and dedicated teaching staff who always go the extra mile.ldquoOur steady, upward trend in examination results has continued this year and we wish our students all the very best as they begin their studies at university, the statement added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 53.jpg","title":"53 dogs put down in past year – one third of all in NI  ","story":"A LOCAL politician says she is ldquoheartbroken that more dogs being put to sleep in Newry, Mourne and Down than any other council area in Northern Ireland.Fty-three dogs were destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down in - out of a total of  for the whole province.Thatrsquos almost twice as many as the next highest area, which is Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon with .By contrast six councils reported single figure death rates, while not a single dog was put to sleep in Ards and North Down.Rowallane area councillor Kathryn Owen says the figure for Newry, Mourne and Down makes for ldquogrim reading.Cllr Owen, who has four dogs, says the council should look to the successful measures being implemented in other council areas.ldquoTo say Irsquom heartbroken about the immense number of dogs destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down District would be an understatement, she said.ldquoThis is not a statistic that we should be proud of.

The Minister cannot allow all this to simply be thrown away.Ms Armstrong said the local community previously stood together to save Exploris and would do so again.She added: ldquoI would urge anyone with concerns to make their voice heard and lodge their concerns and together we can save our local economy.It is believed that the poundm aquarium proposal for Belfast could create more than  full-time jobs and would be the biggest attraction of its kind on the island of Ireland, with city planners recommending that the new development should be given the green light.The firm behind it, reefLIVE, says around  to  jobs could be created during its construction, with  full-time posts created when it opens its doors, subject to securing planning approval.The aquarium would be a two-storey building, based across more than , sq ft and include a cafe, coral reef ocean tank, with the main exhibition space across five zones on the first floor ndash themed as Ireland, Deep Ocean, Azores, Pacic and Arctic.Around  representations were received in relation to the planning application, including  letters of objection.Concerns included the impact to traffic and travel, the impact on heritage for both listed buildings and monuments, flooding and the potential negative impact on the Exploris aquarium in Portaferry.Those behind the planned tourist attraction say it is anticipated the reefLIVE Aquarium will be the largest marine-le visitor attraction on the island of Ireland and in bringing another international-standard attraction to the Titanic Quarter, would help to boost theof tourist visits to the city.In recommending the scheme for approval, Belfast City Council planners said that ldquohaving regard to the development plan and other material considerations, including the issues raised by the representation, the proposal is considered and approval of planning permission is recommended with delegated authority given to the director of planning and building control to finalise the wording of conditions subject to no new substantive planning issues being raised by third parties..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 Celebrations.jpg","title":"Celebrations to mark the end of WW2  ","story":"CHURCH bells rang out across Killyleagh on Saturday morning to mark the th anniversary of VJ Day.The bells of St Johnrsquos Church of Ireland were tolled as part of the UK-wide commemorations of the anniversary.The day when the Second World War finally ended was celebrated with a short interdenominational act of remembrance at the War Memorial.At am former Army chaplain Hector Wanliss gave a ure reading and led prayers of thanksgiving for the men of Killyleagh, Shrigley and district who went to war, and for peace.Then Last Post and Reveille were sounded by Ronnie Cromie and Wilmer Cromie before two minutesrsquo silence was observed and Binyonrsquos Lines were recited by Billy Croskery, the chairman of Killyleagh and Killinchy Royal British Legion.A wreath was then laid by Mr Croskery, who was escorted by Kevin Kelly.Sadly Killyleaghrsquos last remaining Second World War veteran, Martin `Tinarsquo Charters, who is aged , was not able to take part on this occasion.Social distancing measures were in place and the organisers are grateful for those who attended adhering to these.It was a timely reminder that the main highlight of the year, the Killyleagh VE  celebrations, had to be cancelled in May by the Killyleagh Remembers the War group in the wake of the Coronavirus alert and the danger of public gatherings.The Killyleagh group has now cancelled its next proposed event, a lecture on the Second World War in the library due to be given by author George Busby on September .ldquoWe will be keeping under review the remaining schedule of the programme, in conjunction with the Heritage Lottery Fund.

Itrsquos never too early to encourage a love of physical activity in children.Briacuted is passionate about the benefits of dance for young children. ldquoDance is wonderful for coordination. It develops strength and endurance. Through dancing, a toddler will learn from the early age about what their bodies are capable of, she says.ldquo At the same time, it will build their curiosity as naturally they will experiment with certain movements. If toddlers have been introduced to dancing since early age, the chance of them developing good kinesthetic memory is increased.ldquoDuring class we work on key skills such as counting and sequencing thus subtlety engaging with numeracy and literacy. We incorporate sensory props such as ribbons, scarfs, feathers, bubbles and each dancer brings their own favourite toy to dance with. We introduce the foundations of Irish dance and enjoy watching a potential le long journey of dance begin.Following the Tapping Tots class, some  dancers attended the studio for an Irish dance camp with a dference.

This time Ardal McMahon provided the finish as they reached the water break.The RGU management team were left with plenty to ponder. Downpatrick continued to battle after the resumption, determined not to be hit by the threat of an avalanche of Rostrevor scores.At this stage there looked to be a real danger that Rostrevor would cut loose. To their credit, Downpatrick did not throw in the towel.Caolan Mooney burst through on the Downpatrick goal not long before half-time and a penalty was awardedwhen he was up-ended by goalkeeper Deeny. Shaun Parr stepped up and netted Rostrevorrsquos third goal.Downpatrick were given a glimmer of hope just before the interval when Parr and then Sean Cooper were black-carded.However at half-time, and the score at - to -, Downpatrickrsquos task looked onerous.The RGU came out with the right attitude to mount a revival in the second half and Doylersquos early minor reduced the gap.Chris Magee helped lead the Downpatrick forward linersquos continuing assaults on the Rostrevor goal with a couple of scores. And there emerged a real feeling of optimism amongst the massed Downpatrick ranks when Conor McGradyrsquos point left just two in it.However Rostrevor refused to hit the panic button. Guided by the experience of Mooney, they stretched their lead before the next water break.Downpatrick were awarded a penalty with the scoreboard reading - to -. However when Rostrevor needed a big moment at just the right time, goalkeeper Gareth Clarke provided it, plunging to push Tim Prenterrsquos effort to safety.That was the moment which really deflated Downpatrickrsquos resolve. You sensed that Rostrevor knew they had weathered the best that Downpatrick could summon in response to their deficit.Jordan Fegan then broke away in the closing minutes, before splitting the posts and taking Rostrevorrsquos score to -.Kane applied a classy coup de grace with the final score of the evening for the victors when he spun the Downpatrick defence and, bearing down on goal, took the safe option of landing the point.In the end it looked plain sailing on paper for Rostrevor. Certainly in terms of the opening they made to the match, catching the RGU cold, they laid the foundations early that kept many of the worries away that Downpatrick could spring a result on them.To Downpatrickrsquos credit, after that disappointing early start, there were more than enough signs there that the spirit within the camp to dig in and get themselves out of trouble in games is there.Downpatrick: James Deeny, Paddy Smith, Ronan Murphy, Eoin Rooney, Nathan McShane, Gerdie Collins, Conor Doherty, Damian Turley, Jonny Bell, Tim Prenter , Conor McGrady , Conor McCarron , Ruairi Quinn , Peter Turley , Chris Magee .Subs: Jarlath Brannigan , Morgan Fitzpatrick, Caolan Boyd, Damian Branf, Daniel McCarron, Garrett Trainor, Ruairi Og Quinn, Frank Starkey, Tom Savage, Tim Collins, Aidan McNeill, Con Farrell, Aidan Og Robinson.Rostrevor: Gareth Clarke, Jarlath Farrell, Tomas Gordon, Eoin Murdock, Nicky Murray, Colm Murney, James Donaghy, Sean Cooper, Caolan Mooney , Ardghal McMahon , Jordan Fegan , Patrick Magee, Conor Doyle , Shaun Parr, Piaras Kane .Subs: Paul McGrath, Richie Reynolds, Darren McElhinney, Conall Gordon, Eamon McConville.

Baraclough did not expect that his announcement would be tarnished by the decision of one of Northern Ireland’s emerging players, Mark Sykes, to switch allegiance to the Republic of Ireland.The midfielder, who plays in the third tier of English football for Oxford United, was previously involved in three international squads, but had not yet made a first team appearance.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Owen PolleySykes’ decision is particularly galling for the Irish FA, which runs Northern Ireland football, because he was a product of the association’s youth teams.He represented his country at multiple levels, even when he plied his trade in the Irish League, taking advantage of the IFA’s Club NI system for developing elite players. One of Michael O’Neill’s achievements was that he seemed to have stemmed the flow of footballers defecting to the Republic. Partly, that was due to the success of his team, which qualied for the European Championship in  and then twice made the play-offs for major tournaments. However, O’Neill’s formidable powers of persuasion were also a major factor.He took care to talk to young players who were at risk of being poached by the southern football authorities.In  he addressed rumours that QPR forward Paul Smyth had been approached by the Football Association of Ireland.The FAI pursue “one type of player: Catholic,” O’Neill alleged.“You could argue that’s sectarian in terms of... recruitment.”As an example he cited Northern Ireland’s midfielder, Paddy McNair.“The FAI thought he must be a Catholic, and when they found out he was a Protestant, they stayed away from it.”Under FIFA’s rules, any player who is eligible for Northern Ireland is also entitled to play for the Republic, unless they have already played competitively for the first-team.In the south, and among many northern nationalists, this is viewed as a right underpinned by citizenship and identity. Northern Ireland fans believe it puts their team at a disadvantage that may be unique in world football. When the IFA challenged the Republic’s interpretation of the rules at the Court of Arbitration of Sport , they lost their case, on the basis that the player in question, Daniel Kearns, was a dual national.His Irish citizenship entitled him to represent the Republic and he qualied for Northern Ireland because, just like the majority of people who are born here, he held automatic British citizenship.Ironically, the rules that enable the FAI to select Northern Irish players rest on an interpretation of British citizenship law that nationalist parties are campaigning to change. Regardless of these details, FIFA has shown consistently that it will not address Northern Ireland’s grievance. Footballers from Northern Ireland will remain eligible to play for the Republic for the foreseeable future.Effectively, the IFA has accepted this regrettable situation and has decided to manage it as best it can. It will continue to make its setup attractive, welcoming and representative of the whole of Northern Ireland, in contrast to the Republic’s selection strategy, which threatens to build a form of football apartheid on the island. The IFA, though, might find its arguments gain more traction when it comes to players switching allegiance after they have played for international youth teams.Ian Baraclough expressed justiable frustration that resources that could have been used to nurture another talented youngster were wasted on Sykes.“He may just have taken that opportunity away ,” the manager noted. Unlike the eligibility situation, this problem isn’t unique to Northern Ireland either. Appropriately, the Republic had its own high-profile defector, Declan Rice, who decided to play for England, after taking advantage of the Irish youth system.The media are now speculating about the future of Liverpool’s Welsh defender, Neco Williams, who is still eligible to switch to England.To prevent international football becoming a farce, FIFA could change its rules so that players are tied to their country after they compete for its under- team.At the very least, when young footballers change their allegiance at this late stage, the association that developed them should be entitled to some compensation.Unfortunately, the authorities that run football are rarely drawn in the direction of good sense. Rather than tightening up its rules, FIFA is discussing allowing players to play three senior competitive games for their country, before they’re prevented from switching to another team. At the moment, they are tied to an association after one competitive first-team game.If anything, it looks like the integrity of international football is likely to be degraded further, and Ian Baraclough’s job will only become harder.– Owen Polley is a unionist writer and commentatorRamore restaurant row: Stephen Nolan wondershealth workers effectively banned from all restaurantsEARLIER THIS SUMMER:Gerry Adams declares Bobby Storey a ‘selfless’ and ‘gentle’ man as large crowd gathers for funeralBlack Lives Matter advocate says DUP MP ‘must recognise his role in an overall system of anti-black oppression’________________________A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

 years onMr Evans, of Cardigan in West Wales, but now living in Brecon, said: ldquoIrsquod taken a call back in  to check my availability for a small comedy for BBC Three and set in South Wales.ldquoI met up with Christine Gernonand Ruth Jonesat the Castell Mynach pub near Llantrisant one afternoon to discuss the script and the locations they wanted me to scout.ldquoAn hour or so after the meeting, I got the call from the production company Baby Cow offering me the job.ldquoMy first task was to sit with Dave Ferrisand discuss the vision for Gavin  Staceyrsquos backdrop and get a feel for the key locations.ldquoStaceyrsquos hometown was scripted as a South Wales coastal town, but I was given a free run on this so the hunt took me to Aberavon, Porthcawl, Tenby, Saundersfoot, and Weston-super-Mare - a cheatit had been suitable.ldquoBack in  there were a few areas in Barry which were beginning to look a little tired, but it also came with a timeless charm that provided us with the perfect texture and feel that Dave and I had discussed.ldquoAdded to this was the welcome we were given by residents and, in particular, the support of the local council.ldquoPorthcawl was also a serious candidate for the backdrop to this show, but having scouted tirelessly the whole of Barry and Barry Island, I knew that this ticked every box.Mr Evans said Trinity Street was an instant favourite.ldquoI knew Gwenrsquos house was here, he said. ldquoThe terraced houses on a steep hill and its far-reaching views over to Barry Island and docks meant that no matter which direction the camera was pointing, there would be interesting textures and views.ldquoThe next objective was to get inside as many houses as possible to seeany worked for us as Gwenrsquos house.ldquoI letter dropped about  houses to gauge the interest.ldquoIrsquod heard that Matt Lucas was going to be involved so I used his name get to my foot in the door.ldquoThis usually helps.ldquoIn those days very few had heard of James Corden.ldquoI viewed and took pictures of about five houses on that street and Glendarsquos who was one of the first to contact me.ldquoThe decor and character of Glendarsquos house fitted my brief perfectly, but my first thought was that house was a little on the small side.ldquoTo get a film crew and the actors to work in such a tight space would be quite a challenge, butI could convince our director and designer that it could be achieved Gwenrsquos house was found.ldquoI took Dave and Christine along to Trinity Street and both fell in love with the location within minutes.Mr Evans continued: ldquoGlenda was so accommodating.ldquoI remember very well discussing with her the details of how filming on location works, how disruptive the whole process can be and also the location fee.ldquoWhat I do remember was her reaction when I mentioned the amount.ldquoGlendarsquos reply was: ldquoIrsquom so sorry Clive, but I donrsquot think I can cover that.ldquoGlenda thought that she needed to pay for the privilege of having us there and not the other way round.ldquoShe is a lovely lady and still loves being a part of the Gavin  Stacey world.During the locationsrsquo breakdown meeting, we discussed how Pam and Mickrsquos house might look in Billericay so homes were viewed in and around Llandaff and Sully until Dinas Powys was selected thanks to the welcome that was received.ldquoSt Cattwgrsquos Church at Llanmaes was not the first-choice wedding venue for Gavin and Stacey, Mr Evans said. ldquoThey were due to be married at St Nicholas Church at the village of St Nicholas, but a last-minute change of heart by the Church in Wales meant that we needed to find an alternative at the th hour.ldquoA friend and another locations manager called Chris Hill pulled in a favour and we were able to use St Cattwgrsquos.ldquoI dont recall any candidates other than Island Leisure .ldquoWhile filming on the front, Marco opening up early for the crew to be able to get a nice coffee as the weather was pretty unkind.ldquoWe didnt use the interior of the coffee shop as a location in series one, but as it was so cold when we filmed on the seafront the coffees were very welcome.ldquoWe also filmed at the Vale of Glamorgan Resort for the exterior of the wedding fair.ldquoThe interior was shot at the Copthorne Hotel at Culverhouse Cross.ldquoWhile at the Vale resort, the Wales rugby team came into the reception of the hotel.ldquoRuth Jones askedIrsquod be able to set up a photograph of the cast with the Welsh team.ldquoWe got them to agree so out there somewhere are pictures of the Gavin  Stacey cast with the Wales rugby team.ldquoUncle Brynrsquos house was only an exterior in series one so very little was involved in its search.ldquoQuiz night at the Colcot Arms was interesting.ldquoWe were close to completing our filming when the pub opened to the public - so the last few shots took a little while longer than wersquod planned.Mr Evans lives with his we Rhiannon and daughter Cerys Mim and runs his own Film and TV Facilities company.He added: ldquoThe actors usually donrsquot get to see the locations beforehand.ldquoThey are brought to set, run through a quick rehearsal then go for the real thing.ldquoThey then have to go through the whole thing over and over with the camera shooting from dferent angles.ldquoIt is a slow process and  hours on camera gives us around three minutes of footage.ldquoI get a real buzz from seeing locations that I have found on TV, but when it comes to Gavin  Stacey the story I always bring up is that while scouting in the very early days with the series producer in the car he askedI would consider reading for Dave.ldquoMy le could have been so dferent, but I have no regrets as no-one could have played it better than Steffan Rhodri.ldquoMy daughter Cerys Mim was born during filming and James Corden was the first to congratulate me when I ed to work on the show after her birth.ldquoHe joked about us naming her Nessa or Stacey.ldquoBarry and the Vale have always provided me with a fantastic hunting ground for film and TV locations.ldquoIts a huge contributor to South Wales becoming a hotspot for filming in the last decade or so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That is unfair. “I have raised this with the Minister and asked her to urgently review this decision and to quickly reinstate these test.I have requested a meeting with her so that the instructors can highlight their concerns.”Sinn Féin MLA John O’Dowd called for the opening of temporary driving test facility in Craigavon while the normal center is used for Covid  testing.Mr O’Dowd said: “While I welcome the commencement of Driving Tests across the North I have to express my disappoint they will not be recommencing in Craigavon. I understand the use of the current center for Covid  testing rules out this facility however other facilities could be used to keep tests in the Craigavon area.“I have written to Minister Mallon and asked for other options to be explored and another venue identied to allow learner drivers to complete their tests.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
