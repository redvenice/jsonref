According to a fansite, he watched an episode of the series being filmed along with an episode of Charlie\u0027s Angels          The Prince of Wales is also pictured in the archive meeting other actresses and actors in Hollywood in 1977 - three years before he first started courting Diana.

It was the monarch\u0027s first visit to an eastern bloc country and she was greeted by President Josip Tito in full military uniform. She went on the state visit with husband Prince Philip and daughter Princess Anne and returned the favour when she invited Tito to Buckingham Palace in 1978          President Tito, pictured during The Queen\u0027s state visit to Yugoslavia in 1972, pulled out all the stops to make the trip a memorable one including raising the Union Jack flag. A former communist revolutionary, Tito led a successful resistance group against the Nazis during World War Two and became prime minister of his country in 1944, before becoming its first president in 1953. It is said on his return visit to London he impressed the royals by playing Chopin on the piano          A candid snap of Andrew and Edward from the 1970\u0027s. Auctioneer David Lay, who is selling the archive, said: \u0027During my many years as an auctioneer we have handled quite a few photographic collections but this is undoubtedly one of the most remarkable archives I have ever seen. In the UK and indeed many other parts of the world, the fascination with the British Royals is unwavering and here we have an archive that documents four decades of their lives\u0027          A smiling Queen at Balmoral in the early 1950\u0027s. Auctioneer Mr Lay added: \u0027The breadth and quality of the images is superb so really it is unparalleled in my experience. Looking through all the images in this archive, covering almost 40 years, it is possible to see the Royal family grow up before ones eyes. Everything is here, from childhood to maturity, diplomatic Royal engagements with all their pomp and ceremony to unguarded family moments between the Queen and her children. It is an astonishing collection of images\u0027          Princess Margaret with Lord Snowdon and Prince Andrew.A remarkable archive of over 4,000 photos of the Royals taken over four decades by a trusted photographer has emerged for sale for £10,000.The photos include iconic snaps of Prince Charles and Princess Diana on honeymoon as well as intimate shots of the Queen and other prominent Royals relaxing  A very young Katharine Worsely, the Duchess of Kent. The Duchess, now 85, met Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, the eldest son of Prince George, Duke of Kent, and Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, while he was based at Catterick Camp.  On June 8 1961, the couple married at York Minster and Princess Anne was one of the bridesmaids. Guests included actors Noël Coward and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as well as members of the British, Greek, Danish, Norwegian, Yugoslavian, Romanian and Spanish royal families. The Duchess later gained attention for her conversion to Catholicism in 1994, the first member of the Royal Family to convert publicly since the passing of the Act of Settlement 1701          Role reversal: The Queen is pictured snapping away on her camera while in the countryside with her family. She often used a German designed Leica to take her snaps and was regularly photographed taking pictures of horse events          A young Prince Charles on the Royal yacht Bloodhound in Scotland. The classic 1930s yacht, which was owned by Her Majesty and Prince Philip from 1962 to 1969, was where Charles and his sister Anne learned how to sail. Prince Philip had much success competing with her at the famous Cowes Week Regatta around the Isle of Wight, and she was also used to take the entire family, along with the Britannia, to Scotland\u0027s Western Isles for their annual holiday          The Royals have many interests and this photo of Prince Charles and sister Princess Anne from the early 1960s shows they grew up with a keen interest in boats. The pair are pictured on a rubber speedboat, with Charles appearing to be tinkering with the engine while Anne retrieves an oar to manually move the vessel          Princess Margaret\u0027s relationship with her husband eventually became strained and they are pictured here deep in conversation, with both looking concerned. The marriage broke down in 1976 after Margaret was pictured on the front page of a national newspaper with younger lover Sir Roddy Llewellyn, 17 years her junior, and they were orced two years later          A young Princess Anne is pictured in a casual moment chatting to a member of the public while dressed in what appears to be a 1970s style, wearing a cravat and jeans. The photo was taken around the time of a kidnapping attempt on the Princess in which Ian Ball stopped her limousine and shot her protection officer in a failed £2million ransom plot          Just like recent events with the birth of Prince Louis, a new royal baby was a major event for the media. Here Princess Margaret, right, and her husband Lord Snowden, left, are pictured taking their newborn son David home after his birth in November 1961. The Princess had two children with her husband, a photographer previously known as Antony Armstrong-Jones before he was given a title          A young Prince Edward and his cousin Sarah Armstrong Jones, daughter of Princess Margaret, are pictured here playing together at a horse show in the late 1960s. The candid series of photographs show the Royal Family at some of their most relaxed moments and reveals how their children were just like any other, particularly in this image where the prince appears to be trying to protect his hair from his cousin          This series of snaps taken of Princess Diana were commissioned for a set of stamps issued on her 21st birthday, a year after she married Prince Charles. Her expression looks somewhat uncomfortable and possibly reflects her feelings within the Royal Family, with problems quickly surfacing in her marriage to Charles, which would end in orce after 15 years          The Queen, right, and her sister Princess Margaret, left, pictured together in the 1970s. Reflecting how they have often been portrayed in the media, the monarch looks stern and serious while Margaret has a more relaxed expression. The pair are believed to be pictured at a horse show, which they grew up attending together          The Queen is pictured by Mr Scott here at one of her favourite events, the Badminton Horse Trials, in 1952. She even moved the trials to Windsor for one year in 1955 so they could also stage the second European Championships. The car parks, tradestands, arena and cross country courses fit into an area of approximately 500 acres of Badminton Park          Scott (pictured) lived an extraordinary life himself as he was a Yugoslavian aristocrat who fled his native Serbia during the Second World War after it was occupied by the Nazis. His actual name was Colonel Vassa Voynovich and he commanded a platoon on the Russian front aged just 17 during the First World War. An ex-cavalry officer with equestrian expertise, he was at home capturing Ascot, Badminton and the Windsor Horse Show, and shared the Royals\u0027 passion for horses. He was also extremely charming, spoke 10 languages and his diplomatic experience meant he was suave and comfortable around royalty          Prince Charles and Princess Diana do not look much like a happy couple here pictured on a trip to Wales in the early 1980s. Although the couple\u0027s marriage initially seemed strong, problems began to develop after five years and both had affairs, with Charles seeing his now wife Camilla, leading to Diana saying there were \u0027three people in the marriage\u0027 a decade later  Princess Diana looks a lot happier in these photos, including an iconic shot with Charles  as they walked around Balmoral on their honeymoon in 1981, left, when she was just 20 years old, and alongside the Duchess of York, who also endured her own difficulties with the Royals, at the Guard\u0027s Polo Club, Egham in 1982           Charles is pictured dancing with scantily clad women at a carnival in Brazil surrounded by a mass of press, more dancers in elaborate gold coloured clothing and a huddle of happy revellers. Draped in a smart double breasted tuxedo with large bow-tie, Charles cut a dashing figure with his hair swept over in a side parting style, which has, ironically, become fashionable again and was worn similarly by many male attendees at his son Prince Harry\u0027s recent wedding to Meghan Markle          Saintly smile: Sharing a laugh with Mother Theresa in Calcutta in 1978, Charles donned a red rose in his lapel and a smart grey day suit with matching neck tie. Years later Princess Diana would have a spiritual awakening at the hands of Mother Theresa and write, in a letter to her confidant Paul Burrell: \u0027Today, something very profound touched my life.

A Tube strike will be taking place from 12:01am on Thursday, June 14, 2018 and will last until 11:59pm. Jubilee line strikeWhile the Jubilee line is the only Tube service that will be suspended for the entire day, the Bakerloo and Metropolitan lines in north-west London are also expected to be busy, because commuters will be using these lines as an alternative mode of transport.Some Metropolitan services that call at Baker Street will also call at Willesden Green, however. Stations such as Stratford, West Ham, South Hampstead, West Hampstead Thameslink and Hendon are expected to be busier than usual.The rest of the London Tube network is expected to operate as normal, with no other planned closures announced for the day. TfL will be running extra buses in order to cope with the additional passengers using this mode of transport.          With the Jubilee line being suspended, other lines are expected to be extremely busyWhy is there a strike?Jubilee line staff from both RMT and Aslef unions will stage a walkout on June 14 in a row over a new timetable, that has been imposed by TfL.This new timetable has been introduced so that peak service is extended on the busiest sections of the line by an hour, which will benefit thousands of passengers.However, the unions fear for how the new timetable will impact the work-life balance of the drivers, as it will ‘ride roughshod over current rostering agreements’, the RMT said. With the number of drivers working on Saturdays, a previous arrangement agreed upon in 2015, would be broken.Is the Tube strike really going to happen?Despite efforts to try and reach an agreement with the conciliation service Acas, the strike in June looks like it will go ahead.RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ‘RMT is bitterly disappointed that Tube managers have knocked back an opportunity to negotiate a settlement to this dispute in extensive talks that broke up on Friday. They failed to put a single proposal forward.          Despite efforts to reach an agreement, the strikes on both days in June 2018 will go ahead‘It is outrageous that Tube managers are trying to bulldoze through timetable changes without agreement that ride roughshod over existing rostering agreements.‘Drivers are angry at the impact on work-life balance and rightly see this move as the thin end of a very long wedge that could see processes and agreements unilaterally shredded by Tube bosses.TfL’s Director of Network Operations for London Underground, Nigel Holness added: ‘We have adhered to the strict agreements and policies we have with our trade unions. This action is completely unnecessary and I apologise to customers for the disruption that it will cause.‘I call on the unions to continue working with us for the benefit of our customers and our staff and to call off these strikes.’NBA 2K19: All you need to knowLogie Awards 2018: All you need to knowSoccer Aid 2018 teams: Robbie Williams and Usain Bolt lineups revealedEuroMillions results: National lottery winning numbers for Tuesday, 5th June 2018 drawLaura Prepon\u0027s net worth revealed after OINTB star\u0027s wedding to Ben FosterTransformers Bumblebee movie trailer, cast and plot revealedRed Dead Redemption 2 release date, trailer, editions and pre-orderState of Origin 2018: All you need to knowMagic Mike Live in London: All you need to knowE3 2018: All you need to know about the Electronic Entertainment ExpoTfL Tube strike: All you need to know about the Jubilee line walkoutWho is Chief Keef?

Ninewells Hospital in Dundee where the woman, 30, went to have her baby delivered when she went into premature labour\u0027Further, the Tribunal found that she embarked upon a vaginal delivery without a proper basis for concluding that a delivery was imminent or that there were any characteristics present that might be regarded as favourable to a vaginal delivery.\u0027The Tribunal did not accept that in these circumstances a caesarean section was the appropriate mode of delivery for foetal wellbeing. The Tribunal did not accept that the circumstances were such that Dr Laxman should have assumed that a caesarean section would have no prospect of success.\u0027The Tribunal determined that at this time Dr Laxman\u0027s priority was a live delivery and there was also a reasonable prospect that Baby B could have survived following an immediate caesarean section under general anaesthetic.\u0027The decision to proceed with vaginal delivery represented a failure in her clinical decision-making on the evidence available to her at the time.\u0027In today\u0027s tribunal decision, the panel added: \u0027The tribunal is satisfied that Dr Vilvanathan Laxman has expressed genuine and appropriate remorse for what happened, and she candidly accepted responsibility as the consultant in charge in theatre that day. \u0027The events in question are likely to have had a profound impact on Dr Laxman, as they surely will have for all others who were present in theatre that day. She has learnt from this unfortunate episode and that the likelihood of it being repeated is extremely remote. \u0027Further, at no point has Dr Vilvanathan Laxman sought to blame others for what happened or to minimise her actions.\u0027It was ruled that Dr Laxman should not receive a formal warning over the case and an interim order on her medical registration has now been revoked.The report said: \u0027In all the circumstances, the tribunal has concluded that Dr Vilvanathan Laxman\u0027s conduct did not fall so far short of the standards of conduct reasonably to be expected of a doctor as to amount to serious misconduct.\u0027In respect of patient safety, the tribunal was satisfied that Dr Vilvanathan Laxman does not currently present a risk to patients.\u0027Dr Vilvanathan Laxman\u0027s wrong decision related to an isolated, single incident in an otherwise unblemished career.\u0027The panel concluded: \u0027Nothing in this determination should detract from the fact that on March 16 2014 Dr Vilvanathan Laxman made a significant error of judgement which had serious consequences and a profound impact upon patient A and for which Dr Vilvanathan Laxman bears a heavy responsibility.\u0027 The tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee with a team of other doctors.The woman\u0027s waters had broken early at 25 weeks and upon examination her unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, was in a breech position whilst the mother\u0027s cervix was between 2-4cm dilated. It can be 10cm fully dilated and the patient was told by doctors she might have to undergo a C-section.Laxman had started work at 8.30am the previous day and went home at 6pm for five hours before returning to the hospital at 11pm. She was told about the patient at 2am and was subsequently paged at 8.30am to take a look at her when her condition became more critical.Later, whilst discussing the method of delivery, Laxman told a colleague: \u0027We are not doing a C-section - you would never do a C-section of a 25-weeker.\u0027 She then carried out a vaginal examination of the woman and told her \u0027to push.\u0027Mr Bradbury added: \u0027Initially the body of Baby B descended without difficulty however, the arms were raised and the hands were behind the head which required manipulation by Dr Laxman for their delivery.\u0027Thereafter, Baby B\u0027s head became trapped in the uterus with his neck within Patient A\u0027s cervix.\u0027There then followed what was to become, in the Tribunal\u0027s view, an increasingly desperate attempt to deliver Baby B\u0027s head. \u0027Because of the pain and distress that Patient A was by this time experiencing the decision was made to administer a general anaesthetic following which further attempts were made to incise Patient A\u0027s cervix and extract Baby B by means of traction.\u0027While Patient A was under general anaesthetic, Dr Laxman continued to make attempts to deliver Baby B by traction and ultimately Baby B\u0027s head became detached from his body. \u0027The evidence suggests, and the Tribunal accepts, that by the time that Baby B\u0027s head became detached from his body he had already died.\u0027Even on her own initial assessment that Patient A\u0027s cervix was 4cm dilated this should have indicated to Dr Laxman that this was insufficient to deliver Baby B\u0027s head.\u0027She should have appreciated that there would be a real and significant risk of complications arising during delivery, namely head entrapment, having had regard to the likely diameter of the baby\u0027s head at this gestation.\u0027Dr Laxman made a decision which was not clinically indicated, in that she failed to perform an immediate delivery by caesarean section under general anaesthetic and instead proceeded with a vaginal delivery.\u0027Her conduct set in train a course of events which ultimately resulted in the decapitation of Baby B and to this extent contributed to that decapitation. \u0027But for Dr Laxman\u0027s error of judgement in this regard, the decapitation would not have occurred.\u0027Laxman will now face further disciplinary hearings which will decide whether she could be struck off.She told the hearing: \u0027I was trying to deliver a live baby, I was trying really hard, possibly too hard. \u0027I did not intend to harm mum or the baby. I am distraught at the outcome and I am very sorry it did not come out the way I meant it.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/19/4CF1F7BD00000578-5809377-image-m-4_1528223340106.jpg","title":"Kenneth Cole deletes tone deaf tweet calling Kate Spade inspiring accessory","story":"    Kenneth Cole wrote then deleted this tweet on Tuesday morning after news of Kate Spade\u0027s death emerged           Spade and Cole are pictured in 2002 at an event in New York City.

But the same average poor inidual spent £15,829.One in five \u0027living in poverty\u0027 in Britain: Up to 14 MILLION...UK has one of the lowest \u0027persistent poverty\u0027 rates in EU,...Share this articleThe report pointed to the plight of people who are living not only on low incomes but whose spending is less than 60 per cent of average household spending. ‘Those who are in poverty on both measures are worse off than those experiencing poverty on a single dimension,’ it said.Poverty figures are worked out from ONS income surveys, but yesterday’s report said ‘consumption expenditure is thought to be a better measure of achieved living standards’, and examined surveys of family spending.It found that the tenth of the population who said they have the lowest incomes declared they had on average £5,000 to live on, including all state benefits, in the financial year that ended in March 2017. But the same people on average spent £12,800 in the same period on food, drink, clothes, transport, household goods and other outgoings.          The commonly used poverty line marks anyone as poor if they are living on less than 60 per cent of average incomeONS researchers said some people may not be disclosing their full income when surveys are conducted. ‘Certain types of benefits tend to be under-reported,’ they added.It was also noted that ‘people towards the bottom of the income distribution often have multiple income sources, which makes measurement error harder to avoid’.The figures, which did not include housing costs, were based on the Family Resources Survey, which asks people in 19,000 homes about their income each year, and the Living Costs and Food Survey, which records the annual spending of 6,000 homes.Yesterday academic and researcher into the family Patricia Morgan said: ‘A large number of people are working unofficially and are unlikely to declare their incomes. There are many single mothers who are in fact supported by partners, but will be reluctant to discuss it because they wish to keep their benefits.‘All this is ignored by the poverty lobby. Spreading the idea there are very high levels of poverty is their business.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/07/4CF608A600000578-5811187-image-m-3_1528268015655.jpg","title":"Samantha Cameron reveals didnt enjoy time No 10","story":"    Samantha Cameron has revealed she hated public waving during her time in Downing Street.

They pulled up to his car as it was stopped by the side of the road near to some traff­ic lights, which were green.\u0027They smashed the window which clearly startled Michael as it would anyone — then he jumped out the passenger’s side and they followed him round.The witness added: \u0027People who saw it were shocked too. No one went to help when it was happening, but it happened so fast, they were gone in seconds. They had hammers and I’m sure I saw one of them with a big knife.\u0027  In a chilling illustration of the moped gang crisis, a young woman was fighting for her life last night after her mobile was snatched by moped-riding thieves. And a motorcycle gang targeted yet another luxury store in London yesterday with pedestrians forced to try to tackle them, wrestling one suspect to the ground.Campaigners and politicians warned the attacks were matched by disturbing rises in stabbings, drug crime and gang violence.London now has a higher murder rate than New York, with more than 70 killings so far this year. Knife crime has also led to the deaths of a 17-year-old boy in Ipswich and of 15-year-olds in Sheffield and Wolverhampton.After an extraordinary day of violence, including the attack on Michael McIntyre, it emerged: Scotland Yard has logged 22,025 motorcycle muggings in 12 months – a rise of 50 per centOfficers revealed that city gangs had set up 650 ‘county line’ networks to sell drugs in towns and villages Police were hunting moped robbers who targeted comedian Michael McIntyre A rank-and-file police leader said officers were wary of chasing them for fear of possible disciplinary action A think-tank said shop theft cost £6.3billion last year – or £270 for every household.David Green, of the Civitas think-tank, said: ‘A fall in police numbers combined with increasingly violent drug gangs has meant some parts of our cities resemble TV’s The Wire. Violent crime is rising and knife crime is rising as gangs fight over drug territories.’Experts believe a booming illicit drugs market – notably in crack cocaine – is fuelling much of the violence. They have also highlighted the middle-class appetite for regular cocaine.The Metropolitan Police figures showed that crimes committed using mopeds, scooters and motorcycles soared by 50 per cent in the year to May, to 22,025.               As the thugs fled, the 42-year-old rushed round to the passenger side of the vehicle to comfort his son (pictured), who is understood to have been in the car at the time of the attackMr McIntyre, 42, who is worth £38million, was waiting outside a school in northLondon, when he was robbed at around 2pm on Monday.Police are investigating whether the moped gang followed him from his £5.7million Hampstead mansion with the aim of grabbing his Rolex or if he was the victim of a random attack because he was driving a luxury car in a wealthy London suburb. The father-of-two was picking up Oscar, 10, who with his brother Lucas, 13, are the source of a lot of his material in his much-loved stand-up routines. Speaking after the incident, Mr McIntyre said: \u0027I can\u0027t really say what\u0027s happening, we\u0027re in the process of sorting this out. There\u0027s been an incident and we\u0027re dealing with it.\u0027I need to find out the best thing to do here, I can\u0027t say anything. This is not a wind up, it\u0027s ongoing and I can\u0027t share the details.\u0027 Journalist Jane Moore, who is married to the comic\u0027s agent Gary Farrow, believes Michael may have been targeted as soon as his son was in the car knowing the star would not risk them harming him.She told ITV\u0027s Loose Women: \u0027How terrifying - his 10-year-old son is in the front seat of the car, and this guy pulls up alongside and he\u0027s got a hammer. To smash a window like that it takes about 10 or 15 goes. Can you imagine how terrified?\u0027They probably targeted him because he had a child in his car, because as a parent you\u0027re not going to take anybody on, you\u0027re going to say, \u0027have whatever you want, don\u0027t hurt me or my child\u0027\u0027,She added: \u0027Somebody please do something about these gangs\u0027 while fellow panelist Anna Richardson said father and son should seek counsellling and revealed she had needed help after she was robbed in a hotel room in 2016. Mr McIntyre was in the Range Rover with his ten-year-old son  in the front passenger seat, one witness told the Mail. They originally claimed the star fell out of the driver\u0027s side and appeared to try to fight off the robbers during the 30-second attack.He then rushed round to the passenger side of the vehicle to comfort his shaken up son and give him a hug.A friend said today Michael, who is currently on the UK leg of his Big World Tour, is \u0027very shaken by the whole experience\u0027 but was uninjured. The moped gang dressed head-to-toe in black pulled up next to him and smashed their way into his car and demanded his Rolex before they sped away.Mr McIntyre\u0027s wife Kitty was reportedly seen close to the damaged car in \u0027floods of tears\u0027 as police spoke to her husband. Today she left the £5.7million family home  and told reporters her husband was \u0027fine\u0027.  Parents on the school run rushed to comfort the shocked star  and he looked shell-shocked and was heard saying: \u0027I need to find out the best thing to do here\u0027.It\u0027s not known if the comedian was targeted or his £120,000 Range Rover was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.             The robbers used hammers to destroy the driver\u0027s window and demanded his silver watch, worth around £15,000            A serious looking Kitty McIntyre, wife of Michael McIntyre, was photographed leaving the family home in North  London yesterday and said her husband is \u0027fine\u0027      Former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan, left, had a £100,000 watch stolen after an armed moped rider stopped his Maserati in Croydon earlier this year. Ex Made in Chelsea star Ashley James, pictured right, was targeted by moped thieves for her phone in MarchMoped riders also stole a £100,000 Franck Muller watch from former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan when he stopped in his Maserati in Croydon.The rider appeared to produce a gun and threatened the businessman through the window.Mr Jordan said his 80-year-old father was also in the car and was \u0027trying to have a pop at the gunman\u0027.A 32-year-old man was arrested and charged over the offence last month. Ex Made in Chelsea star Ashley James was also targetted in March after two moped riders stole her phone near Kilburn station.The 30-year-old model former Celebrity Big Brother star revealed she chased down the thieves and got the phone back after tackling them.She added it was the second time such an incident had happened to her after having her handbag stolen in Barcelona.And Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe rushed to the aid of a tourist slashed in the face by a moped rider last July.The victim was targeted for a Louis Vuitton bag and Radcliffe, 27, rushed over to tend to him after the offenders sped away.

Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe rushed to the aid of a tourist slashed in the face by a moped rider last July                        Kitty McIntyre left their £5.7million north London mansion at 8.20am on Tuesday morning and drove their eldest son Lucas, 13, to school. Oscar, ten, who is believed to have witnessed the attack was not with her.She returned to their six bedroom home and parked their silver-grey Range Rover sport courtesy car in the driveway.When asked if they were worried for their family\u0027s safety, the aromatherapist said: \u0027No, no. He\u0027s fine.\u0027The three-storey mansion, with a green door, had every blind and curtain drawn.It is not known if Michael, who is one of the most successful comedians of all time, is at home.His Range Rover, with the shattered window, was not outside his home. Moped crime has been described as being \u0027out of control\u0027 in London with 23,000 offences last year - up from 827 reported incidents in 2012. Gangs all over the capital have been trying to rip valuables such as phones and jewellery from drivers and pedestrians including millionaire Simon Jordan, whose £127,000 watch was taken at gunpoint as he sat in his Masarati in March.George Osborne almost had his phone ripped from his hand outside the BBC in May last year and Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe ran to the aid of a tourist who was attacked in Fulham. Michael McIntyre had been sitting outside the  school when two masked riders brandishing hammers pulled up next to him.They then smashed through his driver\u0027s window and stole his watch. It is not known if they took other items like his wallet and phone. One witness said: \u0027The guy at the front of the moped started to hit the driver\u0027s window about ten to 15 times and it eventually just cracked. He opens the door and gets Michael McIntyre out of the car. Michael fell but he was still trying to put up a fight.\u0027I just remember one of the bikers trying to get something. I don\u0027t know what the guy was trying to get – a watch, a wallet, maybe?\u0027And then within seconds they were gone down the hill. It was all so quick – the whole thing must have taken 30 seconds\u0027.He added he thought that Michael\u0027s son was in the car with him and was hugged by his dad and school friends afterwards.             Mr Mcintyre was photographed looking shell-shocked by his £120,000 Range Rover after yesterday afternoon\u0027s attack            The millionaire comedian was sitting in his Range Rover at around 2pm yesterday when the thugs started trying to smash his window with a hammerAnother witness said: \u0027I was driving along the road when I saw two men dressed head to toe in black. One man was on the bike and the other was either attacking or fighting Michael McIntyre. There was shouting too.\u0027The driver\u0027s window of his Range Rover was completely smashed. The second guy jumped on the back of the motorbike and they got away\u0027.       1.

Akbar Al Baker (centre) later defended the carrier, saying it was the first Middle Eastern airline to have a female pilot and that other women were in senior roles.

Ninewells Hospital in Dundee where the woman, 30, went to have her baby delivered when she went into premature labour\u0027Further, the Tribunal found that she embarked upon a vaginal delivery without a proper basis for concluding that a delivery was imminent or that there were any characteristics present that might be regarded as favourable to a vaginal delivery.\u0027The Tribunal did not accept that in these circumstances a caesarean section was the appropriate mode of delivery for foetal wellbeing. The Tribunal did not accept that the circumstances were such that Dr Laxman should have assumed that a caesarean section would have no prospect of success.\u0027The Tribunal determined that at this time Dr Laxman\u0027s priority was a live delivery and there was also a reasonable prospect that Baby B could have survived following an immediate caesarean section under general anaesthetic.\u0027The decision to proceed with vaginal delivery represented a failure in her clinical decision-making on the evidence available to her at the time.\u0027In today\u0027s tribunal decision, the panel added: \u0027The tribunal is satisfied that Dr Vilvanathan Laxman has expressed genuine and appropriate remorse for what happened, and she candidly accepted responsibility as the consultant in charge in theatre that day. \u0027The events in question are likely to have had a profound impact on Dr Laxman, as they surely will have for all others who were present in theatre that day. She has learnt from this unfortunate episode and that the likelihood of it being repeated is extremely remote. \u0027Further, at no point has Dr Vilvanathan Laxman sought to blame others for what happened or to minimise her actions.\u0027It was ruled that Dr Laxman should not receive a formal warning over the case and an interim order on her medical registration has now been revoked.The report said: \u0027In all the circumstances, the tribunal has concluded that Dr Vilvanathan Laxman\u0027s conduct did not fall so far short of the standards of conduct reasonably to be expected of a doctor as to amount to serious misconduct.\u0027In respect of patient safety, the tribunal was satisfied that Dr Vilvanathan Laxman does not currently present a risk to patients.\u0027Dr Vilvanathan Laxman\u0027s wrong decision related to an isolated, single incident in an otherwise unblemished career.\u0027The panel concluded: \u0027Nothing in this determination should detract from the fact that on March 16 2014 Dr Vilvanathan Laxman made a significant error of judgement which had serious consequences and a profound impact upon patient A and for which Dr Vilvanathan Laxman bears a heavy responsibility.\u0027 The tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee with a team of other doctors.The woman\u0027s waters had broken early at 25 weeks and upon examination her unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, was in a breech position whilst the mother\u0027s cervix was between 2-4cm dilated. It can be 10cm fully dilated and the patient was told by doctors she might have to undergo a C-section.Laxman had started work at 8.30am the previous day and went home at 6pm for five hours before returning to the hospital at 11pm. She was told about the patient at 2am and was subsequently paged at 8.30am to take a look at her when her condition became more critical.Later, whilst discussing the method of delivery, Laxman told a colleague: \u0027We are not doing a C-section - you would never do a C-section of a 25-weeker.\u0027 She then carried out a vaginal examination of the woman and told her \u0027to push.\u0027Mr Bradbury added: \u0027Initially the body of Baby B descended without difficulty however, the arms were raised and the hands were behind the head which required manipulation by Dr Laxman for their delivery.\u0027Thereafter, Baby B\u0027s head became trapped in the uterus with his neck within Patient A\u0027s cervix.\u0027There then followed what was to become, in the Tribunal\u0027s view, an increasingly desperate attempt to deliver Baby B\u0027s head. \u0027Because of the pain and distress that Patient A was by this time experiencing the decision was made to administer a general anaesthetic following which further attempts were made to incise Patient A\u0027s cervix and extract Baby B by means of traction.\u0027While Patient A was under general anaesthetic, Dr Laxman continued to make attempts to deliver Baby B by traction and ultimately Baby B\u0027s head became detached from his body. \u0027The evidence suggests, and the Tribunal accepts, that by the time that Baby B\u0027s head became detached from his body he had already died.\u0027Even on her own initial assessment that Patient A\u0027s cervix was 4cm dilated this should have indicated to Dr Laxman that this was insufficient to deliver Baby B\u0027s head.\u0027She should have appreciated that there would be a real and significant risk of complications arising during delivery, namely head entrapment, having had regard to the likely diameter of the baby\u0027s head at this gestation.\u0027Dr Laxman made a decision which was not clinically indicated, in that she failed to perform an immediate delivery by caesarean section under general anaesthetic and instead proceeded with a vaginal delivery.\u0027Her conduct set in train a course of events which ultimately resulted in the decapitation of Baby B and to this extent contributed to that decapitation. \u0027But for Dr Laxman\u0027s error of judgement in this regard, the decapitation would not have occurred.\u0027Laxman will now face further disciplinary hearings which will decide whether she could be struck off.She told the hearing: \u0027I was trying to deliver a live baby, I was trying really hard, possibly too hard. \u0027I did not intend to harm mum or the baby. I am distraught at the outcome and I am very sorry it did not come out the way I meant it.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/00/4CF26D1200000578-5810287-image-a-29_1528241586746.jpg","title":"Incredible aerial devastating lava flows Hawaiis Kilauea volcano","story":"    Several homes were still ablaze on Tuesday after lave flows destroyed  hundreds of properties in the Kapoho area, east of Pahoa, during ongoing eruptions of the Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii           Aerial images captured the devastating lava flows from the Kilauea volcano which destroyed hundreds of homes in one night, including the Big Island county mayor\u0027s second home          Lava erupts in Leilani Estates during ongoing eruptions of the Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii, on Tuesday, after tearing through the islands           The  eruptions have been spewing molten lava, ash clouds and tiny particles of glass as the lava flows reached the sea          Lava flows across a highway on the outskirts of Pahoa during ongoing eruptions of the Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii County Managing Director Wil Okabe said his own vacation home in Kapoho Beach Lots was also threatened.

When lava hits water it sends up a smoke known as laze, which is filled with fine glass particles and hydrochloric acid.In the images, tourists are seen holding up cameras as they approach the smoke, and in some it appears the group are in the midst of it all. Kim, has warned people to \u0027stay away from any ocean plume to prevent harmful health effects\u0027 after the lava inundation.Currently, most boats must keep away from a 300 meter radius of where the lava hits the water.      Lava erupts in Leilani Estates during ongoing eruptions of the Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii, U.S., June 5           Similar events are expected to continue for \u0027months\u0027, Cindi Preller, geologist and duty scientist at the Oahu office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said          On Sunday, the National Guard airlifted two man and a woman from an isolated area to safety after they became surrounded by fast moving lava.

Bannon said he was not too concerned about letting vetted operators head in closer towards the lava, considering the high standards they needed to meetSimilar events are expected to continue for \u0027months\u0027, Cindi Preller, geologist and duty scientist at the Oahu office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told ABC News.  \u0027The volcano is active and when these eruptive sequences get underway it\u0027s doing exactly as it\u0027s supposed to do, behaving as it should,\u0027 she said. On Sunday, the National Guard airlifted two man and a woman from an isolated area to safety after they became surrounded by fast moving lava. Nearly 400 evacuees stayed at shelters on Saturday night, including people from Kapoho Beach Lots and Vacationland, with cell service not working in the area.On Saturday, National Guard troops, police and firefighters ushered evacuees from homes on the eastern tip of the island, hours before lava cut off road access to the area, officials said.          Big Island\u0027s mayor, Harry Kim, warned of volcanic gas emissions, including sulfur dioxide being high in the fissure system. He added: \u0027Residents in the area and downwind should take precaution to limit exposure. Stay alert and be prepared to evacuate with little notice\u0027Jessica Ball, USGS volcanologist said on Sunday that lava was continuing to fountain from fissure 8, \u0027and is feeding a lava flow that has wrapped around the Kapoho Crater to the north and has entered the Vacationland neighborhood. \u0027Lava entered Green Lake at about 10am (June 2), forming a large steam plume, and by 1.30pm lava had filled the lake and boiled off all the water. \u0027At 7am on June 3, the flow front had entered Kapoho beach lots and was about 50 yards from the ocean.\u0027We estimate that the flow front is moving roughly 250 feet per hour, but be advised that this could become faster or slower at any time. There is now no access to Vacationland, Kapoho, or Highways 132 and 137. There was a weak flow from fissure 16, but it has not advanced far beyond the vent. \u0027At the summit, earthquake activity was low and ash emissions from the Halema\u0027uma\u0027u crater were weak. However, gas emissions remain high and we expect small explosive events to continue.\u0027 Hawaii volcano today: Lava from Kilauea destroys more homes, including that of Big Island Mayor Harry Kim - CBS News"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/11/4CF8135300000578-5811449-In_typical_style_he_cracked_a_joke_about_needing_a_new_watch_aft-a-32_1528280563865.jpg","title":"Michael McIntyre confirms continue Big World Tour","story":"    Michael McIntyre gave a cheeky grin after he told MailOnline today he was \u0027feeling better\u0027 after his terrifying knifepoint robbery           In typical style he cracked a joke about needing a new watch after the gang grabbed his Rolex admitting without one he could be late          McIntyre (pictured with his ten-year-old son) was mugged by two masked moped robbers on Monday as he prepared to drive away from school with his boy in North West LondonMcIntyre and young son Oscar, 10, were stopped in a London street by a gang of thugs who smashed his Range Rover with a hammer.The terrifying moment that sums up lawless London: Bystander...London fights back: As a crime wave grips the capital, new...Share this articleShocking moment jilted boyfriend shoots his former girlfriend deadHorrific moment man rams into wife after she asks for orceDisgusting moment patient has hundreds of blackheads removedAstonishing moment bystanders chase moped gang on Regent StreetRobbers flee on moped after robbery at Regent St jewellery shopTake a look around the abandoned village of HoutouwanDisgusting moment rats crawl over burger buns at Burger KingWorld\u0027s first commercial 3D-printed houses built in NetherlandsPolice Officers raid London homes to seize drugs in crackdownCCTV footage of ISIS member Safaa Boular near the MI6 buildingMichael McIntyre, pictured today in London, will return to the stage tomorrow night in Dublin to continue his 104-date Big World Tour, which runs until summer 2019  The comedian, pictured left and right near his home, has tour dates in Ireland and Scotland this month before coming to London in the autumn.

They pulled up to his car as it was stopped by the side of the road near to some traff­ic lights, which were green.\u0027They smashed the window which clearly startled Michael as it would anyone — then he jumped out the passenger’s side and they followed him round.The witness added: \u0027People who saw it were shocked too. No one went to help when it was happening, but it happened so fast, they were gone in seconds. They had hammers and I’m sure I saw one of them with a big knife.\u0027  In a chilling illustration of the moped gang crisis, a young woman was fighting for her life last night after her mobile was snatched by moped-riding thieves. And a motorcycle gang targeted yet another luxury store in London yesterday with pedestrians forced to try to tackle them, wrestling one suspect to the ground.Campaigners and politicians warned the attacks were matched by disturbing rises in stabbings, drug crime and gang violence.London now has a higher murder rate than New York, with more than 70 killings so far this year. Knife crime has also led to the deaths of a 17-year-old boy in Ipswich and of 15-year-olds in Sheffield and Wolverhampton.After an extraordinary day of violence, including the attack on Michael McIntyre, it emerged: Scotland Yard has logged 22,025 motorcycle muggings in 12 months – a rise of 50 per centOfficers revealed that city gangs had set up 650 ‘county line’ networks to sell drugs in towns and villages Police were hunting moped robbers who targeted comedian Michael McIntyre A rank-and-file police leader said officers were wary of chasing them for fear of possible disciplinary action A think-tank said shop theft cost £6.3billion last year – or £270 for every household.David Green, of the Civitas think-tank, said: ‘A fall in police numbers combined with increasingly violent drug gangs has meant some parts of our cities resemble TV’s The Wire. Violent crime is rising and knife crime is rising as gangs fight over drug territories.’Experts believe a booming illicit drugs market – notably in crack cocaine – is fuelling much of the violence. They have also highlighted the middle-class appetite for regular cocaine.The Metropolitan Police figures showed that crimes committed using mopeds, scooters and motorcycles soared by 50 per cent in the year to May, to 22,025.               As the thugs fled, the 42-year-old rushed round to the passenger side of the vehicle to comfort his son (pictured), who is understood to have been in the car at the time of the attackMr McIntyre, 42, who is worth £38million, was waiting outside a school in northLondon, when he was robbed at around 2pm on Monday.Police are investigating whether the moped gang followed him from his £5.7million Hampstead mansion with the aim of grabbing his Rolex or if he was the victim of a random attack because he was driving a luxury car in a wealthy London suburb. The father-of-two was picking up Oscar, 10, who with his brother Lucas, 13, are the source of a lot of his material in his much-loved stand-up routines. Speaking after the incident, Mr McIntyre said: \u0027I can\u0027t really say what\u0027s happening, we\u0027re in the process of sorting this out. There\u0027s been an incident and we\u0027re dealing with it.\u0027I need to find out the best thing to do here, I can\u0027t say anything. This is not a wind up, it\u0027s ongoing and I can\u0027t share the details.\u0027 Journalist Jane Moore, who is married to the comic\u0027s agent Gary Farrow, believes Michael may have been targeted as soon as his son was in the car knowing the star would not risk them harming him.She told ITV\u0027s Loose Women: \u0027How terrifying - his 10-year-old son is in the front seat of the car, and this guy pulls up alongside and he\u0027s got a hammer. To smash a window like that it takes about 10 or 15 goes. Can you imagine how terrified?\u0027They probably targeted him because he had a child in his car, because as a parent you\u0027re not going to take anybody on, you\u0027re going to say, \u0027have whatever you want, don\u0027t hurt me or my child\u0027\u0027,She added: \u0027Somebody please do something about these gangs\u0027 while fellow panelist Anna Richardson said father and son should seek counsellling and revealed she had needed help after she was robbed in a hotel room in 2016. Mr McIntyre was in the Range Rover with his ten-year-old son  in the front passenger seat, one witness told the Mail. They originally claimed the star fell out of the driver\u0027s side and appeared to try to fight off the robbers during the 30-second attack.He then rushed round to the passenger side of the vehicle to comfort his shaken up son and give him a hug.A friend said today Michael, who is currently on the UK leg of his Big World Tour, is \u0027very shaken by the whole experience\u0027 but was uninjured. The moped gang dressed head-to-toe in black pulled up next to him and smashed their way into his car and demanded his Rolex before they sped away.Mr McIntyre\u0027s wife Kitty was reportedly seen close to the damaged car in \u0027floods of tears\u0027 as police spoke to her husband. Today she left the £5.7million family home  and told reporters her husband was \u0027fine\u0027.  Parents on the school run rushed to comfort the shocked star  and he looked shell-shocked and was heard saying: \u0027I need to find out the best thing to do here\u0027.It\u0027s not known if the comedian was targeted or his £120,000 Range Rover was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.             The robbers used hammers to destroy the driver\u0027s window and demanded his silver watch, worth around £15,000            A serious looking Kitty McIntyre, wife of Michael McIntyre, was photographed leaving the family home in North  London yesterday and said her husband is \u0027fine\u0027      Former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan, left, had a £100,000 watch stolen after an armed moped rider stopped his Maserati in Croydon earlier this year. Ex Made in Chelsea star Ashley James, pictured right, was targeted by moped thieves for her phone in MarchMoped riders also stole a £100,000 Franck Muller watch from former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan when he stopped in his Maserati in Croydon.The rider appeared to produce a gun and threatened the businessman through the window.Mr Jordan said his 80-year-old father was also in the car and was \u0027trying to have a pop at the gunman\u0027.A 32-year-old man was arrested and charged over the offence last month. Ex Made in Chelsea star Ashley James was also targetted in March after two moped riders stole her phone near Kilburn station.The 30-year-old model former Celebrity Big Brother star revealed she chased down the thieves and got the phone back after tackling them.She added it was the second time such an incident had happened to her after having her handbag stolen in Barcelona.And Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe rushed to the aid of a tourist slashed in the face by a moped rider last July.The victim was targeted for a Louis Vuitton bag and Radcliffe, 27, rushed over to tend to him after the offenders sped away.  Raiders tried to steal Evening Standard editor George Osborne\u0027s phone as he left the BBC\u0027s Broadcasting House in May last year. Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe rushed to the aid of a tourist slashed in the face by a moped rider last July                        Kitty McIntyre left their £5.7million north London mansion at 8.20am on Tuesday morning and drove their eldest son Lucas, 13, to school. Oscar, ten, who is believed to have witnessed the attack was not with her.She returned to their six bedroom home and parked their silver-grey Range Rover sport courtesy car in the driveway.When asked if they were worried for their family\u0027s safety, the aromatherapist said: \u0027No, no. He\u0027s fine.\u0027The three-storey mansion, with a green door, had every blind and curtain drawn.It is not known if Michael, who is one of the most successful comedians of all time, is at home.His Range Rover, with the shattered window, was not outside his home. Moped crime has been described as being \u0027out of control\u0027 in London with 23,000 offences last year - up from 827 reported incidents in 2012. Gangs all over the capital have been trying to rip valuables such as phones and jewellery from drivers and pedestrians including millionaire Simon Jordan, whose £127,000 watch was taken at gunpoint as he sat in his Masarati in March.George Osborne almost had his phone ripped from his hand outside the BBC in May last year and Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe ran to the aid of a tourist who was attacked in Fulham. Michael McIntyre had been sitting outside the  school when two masked riders brandishing hammers pulled up next to him.They then smashed through his driver\u0027s window and stole his watch. It is not known if they took other items like his wallet and phone. One witness said: \u0027The guy at the front of the moped started to hit the driver\u0027s window about ten to 15 times and it eventually just cracked. He opens the door and gets Michael McIntyre out of the car. Michael fell but he was still trying to put up a fight.\u0027I just remember one of the bikers trying to get something. I don\u0027t know what the guy was trying to get – a watch, a wallet, maybe?\u0027And then within seconds they were gone down the hill. It was all so quick – the whole thing must have taken 30 seconds\u0027.He added he thought that Michael\u0027s son was in the car with him and was hugged by his dad and school friends afterwards.             Mr Mcintyre was photographed looking shell-shocked by his £120,000 Range Rover after yesterday afternoon\u0027s attack            The millionaire comedian was sitting in his Range Rover at around 2pm yesterday when the thugs started trying to smash his window with a hammerAnother witness said: \u0027I was driving along the road when I saw two men dressed head to toe in black. One man was on the bike and the other was either attacking or fighting Michael McIntyre. There was shouting too.\u0027The driver\u0027s window of his Range Rover was completely smashed. The second guy jumped on the back of the motorbike and they got away\u0027.       1.

It took too much effort,\u0027 said a woman who gave only her surname Wang.The former resident, now in her 40s, only returns these days to earn extra money as a safety officer, keeping an eye on the tourists.           The island looks like a scene from a movie set and almost every metre of the stone buildings have been overtaken by vines          Vines climbing up buildings, along the paths and through the windows of former homes are so beautiful they look deliberate          What was once home to fishermen and their families in a once thriving village is now overgrown, eerie and abandoned\u0027It was a lot of fun when we were young, going down to the beach to collect seafood,\u0027 she said.But by the mid-1990s the village, which once had as many as 3,000 residents, was largely abandoned in favour of a neighbouring town on the island.\u0027Once people had more money, they all moved out one after another up into the town.

Share them with our picture editor carly.earl@theIn 1972, Alan Adler owned a grocery shop that wasn’t doing very well. An advertisement in the Age promised him $80 a week if, instead, he ran a photobooth – a contraption that he did not understand. He bought two.“It was a disaster from day one,” he said. “One of the thermostats malfunctioned in the booth which caused the photo to come out white. I had no idea what a photobooth was about, and hadn’t seen one before I bought one.”Since those first two, the 86-year-old now owns “too many” black and white photobooths throughout Melbourne to remember – though many are now in his garage, victims of the digital photo revolution. His most famous booth, at Melbourne’s Flinders Street station, has just been given a reprieve from a planned removal. It will remain at the station, though in a different spot.“We didn’t really make any real money out of the photobooth until the $1 coin came in,” he says. “Before that you had to use four 20c coins and we would charge you 80c. Not many people carried four 20c cents with them so I wasn’t really very popular. Then the $2 coin come out and we were really making money!”Adler’s booths use the old school method, with silver-halide film, thick paper and a cocktail of six or seven different chemicals.“You can’t have a better photograph than a proper photographic process with the chemicals,” he says. “With a very expensive digital camera you can get close, but it doesn’t have the warmth or the character. Our photos are really long lasting. I’ve photos I took 46 years ago, good as the day they were taken.”Fans and customers send him nice messages from time to time, which he especially enjoys.“I got some very lovely letters” he says. One was from a group who met up on the last day that one of his booths was in operation. “We want to thank you for so many years of happiness,” they wrote.Now, the business has changed, and Alder says it’s no longer viable. It costs $2,000 for him to buy just one chemical used in the processing. “We really never charged enough,” he says. “Then digital photobooths came on to the market and we lost our locations.“It’s been my whole life. We’ve met fellow photobooth operators all around the world. We’ve been to America a few times to get spare parts for machines. We met a guy in Switzerland. It’s been our life for 50 years.” Do you have your own pictures from the Flinders Street photobooth?

This is so much the case that the decision not to have children may now be more of a taboo than maternal ambivalence. There was Selfish, Shallow and Self-Absorbed, an essay collection edited by Meghan Daum in 2015, and there are a few self-help books. But now Sheila Heti’s book seems likely to become the defining literary work on the subject, perhaps most of all because as a novel, replete with ambiguity and contradiction, it refuses to define anything, and certainly not the childlessness that provides its subject or the motherhood that provides its title.On the eve of her 37th birthday, Heti’s narrator, who may or may not be Heti herself, asks, fearfully, whether she wants to have a child. The circumstances for procreation are unpropitious: she is impecunious, orced and committed to her writing. But she’s in a relationship with Miles, a man she loves she likes the idea of opening herself to the peculiar magic of pregnancy and childbirth. Beneath it all lies a worry that childrearing might prove an anticlimax, and a belief that motherhood is a “once necessary, now sentimental gesture”. So, preoccupied by these questions, she decides to document her quest by creating a work of art that might outweigh her need for a child. She structures the process through a series of dialogues with three coins, which give yes and no answers as in the ancient Chinese system of ination.The quest lasts three years, until she’s 40, and turns out to be a journey less towards childlessness than towards enlightenment. The narrator begins with a phrase lodged insistently in her mind: “the soul of time”. She isn’t sure whether this collective soul “belongs to time or is time” or whether “our lives – we – are time’s soul”. The answer emerges as both, the goal to enter into dialogue with the eternal. We use children, she suggests, to distract ourselves from our spiritual deficiencies. Therefore the apparent failure of childlessness can be a way of impelling ourselves into a battle to “erase the boundary between the spiritual and the physical, and finally become whole”, which is figured here as Jacob wrestling with the angel in Genesis.This narrative of spiritual growth is interwoven with a more overtly feminist narrative in which she considers the place of children and childbearing within our culture. She is angry about the over-validation of motherhood and the sense that women’s bodies belong to everybody but themselves. “There is something threatening about a woman who is not occupied with children … What sort of trouble will she make?” At one stage she contemplates giving the money she would have spent on childrearing to an abortion charity.This sounds hard-hitting, and it is, but it’s also deeply ambivalent, woven as one strand among many in a book that does, after all, claim to be a novel. Perhaps it’s most novelistic in its dextrous use of the present tense (there is a sense of a life unfolding, rather than being recorded) and in the sense, gradually built up, that the book knows more than the narrator does, in her fear and rage and naivety. The most novelistic scenes are those that portray the relationship with Miles, and it’s here that the various strands of the book converge. Conversations, arguments and sex with him provide most of the daily life of the book.The struggle is to bring this relationship, too, into the eternal. Miles frustrates her with his patience and certainty he has a child already, and is satisfied with their coupling as it is, so he doesn’t wish to have a child with her. The narrator is more impatient and wilful, and is anxious that his not wanting a child is a sign of loving her insufficiently. She comes to consider the possibility that his finding her enough may be itself a demonstration of love: “I wondered if his not needing me to be a mother revealed a deeper respect for me and for women than even I had.”The move towards the soul of time, or towards an acceptance of her place within it, is enabled by art and by a reckoning with its place in her life. There’s a moving passage where the narrator sees the writers who have formed her as pulling her backward into the literary past of her forebears, whereas motherhood pushes you into the future of your children. This is a reminder that she has her own genealogy as well as her own literary fecundity.She is asking what her book can count for, and the answer is a lot. It’s hard to do justice to its complexity. This is less a book than a tapestry – a finely wrought work of delicate art. Is it worth as much as a child? Is it worth less? Or more? “The childless and the mothers are equivalent,” the narrator learns. “A person who can’t understand why someone doesn’t want children only has to locate their feelings for children, and imagine that desire directed somewhere else – to a life that is just as filled with hope, purpose, futurity and care.”Lara Feigel is the author of Free Woman: Life, Liberation and Doris Lessing (Bloomsbury). • Motherhood is published by Harvill Secker.

Should the case still be ongoing after three years, the EU plans to impose further tariffs of €3.6bn on US products.After a meeting of senior EU officials, the European commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič told reporters in Brussels that the EU regretted the White House’s “illegal” act.He said: “The new duties start applying in July. It is a measured and proportionate response to the unilateral and illegal decision taken by the United States.”Fox, an advocate of Brexit, has been cautious in backing the EU’s retaliatory measures in public. He has also suggested that the UK is likely to be handed an exemption from the US tariffs once the country has left the EU.However, Jyrki Katainen, the commission’s vice-president for jobs and a former Finnish prime minister, said that all the member states had agreed with the action to be taken against US importers and recognised the need to stand together.He said: “We have had the full support from all the member states on these issues which we are about to propose now. All the member states understand that if they want to defend rules and trade we have to play by the book. It is difficult to assess what President Trump will decide to do next but this is our response.”Meanwhile the UK, France and Germany have signed a joint letter demanding that European companies are spared from US sanctions imposed on Iran after Trump’s decision to pull out of the nuclear agreement with Tehran known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).The three EU member states were signatories to the 2015 deal, which sought to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.Their letter to the US Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, seeks confirmation that EU interests will not be hit by secondary sanctions on companies working in Iran.They write: “Building on our discussions at several occasions, as close allies we expect that the extraterritorial effects of US secondary sanctions will not be enforced on EU entities and iniduals, and the United States will thus respect our political decision and the good faith of economic operators within EU legal territory.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc8e2ccb5f39493d6ea6dece029b66310e652b6b/314_49_3156_1893/master/3156.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57985281095b87ac152f5eb07148cfb6","title":"qatar airways ceo apologises for suggesting a woman could not do his job","story":"Akbar Al Baker offers ‘heartfelt apologies’ after saying firm has to be led by a manThe boss of Qatar Airways, who sits on the board of Heathrow, has offered his “heartfelt apologies” for his suggestion that a woman would not be able to do his job, which inflamed a row over sexism in the aviation industry.Referring to his role as chief executive of the Gulf carrier, Akbar Al Baker stunned a press conference on Tuesday by saying: “Of course, it has to be led by a man because it is a very challenging position.” The comments came just after he became chair of the International Air Transport Association’s board of governors for a one-year term.He later defended Qatar Airways’ record on gender equality but failed to quash mounting criticism. The airline issued a statement on Tuesday referring to his “lightheartedness” at press conferences.A day later it released another statement from Al Baker, who has run the carrier since 1997. “I would like to offer my heartfelt apologies for any offence caused by my comment yesterday, which runs counter to my track record of expanding the role of women in leadership throughout the Qatar Airways Group and has been sensationalised by the media,” he said. The Gulf carrier has a close business partnership with British Airways and is also the largest single shareholder in BA’s parent company, IAG.Qatar Airways has caused controversy in the past for its treatment of its predominantly female cabin crew, at one time firing them for being pregnant.However, Al Baker said in the statement: “Qatar Airways firmly believes in gender equality in the workplace and our airline has been a pioneer in our region in this regard, as the first airline to employ female pilots, as one of the first to train and employ female engineers, and with females represented through to senior vice-president positions within the airline reporting directly to me.”He said he supported all Iata initiatives to promote the advancement of women in the industry.It is not the first time Al Baker’s comments have provoked controversy. At a dinner speech in Ireland last year, he said US airlines were “crap” and their passengers were “always being served by grandmothers”, while boasting that “the average age of my cabin crew is only 26”. He later apologised for his “careless” remarks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e549664ea0eed6e6013c549fe55e90106cc1b10e/0_198_3661_2197/master/3661.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5e530d6cfafcd85932c5afb58bfa23f","title":"tsb boss faces mps it meltdown fca criticism paul pester business live","story":"Paul Pester, the CEO of TSB, is being hauled back to parliament to answer questions about its botched IT migrationQuestion: In how many cases since the migration, when there has been an investi of the customer being liable, has there been a delay in compensation.Pester says we said we are not challenging or investigating customers as we created the uncertainty. To the best of my knowledge the answer is zero.MPs are giving more examples of customers suffering problems.Pester apologises if he gave the impression he was downplaying the seriousness of the problems facing the bank.He also says he is sorry if the committee thinks he is not keeping his customers up to date.Pester says I told you the information I had at the time.Question: Banks should refund by the end of the following day when there is fraud. Has TSB done that?Pester admits TSB has not done that.Morgan talks about a self employed printer who wanted to access his money. He talks to TSB, gets another call from a mobile, is advised to talk to the person on the mobile. Then he thinks he’s been defrauded, finds £24,550 been taken from his account and TSB say he does not know how long it will be to get his money back. He has problems contacting TSB, finally gets his money back, changes account.Then he gets a letter, saying TSB is not at fault, and it offered £192. Is that a fair outcome.Pester says the details are distressing and I apologise. We will of course look at this case, and address them. He was caught up in that attack, I would like to take his case further.Chairman Richard Meddings also apologies, says its difficult to comment on whether the payments are sufficient. They don’t necessarily seem to be a correct calculation, but we are attempting to set a framework of compensations taking into account stress and consequential loss.Morgan says the more important point, and where TSB is tone deaf, where the letter suggests customer has to prove the point.Meddings says, I get your point. When fraudsters raid accounts, banks can says customers are negligent but we are trying to compensate in full without asking about liability.Morgan says during last hearing, the TSB twitter account said fraud lines were experiencing higher than usual levels. If twitter knew that why didn’t you?Pester apologies (again!) and says the number he gave in good faith was the number he had at the time.Morgan says does TSB deserve nickname of Terribly Shambolic Bank?Pester says this whole situation has been a terrible situation for TSB customers. All I can do is work hard to fix this situation.Morgan says Pester had said in a letter yesterday that between 23 April to 31 May, some 2,200 TSB customers had experienced attempts to access their accounts and 1300 suffered financial loss. But the FCA mentioned 10,000 incidents. For some customers this is not happening once but several times. Isn’t it typical that every time TSB is asked, you try to be clever with the numbers.Pester says he’s sorry if that seems to be the case. The FCA number refers to alerts on accounts, pointing out unusual transaction patterns, which trigger text messages to see if they are genuine. If we don’t hear we block the accounts until we are able to speak to the customer.The 2,200 number is number of customers who had attempts to defraud.Morgan says how many fraud incidents where people had money taken out of their accounts were there?Pester says 1300 had money taken out of their account by fraudsters, and we have refunded them.Morgan points out Pester said at the last hearing that people were waiting only three minutes on the fraud line.Pester says at the last meeting we had not been subject to fraud attacks at that level, it started on the first bank holiday in May, peaked on 15 May, then came under control since. At first meeting we were not subject to those levels of attack.That was the true statement of the situation at the time.I am sorry if I appear to have been unforthright in evidence.Pester says the system tracking fraud still blocks accounts if it detects unusual patterns etc, so there are other ways than just customer reporting fraud.Pester says the volume of attacks were 70 times the normal level of attacks. That overwhelmed TSB. So we put in a dedicated line.Fraud is a terrible experience. That fraud line has a two to three minute wait time. I apologise profusely to those customers who have suffered fraud.Pester says it is still the same team, but we recruited more partners so we could respond more quickly.Morgan asks how long people have waited over recent weeks.Pester says it is a priority line so it is a matter of minutes. We have tightened up our fraud defences, and now volume is two or three times normal level.Morgan says people are talking about waiting for hours.Pester says that was before the new line. He apologises again and says it was unacceptable. The level of fraud was unprecedented.But Morgan says in your planning you anticipated an increase in fraudulent activity, so it wasn’t unprecedented.Pester says sadly yes, we had our teams on high intensity when we migrated but it was higher than expected.I have been shocked to read of customers waiting five, seven, nine hours. When I saw that I said we had to fix this. Putting a new line in was very important.Now TSB are up and Nicky Morgan begins with the issue of fraud.Question: Have conditions create a spate of fraudulent activity?Pester says he regrets but the situation gave an opportunity for fraudsters to target customers.Morgan says they have to phone a dedicated fraud line, and is the route to get compensation.Pester agrees but they says customers can report fraud to branches or online, but there is a dedicated line.Ultimately though it all ends up with fraud team.The FCA session ends on that note.John Mann ask who should be held to account?Bailey says that’s the purpose of the investigation. But at the moment the most important thing is to dig out of hole.Mann says will you use the full range of your powers?Bailey says we will use the powers.Question: The last IT meltdown was Co-op. How many other banks are at similar risks with antiquated IT systems?Bailey says there are major IT changes going on most weekends in the banking systems. This year in particular there has been ringfencing.In this case it was a complete replatforming, from the Lloyds sytems to a new one.Most institutions are operating on systems which have evolved over years.There is a lot still to learn about this one, he says. What would it take for us to observe this in a way TSB management did not, what level of intrusion would be needed?We were involved in the Visa incident, that was a hardware failure. We seek to learn but can’t give an assurance these things will never happen again.Question: Will you set out what minimum compensation should be?Bailey says we will want to see how they set it up and calibrate it. There should be a minimum standard below which compensation applies. Services have not been affected evenly, this is one of the problems.Bailey is told the FCA should set down the law otherwise people will not have confidence, especially given the problems small businesses have faced with banks, especially GRG.Bailey says he hopes they appreciate how much the FCA has been involved with TSB. He says the FCA put a team on site very quickly.Question: TSB have appointed Deloitte to look at compensation, how is it going?Bailey says we are pleased they have brought in outside resources, they have been overwhelmed. They are taking it seriously but we want to see it up and running.Howard says they are recruiting staff to deal with compensation. They have started to resolve and settle complaints.Bailey says this should happen quite quickly, it is not very complex. The timeline is short in terms of when things went wrong.Question: In some cases when customers asked to switch, bank has written to some of their direct debit accounts saying they had died, are you aware of this?Bailey says that is another example of putting in a fix in to solve a problem and another part sends out a letter. Don’t think they did that intentionally.Question: Does it undermine the system if people see this happening and are reluctant to switch.Bailey says longer term we will have to see the level of switching and if it is happening effectively.Question: are you confident no other banks do this?Bailey says I think we would know that.Question: Who controlled the timing of migration of IT systems {TSB or parent company?]On the question of accountability, Bailey says in this case there is a relationship with an outsourcer (in this case part of the parent company). You can’t outsource responsibility, and it rests with the management of the TSB.Question: have TSB now got it right?Bailey says they have improved considerably. The days of the rather generalised and rosy statements, we haven’t seen them so often. But it is still important, there are a lot of things going wrong in branches, quite basis and important things. These things still need fixing and it will take time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c82f35cb7d5573c504d2f8127679e87fdffc6c1/0_108_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9dd6a9081f9ab62091a44669941b600d","title":"fix eu single currency does not work","story":"Even when it was clearly in decline, the Soviet Union commanded loyal devotion. Its admirers could never quite grasp that the nation instrumental in winning the second world war had a broken economy.The same cognitive dissonance applies to the European Union today. There is the EU as it exists in the minds of its most avid supporters: fast-growing, a defender of progressive values, fighting the good fight against Thatcherism, and marching steadfastly towards greater integration.Then there is the EU as it really is: struggling economically wedded to an aggressive form of neoliberal economics insistent that there is no alternative to a top-down, ever-closer union and spawning anti-elite parties across the continent.Like the USSR under Gorbachev, Europe needs radical reform before it is too late because, as George Soros noted last week, everything that could go wrong has gone wrong. The EU is saddled with a single currency that doesn’t work but unable to admit it. It has forced its weaker members to suffer the consequences of the euro’s design weaknesses with austerity policies it has told those who complain about low growth and high unemployment to sort out their own problems through structural reforms (wage cuts and privatisation) and it has failed to comprehend the anger felt at mass immigration, which has increased the pool of readily available cheap labour.A\u0026nbspparticularly serious\u0026nbspform of this cognitive dissonance seems to afflict\u0026nbspsome left-leaning remainers in the UK. They appear to have forced Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell into softening (or fudging) Labour’s stance on\u0026nbspthe single market, even though they were two of the very few Labour MPs who rightly predicted where Europe would end up if it insisted on following rightwing economic policies.And their insistence that the best way to help those who voted for Brexit is a reformed UK in a reformed EU glides over the fact that they rarely come up with any ideas for what these reforms might look like or how they might come about. That, of course, is because they have no plan other than to return Britain to its blissful prelapsarian state before the referendum. Gordon Brown’s plan to tackle the causes of Brexit – low wages, the sense of being cast adrift, the pressures from migration, the loss of sovereignty and concerns about the NHS – is a welcome and timely exception to this rule. But Brown’s warning that serious change is needed to prevent Britain being permanently paralysed applies equally to the rest of Europe, ided between social liberals and conservatives, between a rich north and a poorer south, and between those for whom globalisation works and those for whom it doesn’t.Those who think that Euroscepticism is just a British phenomenon need to take a long, hard look at the populism on the march across Europe and ask themselves why it is happening. Then they need to work out what they are going to do about it.One option, proposed by Emmanuel Macron, is to make Europe more like the US. Macron’s argument, which makes a lot of sense, is that the single currency is an unfinished and hence inherently unstable construct, which needs a much bigger budget, run by a single finance minister, to even out variations in economic performance. But there is little appetite in the rest of the EU for Macron’s plan, particularly where it really counts: in Germany.Another option would be for Italy to precipitate change by leaving the euro. This is even less likely than adoption of Macron’s plans, because as soon as the financial markets got whiff of the idea it would result in sky-high Italian interest rates and the collapse of an already shaky banking system. Italians with savings would see their value decimated by a return to the lira. The only way Italy will leave the euro is by mistake, and then it would be catastrophic.A third option would be for the conduct of European economic policy to become less fixated on austerity. There could be less emphasis on hitting arbitrary budget deficit targets, a move away from the neoliberal structural adjustment policies imposed on those countries seeking support, an acceptance that those countries trying to cope with migration flows across the Mediterranean need much more financial help than they are currently getting, and a Marshall plan for Africa of the sort floated by Soros. All would be welcome: all would meet with strong opposition from Angela Merkel.By far the best option would be for Germany to take the initiative and announce that it was leaving the single currency, taking a small group of northern European countries with it. This would have a number of clear advantages. First, it would remove the stigma of leaving the euro because the decision would be taken from a position of strength not weakness. Second, the new mark would be a lot stronger than the euro and that would help iron out some of the imbalances in Europe’s economy by making German exports dearer and German imports cheaper. Third, the new hard eurozone would be more like Germany’s original vision of what it imagined monetary union would look like.Fourth, it would breathe new life into plans for\u0026nbspEuropean integration because it could start small and get bigger over time. Countries such as the Netherlands and Austria would be obvious choices as\u0026nbspfounder members of a smaller club bound by common fiscal rules.Finally, it would make a reality of a multispeed Europe in which some countries would be members of the hard eurozone, some would be actively planning to join it once their economies were ready, and some would decide they never wanted to join.As things stand, this is just as big a fantasy as Macron’s integrationist blueprint. Germany is the one country that has really benefited from the single currency and is not going to propose a hard-mark zone that might exclude France. Macron would throw a wobbly if it did.But if European leaders had the opportunity to turn the clock back to before the euro was introduced, this is the sort of plan they would probably come up with. And if this sort of EU had seemed feasible in June 2016, the UK would never have voted for Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b98f35d55c046e907172e069d7706244fe91d0c/0_237_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6be26ae3b8fb7cc6effa6fc5b9db4133","title":"labour brexit plan remainers leavers norway model customs model eu","story":"While the Norway model would deny Britain power, a new customs union could allow for compromise with the EUFor Britain’s future prosperity, it is vital that close economic cooperation with our European partners is secured and sustained. Nearly half of the UK’s international trade is with the other EU member states, and our place in the EU single market is at the centre of the UK investment case. Departing from single-market regulations simply means more complexity for business, not more competitiveness there is no evidence whatsoever that the agility of an independent trade policy trumps the benefits of scale in trade negotiations.That’s why it is important for Britain to stay aligned with the single market and to form a new and comprehensive customs union. Brexit is a political departure but it does not need to be an economic rupture. The question is how these goals can be achieved while respecting the referendum result.Compromise is inevitable. Labour’s shift in Brexit policy appears to reflect this understanding, and is a better approach than remaining in the European Economic Area (EEA), the approach known as the Norway option. Here’s why.Advocates of Britain rejoining the EEA argue that time is running out, so we must take an “off-the-shelf” model. In the spirit of best is the enemy of good enough, is the EEA good enough for Britain? The short answer is no. Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein must implement single-market regulations and the four freedoms – goods, services, people and capital – apply just as they do to EU member states. The EEA states participate in committees to influence draft legislation, but they are not members of the single market’s decision-making structures. They have influence, but little leverage and no formal power.EEA membership would mean Britain would have little option but to adopt regulations that it had no role in deciding. There would be no requirement to take into account British interests or objections. It would be democratically intolerable for a government to systematically implement decisions over which it had no say. And joining the EEA would substitute one European court for another. If Britain were to join, there would be a very real risk of a double-Brexit: leaving the EU and later crashing out of the EEA.It would allow exploitative politicians on the populist right and left – and opportunist politicians in the centre – to continue to attribute Britain’s very real but self-authored problems to others and not to ourselves. The great deceit of British politics for the past 40 years has been passing off unpopular choices made in Westminster as instructions received from Brussels. EEA membership would allow that cowards’ game to continue, and resentment to build, nourishing a narrative of betrayal.It is also a moot point. The EEA is not on the table in the Brexit negotiations because, while EEA members are bound to adopt single-market regulations, there are no consequences for failing to do so. For EU negotiators, this is a loophole so large that the world’s fifth largest economy could be driven through it. Moreover, they see it as a functioning agreement that they have no appetite to disrupt. The EU is not insisting on the EEA, so why promote an off-the-shelf model when a bespoke one could be negotiated?The past two years should have been dedicated to building a new British partnership with the EU, a compromise that keeps us economically close while respecting the referendum result. Even now, Michel Barnier has said that the EU would be open to further negotiation during the transition, and indeed to a more comprehensive renegotiation, should there be either a change of prime minister or a change of government open to it.It makes sense for the UK to seek a model that better reflects its priorities, in particular a clear and feasible option to erge if future rules are introduced that run counter to our interests. Last December, we at IPPR proposed building what we call a “shared market”, based on regulatory alignment between the UK and the EU single market, and a new and comprehensive customs union, underpinned by a new, independent UK court of justice and UK supervision authority. The proposal has gathered interest from Brussels and other European capitals. It would solve the Irish border problem, too.It would aim for Britain to stay in alignment but allow for the possibility of ergence over time, with a “declaration of incompatibility” that would give either side six months to bring regulation into alignment again. If they chose not to, then there would be proportionate consequences. Britain could choose to pursue a different path, not in the costless fantasy of the extreme Brexiters, but rather fully cognisant of the consequences.A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.Some aspects of single-market regulation could be more fixed than others. For example, workers’ rights and environmental protections could be subject to “non-regression” clauses that would protect British workers and assuage the concerns, particularly in Scandinavia, that the UK would undercut standards.Allowing for the possibility of ergence would make it clear that Britain was making an active, positive and sovereign choice to be part of the single market. Moreover, it would give Britain a degree of leverage in how the European economic project develops. We would have traded power for influence with leverage.As a new agreement, Britain would be able to negotiate a compromise on freedom of movement. This might include implementation of existing enforcement measures, restricting access to welfare payments as negotiated by David Cameron in 2016, and a Swiss-style local labour market system that allows for priority to be given to job-seekers based in the UK over European workers in certain sectors.The shared market approach would honour the vote to leave, while reflecting the reality that the result was close.Compromise is never fashionable. But the vast majority of UK people, whether they voted to leave or to remain, want the government to negotiate a deal that respects the referendum result without damaging the economy. In a shared market, there is the kind of compromise that might just work for both sides of the Brexit ide. If only the government were prepared to negotiate for it.• Tom Kibasi is director of IPPR and co-author of The Shared Market: A New Proposal for a Future Partnership between the UK and the EU"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d0f55fcd40887725b20a6f4de02cb75f37884ad/1463_376_3110_1866/master/3110.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc2bfc1b33a18c29865c1e7b4987a49a","title":"ben fogle i climbed everest expecting a rubbish dump but what i found surprised me","story":"A huge clean-up is returning the world’s highest mountain to its former gloryJust over two weeks ago I was standing on the roof of the world, both figuratively and literally. I was 8,848 metres up on the summit of Mount Everest. It was the culmination of many years’ hard work, and the realisation of a childhood dream.I have been overwhelmed by the tide of goodwill and support but one thing has become increasingly apparent. In many people’s minds, Everest has lost her crown. She has become a mountain synonymous with death, exploitation and pollution.The most common question I get asked is: “Is it covered in rubbish?” As United Nations patron of the wilderness, one of my roles is to report back from the Earth’s remaining wildernesses and to act as a voice for the wild. One reason I wanted to climb Everest was to see for myself if it is indeed, as is often reported, “the world’s highest garbage dump”. I also wanted to ensure I undertook an ethical climb in which I minimised my environmental footprint while maximising the ethics of working with the Sherpas. I had heard tales of a mountain of litter, discarded bottles, human excrement. I prepared myself for the worst. The Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee estimates that 100,000 people, mainly trekkers, visit the region each year making the route to base camp one of the busiest and most popular trails in the world. Add to this the thousand people who descend on to Everest base camp for their summit attempts each year and you can see how it might get its reputation, but here’s the thing: I hardly saw any litter, from the airport at Lukla to the summit.The Nepalese have taken on some huge clean-up campaigns in recent years, perhaps to improve their reputation, but also in response to some tragic natural disasters. The 2015 earthquake wiped out the Nepalese base camp, not only with a terrible loss of life but also an environmental disaster after all the equipment from rescued climbers was abandoned. The government implemented a number of requirements including that each climber removes an additional 8kg of litter (not including their own) and incentives for Sherpas of $2 per kilo of rubbish removed. They imposed “litter fines” at base camp and tried to address the problem of human faeces by encouraging people to take bags with them to carry their own poo off the mountain (the same applies in Antarctica). The results have been stunning. The country lanes of Great Britain have more rubbish than the trail to base camp despite the 100,000 footfall I saw one of the cleanest, tidiest wilderness trials I have encountered. One of the most common questions is whether the mountain is littered with oxygen bottles. While I’m sure this has been a problem in the past, it certainly isn’t today. Each bottle is worth up to $500, and in a country where that is approximately the average annual income, no bottle is ever discarded. I saw Sherpas climb the entire mountain to collect a used bottle. I did pass plenty of bottles during my climb but these had been cached by expeditions for their climb and are all removed from the mountain. Base camp, too, was litter-free with all waste being carefully sorted and carried down the mountain by yak. Camp 2 has been the focus of much attention but even here, above the Khumbu icefall, I saw teams of people carefully gathering rubbish before descending back through the notorious danger spot. Once past Camp 2, I only saw a pristine mountain. Climbers were largely respectful, and even carried their own poo off the mountain. The biggest problem is Camp 4, or the South Col. A wretched place, it is littered with stripped tents and poles that have been trashed by the 100mph winds that regularly beat the world’s highest camp ground. The ground is strewn with abandoned expedition gear that has become frozen into the snow and ice. It would be almost impossible to remove it. It’s not ideal, but in some ways Camp 4 is a frozen time capsule of mankind’s relationship with Everest. Thousands have climbed her slopes in the pursuit of their own dreams and aspirations. It is like a slightly rougher version of Scott or Shackleton’s huts in Antarctica a reminder, however unsightly, of our relationship with the wilderness. I have spent time in many of the world’s popular wilderness locations and I would say Nepal should be proud. It is an example of man repairing the damage he has done. As our focus turns to the oceans and the seemingly impossible task of repairing our marine habitat, we could look at Everest as a fine example of turning back the clock.• Ben Fogle is UN Environment patron of the wilderness.

Could this be the future of shopping?Love Island has it all – sun, sex, suspiciously orange men, and now, shopping. Last week, the reality TV show announced that this year it will partner with the high-street fashion brand Missguided, not only to style the contestants, but also to direct viewers to shop the looks they see on telly through the Love Island app. In a move to capitalise on its captive audience, the institution that is Love Island continues to capture the hearts – and now wallets – of fans everywhere.“It’s about having a direct hotline straight to their target demographic,” says Leanne Elliott-Young, fashion partnerships expert and founder of fashion futures studio CommuneEAST. She thinks that the collaboration, which allows viewers to either shop items in the “Love Island style” or, sometimes, the exact garments worn by the contestants, is a clever tactic to bypass the structures of influencer marketing, which, she says, we are beginning to trust less.It might not seem like an obvious parallel, but a line can be drawn between what Love Island is doing for high-street shopping now and what Burberry once did for the luxury market – the brand’s See Now Buy Now format, which has since been limited to capsule collections, was a radical approach to seasonal catwalk shopping when it first launched in 2016. By reducing the time that people had to wait to get an item of clothing from a whole season to offering instant gratification, the brand gave the world of high fashion something a little like farm-to-table, except, well, catwalk to home delivery. Although it was difficult to do (and played a big part in disrupting the fashion calendar), it allowed people to tap into the excitement of the catwalk show and, much like Love Island is doing, turned shopping into part of the entertainment itself.Love Island is tapping into the tastes of its “fandom” and allowing Missguided to speak directly to that base at a time when brands such as Marks \u0026amp Spencer are falling short, because they are basing their offering on the high-street myth of the everywoman. “I think it’s about brands capitalising on the look and feel of this particular TV programme,” says Laura Saunter, retail editor at fashion forecasting agency WGSN.In 2014, Fashion app TAGit tried to do this by letting users shop items from TV shows such as Keeping Up with the Kardashians and Scandal. But with visual search tools now embedded into many shopping sites such as Asos, which allow shoppers to upload or take an image and then search Asos’s products for clothing that is similar to what’s pictured, “you no longer need apps like TAGit to help you hunt down something you see on TV,” says Saunter. In an era where we are shopping in store less and online more this is, she thinks, a further development to making it easier to find exactly what you want. Elliott-Young thinks that it’s also about the way that many people are watching Love Island while simultaneously tweeting and texting on their phones, making it a slippery slope to online shopping sites and apps. And seeing the clothes in action on the show helps them make quicker decisions, because it makes the online shopping experience a little more real.Fashion websites are trying to incorporate this idea, too: “If you look at the majority of them now they have a video element of a model, so you can see what the item of clothing looks like when you walk in it,” she says. But Love Island goes one better. “People want to know what it looks like when they sit in it, or what happens with their swimsuit when they get in a jacuzzi. Love Island and Missguided are essentially putting the clothes in context.”Whether this entertainment-fuelled, impulse-driven type of shopping, in a country where £3.1bn a month is spent on impulse buys alone, will only work with the low price points that fast fashion brands provide remains to be seen. And only time will tell whether watching Love Islanders in swimsuits will actually compel us to buy one. Let’s just hope our summer purchase decisions won’t be as misguided as some of our romantic ones."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c526bf7b4b7ce979f885b869370cd4fc7919dcf3/0_13_3791_2275/master/3791.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c8f4add4954c8ef9b799d736585af6d","title":"mcqueen review alexander mcqueen fashion tom ford","story":"Ian Bonhôte’s documentary conveys the outrageous glory of the designer’s work and poignantly unpicks his inner issuesSince the fashion designer Alexander McQueen took his own life at the age of 40 in 2010, his life and work has been mythologised in a colossally successful exhibition in London and New York entitled Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty, and there has been a projected movie – now reportedly on hold – to which Jack O’Connell and Andrew Haigh were once attached as star and director. Now there is this sombre, thorough, intelligent and informative documentary by Ian Bonhôte giving us the moving story of a working-class boy with fierce and original talent who began as a tailor’s apprentice in Savile Row before getting mentored into the big league by fashion writer and salonnière Isabella Blow, and whose increasingly outrageous and confrontational shows made him one of the fashion world’s biggest stars.One interviewee laughingly talks about “unwearability”. Of course. No designer could make it clearer that these shows are not about clothes to buy on the high street, but huge theatrical events to showcase the brand. McQueen was a key figure in the creativity industries of 90s Cool Britannia (although Bonhôte doesn’t make the obvious comparison to Damien Hirst and Charles Saatchi’s “young British artists” generation).Finally the hysterical intensity of the work, publicity and the loneliness of command took its toll, memories of abuse by his older sister’s husband were never entirely expunged, he was deeply depressed by becoming HIV-positive and by the deaths of Blow and also his mother, to whom he was utterly devoted. Perhaps you really had to be there but the sheer audacity and craziness of his shows comes across here, especially his Voss from 2001, with a central, shocking image based on Joel-Peter Witkin’s Sanitorium. Afterwards, Tom Ford is shown making admiring comments.It was only watching this that I realised that Ford must surely have been inspired by McQueen’s Voss for the beginning of his movie Nocturnal Animals.

Once you’ve had your fill of peas popped straight from the pod, this is a good way to make use of those cosy-looking containers, as well as their sweet contents.1.2kg peas in the pod, to get 450g shelled peas (or 450g frozen peas)4 spring onions2 rashers smoked streaky bacon (optional)30g butter, or 2 tbsp rapeseed oil750ml water (or vegetable stock if not using bacon)1 squeeze lemon juice1 pinch sugar (optional)Salt and black pepper1 pinch nutmeg (optional)Shell the peas, reserving five of the empty pods to flavour the soup. Peas are best enjoyed freshly picked, before the sugars convert to starches so, if in doubt, I’d recommend going for frozen instead. It’s well worth the happy labour if you do find them really fresh, though – plus you get to eat some of the peas as you go.Roughly chop the spring onions, white and green parts alike, discarding only the tough tops. A couple of shallots, or a small white onion, finely chopped, will stand in for the spring onions if that’s all you have to hand. And chop the bacon, too, if using – I’d recommend it if you eat pork, because the savoury flavour is an excellent partner for the sweetness of the peas.Heat the butter in a large pan over a medium-low flame. (Alternatively, use oil if you want to make a vegan soup – the grassy flavour of rapeseed should work well.) Add the bacon and spring onions, and sweat gently until the onions are soft and the bacon begins to release its fat try not to let it colour.Add the peas and the reserved pods, if using, to the pan, stir to coat them in the fat, then pour in the water. If you aren’t using bacon, you may wish to use vegetable stock instead, because the soup could probably do with the extra boost of flavour. Bring to a boil, then simmer until the peas are really tender (about 10 minutes, depending on their size).Turn off the heat, fish out and discard the pods and leave the soup to cool slightly. Use a food processor or hand blender to puree the mix until smooth – if you realise belatedly that you’ve missed a pod, it’s not a disaster, but you may wish to sieve the soup after blending, to extract any particularly fibrous bits before serving.Stir in the lemon juice, taste and season accordingly: depending on the freshness of the peas, you may well feel the need to add a pinch of sugar as well as the usual salt and pepper if you’re serving the soup warm, a tiny pinch of nutmeg wouldn’t go amiss, either, although that’s strictly optional.If the soup’s a little thick for your liking, add a dash of water – it’s particularly important that this soup is silky if you’re planning to serve it cold. If not, reheat and spoon into bowls. Or chill it well – cold soups ought to be cold, not room temperature. (Note that this is also a great soup to take on a picnic.)Whatever temperature you’re serving it, this soup is even more delicious with a swirl of creme fraiche and a little chopped mint. You might also consider some finely chopped crispy bacon, crumbled goat’s cheese or feta, a pinch of chilli flakes or some flaked hot smoked salmon and chopped dill or chives – or even sorrel, if you can get hold of it.To make croutons to go with this soup, thinly slice half a baguette and arrange on an oven tray lined with baking paper. Drizzle with olive oil and bake at 200C390Fgas 6 for about 10 minutes, until just golden. If you really want to push the boat out, top each crouton with crumbled soft goat’s cheese, and return to the oven until melted and bubbling.

If confirmed by the Senate, Pack would replace current CEO John Lansing, who was appointed in 2015.While the BBG may not be a household name, the $685m agency wields significant international influence through its news networks including Office of Cuba Broadcasting, Radio Free Asia, Voice of America, and Middle East Broadcasting Networks. These government-funded outlets create and distribute news in more than 100 countries and 61 languages, reaching an audience of 278 million people.In 2014, Jeff Shell, then chairman of the BBG, took umbrage with an article in Time which seemed to suggest the agency is analogous to the Kremlin-run Russia Today. Shell and wrote an op-ed stressing BBG’s “founding legislation mandates that our programs be conducted in accordance with the highest professional standards of broadcast journalism”.Pack’s nomination as head of the BBG has reportedly been in the works for over a year, but was delayed while he removed himself from conflict of interest issues.Pack has a long history in the media and disseminating conservative ideas. He was previously head of the Claremont Institute, a conservative thinktank, where he also presided over the Claremont Review of Books, which has been described as the “bible of highbrow Trumpism”. Its editor, Charles Kesler, has called Trump’s election “a liberating moment for conservatism”.Previously, Pack served on the National Council of the National Endowment for Humanities and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. He is also a documentary filmmaker and the president of Manifold Productions, an independent film and television production company. Pack worked on two documentaries with Steve Bannon one about nuclear power and one about the Iraq war.Last year, Pack wrote an article for the Federalist that praised Steve Bannon, and professed his desire that Bannon would help break the left’s “monopoly” on documentaries. Pack argued that film departments in American universities are a hotbed of liberal “indoctrination and grooming.”“I have some bad news for this documentary establishment,” Pack wrote. “Trump, with Bannon’s help, campaigned against political correctness and self-dealing elites. And they won.”If Pack does become head of the BBG, critics fear that he will turn Voice of America and the other BBG networks into a megaphone for Trump. This is of particular concern because the new head of the BBG will have more unilateral power than previous leaders. Towards the end of the Obama administration, a provision was enacted which would replace BBG’s bipartisan board with an advisory board elected by the president. While some people saw the move as a way to make the BBG more efficient, others worry that it might imperil its journalistic independence.When conducted by the  about his nomination, Pack said that he is honored to be asked to serve his country in this important position, but has no further comment at this point."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc2e43cf4d360c84154056f1bac14e06ef0d70ef/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67ac72b689d474d847f99f5ffa19dd41","title":"mps urge home secretary to review right to rent policy","story":"Cross-party group says there has been no assessment of impact of immigration schemeA cross-party group of MPs has written to the home secretary urging a review of a controversial immigration policy forcing landlords to check whether tenants are legally allowed to rent, saying there has been no proper assessment of its impact.The group, comprising MPs from Labour, the Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Greens, told Sajid Javid that the “right to rent” scheme, part of the wider hostile environment approach, needed reassessment following the Windrush scandal.Since 2014 landlords have been required to carry out “reasonable enquiries” as to whether would-be tenants are in the UK legitimately. A subsequent law created an offence of knowingly leasing a property to a disqualified person, with a maximum jail term of five years.One of the many problems faced by people caught up in the Windrush scandal has been the inability to find anywhere to live when they cannot prove their immigration status.The letter, whose signatories include Diane Abbott, Harriet Harman, Joanna Cherry, Ben Lake, Caroline Lucas and Tom Brake, cited a report from March on the right to rent scheme by the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration (ICIBI), David Bolt.The report found right to rent “had yet to demonstrate its worth as a tool to encourage immigration compliance”, Bolt said, making a series of recommendations for change.The letter noted that the ICIBI “was particularly concerned with the lack of any monitoring or evaluation mechanisms that would allow the government to ascertain whether the scheme was having its intended effect, or whether it is creating unintended consequences”.It said the government had refused to implement one of his recommendations – an improved landlords’ consultative panel – and had seemed unwilling to properly monitor the effect of the scheme.“The Windrush scandal has drawn attention to the effects of the so-called hostile environment,” the letter said. “It also provides a stark warning of the consequences that can be expected when ministers and officials fail to respond to the repeated warnings of experts about the impact of their policies.”While the best option would be to immediately end the scheme, the letter said, at the very least ministers should commit to evaluating it properly, particularly how it might make people homeless, or at risk of modern slavery and trafficking.It ended: “We therefore ask that you implement the recommendations set out by the ICIBI as a matter of urgency.”A Home Office spokesman said: “The term ‘hostile environment’ as a description of Home Office immigration policy is incorrect, unhelpful and does not represent our values as a country. “We noted the Independent Chief Inspectors’ recommendations on the right to rent scheme and we continue to take steps to ensure it is implemented and communicated as effectively as possible. “The Home Office engaged extensively with a variety of groups prior to the roll out of the right to rent scheme and it has been subject to evaluation, which found no evidence that the scheme was causing unlawful discrimination, homelessness or additional burdens on local authorities.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e12d619320b61e2d15bde448251e7bdca6802f08/0_173_5350_3210/master/5350.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a289ac2550d56b173270e43c430a40f","title":"nut allergy british airways served cashews lax response","story":"My daughter and I have severe nut allergies and have both been hospitalised after touching a work surface where nuts had been present. When my family flew with British Airways recently, I told the airline when booking and at each stage of the journey. Despite this, it served some of my family cashews on both the outward and return flights.The nuts were listed on the in-house allergen sheet outbound but not on the return flight. BA’s response has been lax. In one email it advised against contacting its catering department since it would not change the outcome of my complaint. It has offered 100,000 Avios (reward points) per passenger by way of an apology but I’m loth to accept it as I feel that its failures need highlighting. PL, Leighton BuzzardBA seems unable to grasp that contact with a cashew could have been fatal. In a delayed initial response to you, a customer relations operative merely stated that it must have been “frustrating” to have been served “a different meal to the one you were expecting”, and that menus sometimes have to be changed at the last minute for “operational reasons”.It said that while it does not serve peanut products on board, it does not categorise tree nuts as allergens and apologised for “any inconvenience”. It told the Observer: “The safety and welfare of customers is always our priority … we have comprehensive policies to ensure the welfare of any customers with allergies and provide our caterers with strict guidelines.”However, all airlines decide their own policies. Some refuse to ban peanuts and none guarantee a nut-free environment. Allergy UK, which carried out a survey after several similar incidents were reported last year, says that what has become clear is the lack of consistency. “We believe there would be major challenges in enforcing a nut ban effectively,” it says. “Our aim is that airlines educate both crews and passengers about the challenges passengers with allergies face when they fly. We are keen to help them develop more clear and consistent procedures, including training crew to administer emergency adrenaline.”If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

Also done in French as sister recording Damn, Dis-Moi, Girlfriend is set to HD 80s boogie production – redolent of the guest star Dam-Funk, who delivers some deep, sexy vocal interjections.In a very strong month for rap albums, what with A$AP Rocky’s impressionistically blunted Testing and Pusha T’s Kanye-produced side of beef Daytona both proving excellent, Playboi Carti’s newest full-length, Die Lit, still stood out. His hopscotching flow broke through on Magnolia last year, and that track’s producer, Pi’erre Bourne, is the key to the album’s hazy appeal. For Fell In Luv, he cuts up a sample of a sample – Purity Ring’s lift of Young Magic – to end up with something Holly Herndon might make if she segued into mumble-rap production.Recent months have seen the 1975’s frontman Matty Healy credited with inspiring a spuriously named genre called Healywave (though he prefers Mattycore). To be fair, he has worked with most of the acts connected with it – his Dirty Hit labelmates Pale Waves and No Rome – and to be even fairer, it should probably be called Hutchencewave for its clear debt to INXS. Still, technicalities: no sooner had the term started catching on (sort of) than the 1975 return with a completely new sound. The first track from their third album hooks around a single, strangulated riff that sounds a bit like Room on Fire-era Strokes rendered as a polyphonic ringtone. It’s miles better than that suggests, and completely unlike anything else on the radio. Like always, Healy’s lyrics veer between ludicrous and devoutly sincere, touching on STDs, finding grey hairs in your “zoot” (zoot!) and an impressively self-lacerating description of himself as “a millennial that baby boomers like”. As neurotic as the song is, Healy suggests being kinder to yourself as you grow up the strangely affecting Give Yourself a Try is a sign of the 1975 letting themselves grow in weird and wonderful ways.Speaking of Healywave, there’s definitely a touch of the 1975 in the muted guitar that chimes through the second chorus of Troye Sivan’s excellent single Bloom. But most of this glorious ode to bottoming shimmers by on synths that channel the sense of anticipation and nervousness that Sivan conveys as he plays the part of a receptive partner losing his virginity. It’s stylishly done stuff: his voice on the tantalising first verse is coated in whispery reverb, an invitation to come closer, while the choruses are peppered with subtle gasps that imbue the elegant Bloom with an indecently good sense of lust.It seems far too long since Tirzah’s brief run of brilliance in the mid-2010s – not least the brilliantly scruffy I’m Not Dancing. Similarly earwormy is Gladly, the first single from her long-awaited debut album Devotion (out this August on Domino). Produced by Mica Levi, the track lopes sleepily around a single loop, a heavy, warped piano refrain that seems to pace around in circles and mirrors Tirzah’s state of mind. “All I want is you,” she repeats, drowsy with longing and obsession: “I love you.” Proof that the simplest songs are sometimes the most profound.It’s been a banner month for the Tottenham MC. Not only has he guested on standout tracks on the aforementioned Playboi Carti and A$AP Rocky albums – appearing on stage with the latter and a giant crash test dummy head in London – he has also released one of his strongest solo tracks ever. Over a minimalist beat that perfectly encapsulates the way he currently straddles grime and US rap, Pure Water sees him announce his own greatness with armour-plated self-confidence.Thirty-four years ago, Prophet self-released 1,000 copies of Right on Time, an album of scuffed, wonky but compelling electro-funk that disappeared without trace. But it was coveted by Stones Throw label head Peanut Butter Wolf, who met with Prophet and got him in the studio to finally do the follow-up. Tonight is a rerecorded version of a track from his debut, which was covered by Nite Jewel in 2011, who turns up here to join in the homecoming: a magnificent, stumbling funk jam. Nite Jewel – one of the most underrated songwriters around today – has her own track on the playlist too, On Your Own, a Hi-NRG synth workout topped with a soaring vocal.The Brooklyn garage rockers keep knocking out classic after classic, with new LP Wide Awake! another essential collection of varied, literate, totally satisfying jams. One highlight, Freebird II – the title typical of their droll hipster humour – features a big, satisfying organ melody matched by a blokey singalong for the chorus. Andrew Savage’s verses are like a positivist spin on those from Human Performance, the title lament from the band’s last album.Miss Red was born in Israel to Moroccan-Polish parents but, with her girlish patois, she sounds more like she was brought up in a Kingston ghetto. Pairing her once more with producer the Bug, who she accosted at a Tel Aviv rave and went on to tour and record with, Dagga is the first track from her debut album. One of the Bug’s hallmark industrial-dancehall riddims rides under Miss Red’s coquettish singsong vocals.Fresh from a brilliant score for the Robert Pattison thriller Good Time, and following a string of albums of densely splintered electronics, Daniel Lopatin has released an ambitious new record in Age Of. It finds space for drunken harpsichords, Anohni, terrifying shouting, tender Bon Iver-style digital songcraft, harsh trap and jazzy synth solos, and yet hangs together: he is the great sonic essayist of our voracious, always-on culture. The highlight is the symphonic Toys 2, his biggest, cheesiest moment yet, and his most moving."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56d6c8161bc92d6487a0fdd17730324d52c0fa2d/0_284_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5fab0b8a4a4d1e36cde8ffcf99b916a","title":"the the review royal albert hall london","story":"Royal Albert Hall, LondonPerforming for the first time in 16 years only days after his father’s death, 1980s indie hero Matt Johnson retains a gravel-voiced gravitasMost returning artists are allergic to the notion that they are making a comeback, preferring to parrot the line that they have never really been away. Such reticence does not remotely affect Matt Johnson and the The, who have named their current UK and US tour the Comeback Special. Then again, it would be hard for Johnson to deny the extent of his recent indolence. The The’s last live gig was at a David Bowie-curated Meltdown in 2002, since when they have released the sum total of two singles, while Johnson has sporadically made music for film soundtracks and art installations.This high-pressure return is rendered more difficult by the death of Johnson’s father four days earlier, with the singer confessing online that only “massive financial implications” have prevented him from cancelling these shows. The standing ovation as he dedicates the gigs to his dad indicates mass empathy and support.The The have always been a vehicle for Johnson, who began his career in 1979 writing songs of intense personal turmoil before shifting his gaze to global geopolitics. The latter material dominates the first half tonight, with songs such as 1989 single The Beat(en) Generation wrapping their political message in the velvet glove of a gorgeous melody. The twitchy Johnson retains a gravel-voiced gravitas, and his band are taut and kinetic on barbed missiles such as Armageddon Days Are Here (Again). Yet the earnest social-commentary material can pall, and it’s not until the The dip into Soul Mining, the 1982 album that Johnson wrote as a callow youth, that the crowd rise from their seats as one.With its fragile synthpop essays that sound like precocious teenage diary entries, the album was a masterclass in adolescent angst, and the rapt This Is the Day reunites tonight’s largely middle-aged audience with their inner Adrian Moles. The sublime encore, the halting 1982 single Uncertain Smile, remains the essence of youthful infatuation. The The really shouldn’t leave it 16 years until their next tour.At Brixton Academy, London, on 6 June. Box office: 0844 477 2000.

May refused to give an answer when asked by Jeremy Corbyn at prime minister’s questions when it would be published.Rumours were circulating in Westminster on Wednesday that Davis had threatened to resign over the details of the backstop plan.A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.Britain signed up to the idea of a backstop in the deal reached with the EU27 in December but May rejected a draft subsequently presented by Brussels that would in effect keep Northern Ireland in the single market.Any plan that involves a special status for Northern Ireland is anathema to May’s allies in the Democratic Unionist party, who reject the idea of any differential in treatment between the region and the rest of the UK.The EU27 has been waiting for the government to publish its alternative draft backstop proposal, which is expected to include the whole of the UK temporarily applying the EU’s external tariff – a plan that would limit the ability of the trade secretary, Liam Fox, to strike new deals with non-EU countries."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b6279cd4a6d3deffbb1fe8f82e1ce3637ad3e3c/0_0_2583_1550/master/2583.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07d609b4e66214f457d5d431d9ca0732","title":"pmqs verdict corbyn notches up another solid win on brexit","story":"What was supposedly once a key Theresa May issue has now turned toxic for the PM Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn pay tribute to those killed in the London Bridge terror attack and the emergency services.Corbyn asks if the government’s Brexit white paper will be published before the debate next week.May says the government wants to publish a white paper going beyond speeches and papers published so far. She says it will be an ambitious offer to be negotiated with the EU.Corbyn says his question was simple: when will it be published? Next week MPs will debate the most important legislation for a long time. He asks if the white paper will be published ahead of the June EU summit.May says next week’s votes will be important. They will be about implementing Brexit. She says, if Corbyn wants to talk about clarity, he should stand up and rule out a second referendum.Corbyn says the last time he looked it said prime minister’s questions. He says the government said this white paper would set out the government’s vision. Yet it is nowhere to be seen.He asks which of the sub-committees looking at the “max fac” and customs partnership plans have met, and when people will find out what they have decided.May says she did not ask a question. She just challenged him to stand up and say what Labour policy was on a second referendum. She urges him to rule it out.Corbyn says it is not the opposition that is conducting the negotiations. And it is not the government doing it either. He asks if a 10-mile buffer zone in Northern Ireland is now government policy.May says the government wants to ensure there is no hard border between the UK and Ireland. It continues to negotiate with the EU. She says the debate next week is important. It will show the sincerity of this house on leaving the EU.Corbyn says May has given no answer on the white paper and no answer on the buffer zone. But that plan has united people in Ireland. They say it is bonkers.Is it her plan to complete the transition by December 2020? Yes, says May.Corbyn says Damian Green, the former first secretary of state, said there would be a transition after the transition. He says the government has delivered more delays and cancellations on Brexit than Northern rail. He says the government’s incompetence threatens communities. What will last longer – the Northern rail franchise or her premiership?May says if Corbyn won’t speak about his Brexit policy, she will. Keir Starmer said Labour was not united on this. She says Labour has sought to frustrate Brexit on every stage. Labour is refusing to deliver Brexit. This government is delivering on it, she says.It is hard to believe now that May called a general election last year because she thought her stance on Brexit would help her win a thumping victory over Jeremy Corbyn and Labour. What was supposedly a key May issue has now turned toxic, to the extent that Corbyn has yet again notched up a solid PMQs win on the topic, seemingly quite effortlessly. He did so by the simple expedient of asking when the government’s Brexit white paper would be published.May was able to give a clear, straight answer to Corbyn’s question about the end of the transition (although it probably won’t turn out to be an accurate answer – many people think there will eventually be a post-transition transition), and she could probably have answered the 10-mile buffer zone question (sources says it’s a non-starter). But she was flailing on the white paper, and it matters because her failure to say when it will be published illustrates the government’s inability to answer crucial questions about its negotiating stance. May fought back by challenging Corbyn to rule out a second Brexit referendum, and by taunting him over what Keir Starmer said about Labour party isions. But these felt like second-order and largely irrelevant issues, and she could not disguise the fact that Corbyn’s criticisms were spot-on.If he wants to talk about clarity … he should stand up and rule out a second referendum.When it comes to Brexit, this government has delivered more delays and more cancellations than Northern rail … Which will last longer – the Northern rail franchise or her premiership?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5fb4849da495c469e313528dc415f79ad44efe1/409_580_1976_1186/master/1976.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69a193f042bf5571030b3c107d0a4846","title":"theresa may israel iran nuclear deal benjamin netanyahu","story":"PM tells Benjamin Netanyahu that Britain still backs deal, and raises issue of Palestinian deathsIsrael’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has pressed Theresa May to recognise that the Iranian nuclear deal is on the point of collapse and that a fresh plan is needed to stop Iran restarting its uranium enrichment programme.Netanyahu met May on Wednesday following his talks this week with the other European supporters of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel. Netanyahu has lobbied for European leaders to follow the example of the US president, Donald Trump, and pull out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on Iran.“But we do recognise that there are other issues that need to be addressed in relation to Iran – its destabilising regional activity in countries like Syria and Yemen and also the the proliferation of ballistic missiles.” Netanyahu told May he was focused on making sure Iran did not get a nuclear weapon and on “how to roll back Iran’s aggression in the region”. The European signatories are scrambling to save the accord, which they see as crucial to forestalling an Iranian nuclear weapon. However, the US president has said the deal is deeply flawed.The Israeli pressure is designed not only to back Trump’s decision to pull out of the deal but also to force European firms to disinvest from Iran.May also raised the subject of the UN’s call for an independent inquiry into the killing of dozens of Palestinian protesters on the day the US moved its embassy to Jerusalem.May stressed she recognised Israel’s right to self-defence but called on Netanyahu to act to alleviate the situation. The Israeli prime minister insisted the protests were driven by the militant group Hamas and that the response was aimed at minimising causalities. Rival groups of protesters gathered outside Downing Street waving Palestinian and Israeli flags before Netanyahu’s arrival. On Tuesday, Iran said it had ordered preparations for increasing uranium enrichment capacity in case the nuclear agreement collapsed. It also announced it had completed a new centrifuge assembly centre at the Natanz nuclear site.The finance ministers and foreign secretaries of the UK, Germany and France have jointly written to their US counterparts seeking assurances that the US will not impose secondary sanctions on EU firms operating in Iran. Their letter says that JCPOA is “the best means through which we can prevent a nuclear armed Iran”.Speaking in France ahead of his meeting with May, Netanyahu was confident that the EU firms operating in Iran would not be able to resist US sanctions.Several big companies, including France’s Total and the Netherlands’ Maersk, have already said it would be impossible to stay in Iran once sanctions were fully reimposed over the next six months, unless they received explicit exemptions from Washington."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ffea78a11ef5677c3794f8ea33475fc0924bcb9/0_92_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e832973dedc0b3b9804012b1dab3c48d","title":"pmqs brexit starmer says labour wont back staying in eea because party too divided politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs and David Davis’s Brexit speechDavis says is is optimistic about Brexit.When I look at the relationship between the UK and the twenty seven remaining members of the EU, there are reasons to be optimistic. And I make no apologies for being so. Our interests are so aligned that the only threats come not from deliberate action, but from what we fail to do. But he says the Brexit talks could fail by accident.The primary risk in these negotiations is now one of accident.That due to a lack of ambition — by resting on third country precedents — we miscalculate somehow. And the cost of that miscalculation is a deal that is unacceptable to both sides. That lets down the citizens we are so keen to protect. Now is the time to redouble our efforts, and open our minds once again. To build an enduring new partnership between the closest of friends and allies. Davis says the UK wants Brexit to be “as smooth and orderly as possible”.We have chosen right from the beginning to recognise the specific responsibilities that lie with us, as the party choosing to leave.And that is why we are putting forward practical solutions to the obstacles that might otherwise undermine the long-lasting, deep and special partnership we want with the EU.One that respects the institutional architecture of the European Union, and the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom.Here is the key quote so far.It’s sometimes said that the limits of our cooperation have been set by the United Kingdom.That on leaving the European Union — and not being under the jurisdiction of the ECJ — there will be an automatic drop in security cooperation.That we are the only one with a choice.The European Union does have choices.And when I see the positions proposed by the Commission, I see choices being taken there.Ones which lean towards the protection of legal precedents, above operational capability. Davis says the UK wants a comprehensive, deep partnership with the EU on a whole range of matters relating to security.He says the UK has always seen the EU differently. That is why people voted to leave, but confident in the knowledge that they would be able to carry on cooperating afterwards.This is from ITV’s Robert Peston.Davis is now speaking about Galileo.The UK has been instrumental in its design.But now the EU is claiming that UK involvement, as a third country, would put the scheme at risk - even though shutting out the UK could delay the project by three years, he says.He says this amounts to shooting oneself if the foot just to prove the gun works.He says relying on “dogmatic precedents” does not help anyone.The UK is proposing a collaborative approach, he says.Europe’s security is the UK’ security, he says.Davis says the UK and the EU must act quickly to avoid there being a gap in operational capability after Brexit.The UK has offered to maintain current levels of cooperation.But if that is not accepted, safety will be put at risk.He says the UK made a choice it would not do anything to undermine European security, he says.He says the UK has put forward serious options for the future security partnership.He says it is sometimes said there will be an automatic drop in security cooperation after Brexit. He does not accept that, he says. He says the EU has chosen to prioritise legal integrity over the benefits of cooperation.He says he wants to concentrate on one aspect of the new partnership the UK wants with the EU after Brexit - that is, the need for the partnership to stand the test of time.That is why they UK has avoided briefing against the EU, he says. It wants to ensure the two sides can have a relationship of trust after Brexit.He says the new relationship should not ignore the decades of trust and collaboration that has existed for years.Cooperation has kept the peace and kept people secure.He says the UK does not need to be in the EU for that cooperation to continue.But it does need trust, he says.Anyone who doubts that does not know their British history, he says.These are from the Times’ Sam Coates.These are from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg.And this is from my colleague Pippa Crerar.David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is about to give his speech on Brexit and security.Bruce asks Javid what he thinks of these stories.Javid starts by quoting the note Paulette Wilson wrote on a paper on one of her files: “Please help me, this is my home.”He says he can look at this with “a new set of eyes” as someone new to the job. He goes on:He says the system put the entire burden of proof on the inidual.And it is not set up for those with deemed leave to be in the country, he says.No one with deemed leave would have had a reason to keep documentation proving they had the right to be here, he says.He says the Home Office is doing a full “lessons learnt” review.He says there are now more than 150 people in various locations working to help people from the Windrush generation.And a “Windrush scheme” has been set up, he says. That means iniduals just have to fill in one form. Previously people had to use a specific application, depending on what route they were using to get approval to remain in the UK. They might have applied via the wrong route, he says. Now they will just use the one form, and a case worker will then decide what procedure applies best, he says.Fiona Bruce asks about Paulette Wilson. Wilson came to the UK as a 10-year-old. She spent some time in a children’ s home. There were 35 years of national insurance records. And medical records too. Yet she was detained. Why?Williams says Wilson first applied to the Home Office in 2003.He says the Home Office took the view that she was not entitled to be in the UK. That was wrong, he says. She was entitled to be here because of the 1971 Immigration Act.He says, because Wilson did not apply on a NTL (no time limit) form, the Home Office did not get to see all the evidence she had to back up her case. That is where it went wrong. She must have felt she was being asked to comply with legalistic and bureaucratic requirements.Here is the story my colleague Amelia Gentelman wrote about Wilson in November last year.Turning away from the committee hearing for a moment, this is from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg.Glyn Williams, a Home Office director general, is answering questions alongside Javid. He says he is charge of immigration policy, and is coordinating the response to “the Windrush scandal” (his phrase, not mine.)Williams says he only saw the Bryan case file yesterday.Bryan applied for the right to remain. Williams says officials took the view that he had not proved that he had been in the country for 20 years to their satisfaction.The Conservative MP Fiona Bruce asks about Anthony Bryan. With all the information available to the Home Office about how long he had been in the country, how did he end up being detained?My colleague Amelia Gentleman told Bryan’s story in this article published in December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fc6c548136e0c938246635f57b2cd648027b528/0_61_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fcb354174c9b266d9270315e9fd8d1c","title":"french open quarter finals muguruza sharapova nadal halep kerber del potro cilic live","story":"The rain is getting stronger. Perhaps Schwartzman is distracted because he falls break point down having been 40-0 up. A looping Nadal forehand is there to be hit, Schwartzman swats it cross-court, and Nadal can’t get that back into court. Deuce. Nadal is having to work so hard to finish Schwartzman off in these rallies, eventually the Spaniard settles matters at the net. Nadal’s advantage. A wild and wayward backhand from Schwartzman and Nadal breaks back. Could this be the turning point?Sacré bleu! It’s just got even more interesting on Chatrier, because Nadal blazes into the tramlines to go break point down. Again, Nadal hits wide. Schwartzman leads Nadal, 83-2 at the French Open, by a set and a break, I repeat Schwartzman leads Nadal by a set and a break.More on the women’s quarter-finals:It’s hard to take your eyes off this, but what of Cilic v Del Potro? Eight games on the board and 37 minutes in, there hasn’t been a break of serve.It’s raining. But not pouring. So they’re carrying on. Nadal is grimacing at deuce. A 14th forehand winner from Schwartzman and it’s his advantage. Make that Jeu Schwartzman. Schwartzman has been superb so far but can he sustain this over a best-of-five set match? And remember, only two players have ever beaten Nadal here: Robin Soderling in 2009 and Novak Djokovic in 2015. Winning a set against Nadal at Roland Garros is one thing defeating Nadal is quite another. Nadal holds at the start of the second set, the only blot on his service game is a double fault. Nadal’s left wrist is being taped by the trainer. Make that the right too. Given they both are, that suggests there isn’t an injury. But there’s no doubt he’s hurting right now. The spectator is helped out of the stadium and they’re back under way. The pair trade cross-court blows before Schwartzman changes tack with a thunderbolt down the line! Did it go in? Yes! Nadal’s run of 37 consecutive sets at Roland Garros is over! It’s the first set he’s lost here since 2015.... not that they’ve played it yet, because the tournament doctor is helping someone in the crowd. Nadal remains on court, while Schwartzman has gone back to his chair. So Diego, this is your moment. 15-0. A deft volley from Schwartzman and it’s 30-0. Schwartzman steps in with the court at his mercy – and he batters the net! 30-15. He makes no mistakes with the short ball this time, 40-15. Two set points for the Argentinian. I didn’t think I’d be writing that this afternoon. Schwartzman goes for broke on the forehand and it whistles long. 40-30. Nadal grazes the baseline with his backhand before throwing in a drop-shot. Nerveless. Schwartzman again puts a little too much on his forehand. Break point Nadal. But a Nadal error followed by a Schwartzman smash and here’s a third set point ...And would you believe it, Schwartzman leads 30-40 on the Nadal serve, with the chance to break Nadal for the third time. Nadal sweeps the clay off the baseline with his foot, wipes his face before sending his first serve into the net. He lands his second but his second shot of the point is too short – and Schwartzman strikes with another winner! He’ll serve for the first set! Nadal has requested the trainer but he won’t be receiving any medical attention straight away, Schwartzman will serve for a set to love lead first.Marin Cilic and Juan Martin del Potro are just getting under way on Lenglen, and it’s a big match in many ways: both players stand at 6ft 6in, both are big hitters and both are in the form of their life on clay. They haven’t met on the surface since the 2012 French Open. Del Potro dominated that match, as he has in all four of their clay-court encounters.Nadal has won 37 consecutive sets at Roland Garros. Could the record be under threat? How dare we doubt him, because he’s got two break-back points on Schwartzman’s serve and he isn’t in the mood to let them go. He breaks back immediately to restore parity.Here’s a helpful Greg Phillips. “I have always wondered about ‘quarante a’ too but never bothered to look it up until now. Unfortunately the French rules listed on the International Tennis Federation just describe the rule (That the score should never be announced as quarante-a after the first time that score is reached) without explaining it. That said, since egalite means equally, I suppose it’s just a way of saying that after one player had an advantage, they are back on level terms in the game. Doesn’t explain the disparity between languages though, since I’ve never heard an English-speaking umpire say ‘forty all’.”Meanwhile plenty of ooohs and aaaahs on Chatrier where Schwartzman, up 15-40 on Nadal’s serve, is pushing and pushing ... a probing forehand ... Nadal just about gets it back ... Schwartzman comes to the net ... and there’s the break! There’s no time to rest my aching fingers though, because it’s time to talk about Rafa. Natural order has been restored, with Nadal breaking back before holding for 3-2. It’s not often you’d see him changing his shirt five games into a match but this has been a right old tussle they’ve been going for nearly 40 minutes already in the bright sunshine. Schwartzman isn’t holding back, he’s up to 11 winners compared to Nadal’s two – most of those have been won not through sheer power but craft. Make that 13 winners, as Schwartzman holds to love.So it’ll be Halep v Muguruza tomorrow. Sloane Stephens and Madison Keys meet in the other semi-final, in a repeat of last year’s US Open final. Only Muguruza has won the French Open title before.Nadal will have to wait though, because Halep looks to be putting the finishing touches on a three-set win over Kerber. The world No 1 leads 5-2, with Kerber saving to stay in the match. Kerber wins the first point, and puts away a wonderful forehand on the second. 30-0. Why wasn’t she hitting so aggressively earlier in this set? The more cautious Kerber makes a reappearance and it’s 30-all. Will it be match point or game point? Match point, after Kerber dumps into the net. Kerber overcooks a forehand and it’s game, set, match Halep! She’ll be extremely relieved to get through the decider so easily after their tussle in Melbourne earlier this year. Mon dieu! Schwartzman has broken Nadal’s serve on Chatrier. Another break for Halep. At 4-1, she’s potentially two games away from her third French Open semi-final. But she doesn’t like doing it the easy way. She’s broken to 15.Nadal, having been inconvenienced on his own serve, is inconveniencing Schwartzman on his. It’s the latter who eventually holds. They’ve been playing 18 minutes and it’s only 1-1.Meanwhile on Lenglen, Halep, having led 2-0 in the decider, has been broken and is serving at 2-1. There’s something about Halep and three-set matches, the masochist. She just can’t resist putting herself through them. She’s such a wonderful player who has often blinked in the biggest moments in the past, and she’d be a popular champion here after going so close in 2014 and 2017. Halep has break point at 30-40 – but her forehand flies beyond the baseline.Nadal check list. The jumping up and down at the net during the coin toss? Check. The bull-like charge to the baseline as if to say: “I’m ready. And I’m going to grind you into the dirt”? Check. The lining up of his bottles? Check. So let’s play. Nadal is serving first ... but Schwartzman clearly hasn’t read the script. The Argentinian has not one, not two, not three but four opportunities to break – before Nadal eventually holds after a 10-minute struggle. He allows himself a little fist pump, as well he might after that early battle. Nadal has won all his five of his previous meetings with Schwartzman. Ever the gentleman, he said of his opponent: “It’s always good to see him in the quarter-final because he’s a good friend, a good person. He’s a worker, and I’m happy to see him having all this success.” Ever the competitor, he then qualified that with: “Hopefully not too much.”And here is Rafa. On paper this could be more one-sided than the first semi-final on Chatrier – it’s the 10-times champion and world No 1 against the diminutive Argentinian Diego Schwartzman, who is playing his first quarter-final at Roland Garros. But the 5ft 7in Schwartzman is a hard worker – as proven but he fact he’s climbed to No 12 in the world in a game populated by players nearly a foot taller. And he’s not afraid to run. And run. And run.The world No 1 is flying. 0-15. 0-30. 0-40. Three set points. The first goes begging, as does the second, after two unforced errors. The pair engage in a lengthy rally on the third, and Halep goes long! From three set points to deuce. But Halep gets a chance to make amends at her advantage. Kerber misses her first serve ... and meekly nets her second! They’re going to a decider. This could be like that crazy Australian Open contest all over again. After a quick mid-game comfort break from your game-by-gamer (the perils of attempting to cover two matches simultaneously), Halep is in a spot of bother, break point down. 30-40. But Kerber is slamming her racket into the red dirt when Halep hustles her way to advantage. Halep doesn’t take that one but no bother, here’s another game point. Halep displays tremendous athleticism to sprint to a drop-shot, before dinking the ball over for the winner. Wow. Halep holds and Kerber must serve to stay in the second set.Halep holds. Keber holds. But a more pressing issue. “Hi Katy,” emails James Taylor. “Thanks for the live reports. Something has been bugging me that I’m hoping you or one of your readers can clear up- why do the umpires say ‘Quarante a’ when a game first goes to deuce but ‘Egalite’ thereafter? Is it just the French being awkward or is there a more concrete reason behind it?” Hmmm. Je ne sais pas. Anyone? Terrific from Muguruza but terrifically disappointing from Sharapova. That had been billed as the potential blockbuster of the day. Let’s see what Rafa can do next on Chatrier. Meanwhile, it’s “game on” over on Lenglen, where Halep leads by a break in the second set, 3-2, having surrendered the first on a tie-break.A penny for Serena Williams’s thoughts right now. She was, of course, due to play Sharapova in the previous round but had to withdraw through injury. Muguruza holds to 15 so, only 67 minutes after play started, Sharapova is serving to stay in the contest. Even the Gods are against the Russian, and she loses out on a net cord. 0-15. Which all took quickly turns into 0-30. Sharapova, all too aware of the hole she’s in, takes a little longer on her already very long serving routine. It works. 15-30. But it’s a brief reprieve. 15-40, two match points. The first comes and goes. Cue a customary steely Sharapova glare. Sharapova lands her second serve but it’s gobbled up by Muguruza, and Sharapova isn’t getting that back into play! Muguruza, the 2016 champion, has overwhelmed the 2012 and 2014 winner to reach the semi-finals! After a nervy start from the Spaniard, that was virtually flawless tennis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1383677c935039410cfe4055a783e1197836b612/0_93_4450_2670/master/4450.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=596dd32842ec97ab0cc8dffaf769ad5f","title":"uber launches electric bike sharing service germany","story":"Move is part of firm’s efforts to patch up its relationship with European governmentsUber has launched an electric bike-sharing service in Germany as part of efforts to repair its relationship with European governments.The controversial ride-hailing app has been prohibited from operating some of its services in Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Belgium, after battles with taxi organisations and protests in several cities.Scores of German taxi drivers waved banners reading “Uber go home” outside the conference centre where Dara Khosrowshahi, the Uber chief executive, presented the company’s Jump scheme in Berlin on Wednesday.Khosrowshahi said Uber hoped to reset its relationship with German legislators.“We had a very bad start in Germany,” he said, arriving on stage with one of the red bikes. “We’re here now in order to try again.”“I want this to signal a deep commitment to Germany ... We want to work with local governments and cities and make our model work,” he said.Uber has been aggressively expanding into Europe since 2014, but clampdowns by courts across Europe have followed angry protests by traditional taxi drivers while many city authorities, including London, have accused the company of increasing congestion in urban areas.In Germany, Uber is only active in Berlin and Munich.Jump is due to be rolled out fully in Berlin by the end of the summer and will launch in further European cities over the coming year. It is already operating in San Francisco and Washington.Khosrowshahi said he believed Uber could help Germany tackle some of its major transport challenges, including air pollution, congestion and the search for affordable greener mobility solutions.He also told the conference the company had been damaged by reports that it had allowed a sexist and chauvinist culture to flourish. “I didn’t have to convince the company that the macho culture was wrong. Everyone at the company knew it,” said Khosrowshahi, who joined Uber last August.One of the biggest challenges Uber will face in Berlin is finding space for its bikes, after a number of firms from China and the US entered the market in the last year, competing with existing local initiatives. Authorities are struggling to cope with where to place the bikes, many of which clutter pavements or are thrown into rivers and scrubland."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55454bd93efd6e312368e906ef13793b41c0c943/0_249_1892_1135/master/1892.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f3e6c2e0f5d878b2767a13752682228","title":"20 great uk ireland beach cottages summer holidays 2018","story":"The beach is a pebble’s throw from the doorstep of these stylish, self-catering holiday homes.

Last week the show started exploring another dimension, with 500 classic episodes live-streamed in a viewing marathon on Twitch.For the uninitiated, Twitch, is a video platform mostly devoted to gaming. When you sign up, you are asked to pick out some favourite video games and that choice shapes the channels and streams that are recommended to you. It’s an inherently interactive space: gamers are able to stream themselves playing to potentially huge worldwide audiences, with comments running in real time alongside their videos. And it is an intriguing place to suddenly start broadcasting black-and-white 1960s TV.Twitch is devoting seven weeks to showing Doctor Who stories from the original 1963-1989 run of the show on its Twitch Presents channel. So far, the stream has had more than 60m views, with thousands of people watching simultaneously. Kezia Newson, who writes about the show as one of the contributors to The Time Ladies blog, has likened it to enjoying Doctor Who in “a gloriously large living-room party”.The comments sidebar moves extremely fast, but still allows for communal jokes to emerge and develop. For example, every time Ian Chesterton (played by William Russell) and Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) have been on screen together, unaccompanied, a joyous chorus of “KISS! KISS! KISS!” rises up, referring to the are theyaren’t they ambiguity of their relationship in those 1960s scripts.Twitch has also added whole new catchphrases to Doctor Who fandom. In between each Hartnell episode a short trailer of clips from his era is repeated, to the point where key phrases from it, such as Ian exclaiming “London, 1965!”, have become social media shorthand for the whole marathon.Where is the money in this? Presumably, the BBC hopes that the stream will spur DVD sales and interest in the show worldwide. While Twitch is using it to drive subscriptions at $4.99 a month, for which you get 18 exclusive Doctor Who-themed emotes to add to your comments.Broadcasters with significant TV archives of cult material will be looking on with interest. Although there are a few new chatshow segments, featuring an array of Doctor Who writers and actors including author Paul Cornell and Katy Manning (who played Third Doctor companion Jo Grant), the main attraction is essentially old television being turned into appointment-to-view events.You can easily imagine shows with extensive back catalogues and big fanbases such as Coronation Street, EastEnders, Top of the Pops or The Simpsons exploring the approach. Twitch has previously tended to stream anime rather than ancient TV, a format much more closely aligned to its usual gamer demographic.The event has seen the hashtag #DoctorWhoOnTwitch break out of the realms of the gaming video service and on to other social media platforms. Series two’s oddball story The Web Planet trended on Twitter when it was streamed. Not bad for a piece of archive TV featuring a war between giant fibreglass ants that bump into the camera and bee-like moths that fly like pantomime Peter Pans.However, watching episodes back-to-back that were originally designed to be watched a week apart in an era when there was no home recording does highlight some of the limitations of the Who format. The propensity of the Doctor’s female companions to unfortunately trip and damage their ankles just as the Tardis needs to make a quick getaway has not gone unnoticed by the contemporary audience that’s now binge-watching the show.The marathon comes at a sensitive time for Doctor Who fandom, as the first series with a woman in the lead role approaches. Some fans have said they will refuse to watch the show with Jodie Whittaker as the Doctor, and there has also been consternation at the BBC unifying all merchandise under the new logo introduced for Whittaker’s tenure, abandoning the old series’ more more retro look. Not everyone is thrilled by the addition of the Twitch comment stream, either, with suggestions that it whizzes by too fast to engage with, and detracts from the experience of watching the show. Newson disagrees, saying: “The live reactions have added a new charm to stories. Watching it via Twitch has brought hilarity, friendship and brought the fandom together closer than it was before. The show is what binds us together, and we’re all sharing in its joy, everywhere at the same time.”For Doctor Who fans, the adventure on Twitch is only just beginning. Multiple stories will be streamed every week night until 23 July. Indeed, there is a bumper supply of Doctor Who online at the moment: the BBC is also making every episode of the show made since its 2005 reboot available on iPlayer in the runup to the new series."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f23ff34d3d8cee34a53bbbe8cec0a04abe95d7e8/0_158_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17db40af0d61eb4674b01197f524fa43","title":"everyday racism in america how to fix it","story":"To root out racism, academics and activists say, talk of healing is not enough: the bias at the heart of American politics, policing and society must be addressedIt seems as though every single day, the list grows.Waiting in a coffee shop while black. Selling real estate while black. Moving in while black. Napping while black. Working out while black.Ever since a Starbucks in the Philadelphia area came under national scrutiny for calling the police on two black men waiting for a business associate in one of the company’s coffee shops, new attention has been focused on the long list of mundane activities that black Americans can’t confidently engage in without being treated as suspicious or having the police called.“It’s just part of daily living. It’s what you expect as a person of color when you head out the door in the morning,” said Jeff Chang, the author of Who We Be: A Cultural History of Race in Post-Civil Rights America. “A moment like this just sort of galvanized folks to be able to express all the different ways in which they’ve been impacted by daily racism.”In many ways the newly energized conversation parallels how Black Lives Matter emerged as an ideological clearinghouse for the problem of racialized police violence several years ago. Neither phenomenon was new, but in both cases a stream of high profile incidents managed to snowball into its own trope, in part thanks to social media and smartphone videos. In this case that’s the trope of “everyday racism”. For experts, the genesis is clear. While the US has ended the formal, legal codes of enslavement and segregation that stood for most of the nation’s history, little has been done to change the minds of too many about the racist ideas that those structures rested on. “There has not been a society-wide and intensive challenge to racist ideas in the US,” said Ibram Kendi, the director of the Antiracist Research \u0026amp Policy Center at American University. “You’ve had people saying we need to have ‘national conversations’, You’ve have people calling for ‘healing’, because in their minds it’s just that people are hateful and they need to start loving ... But in terms of a national, widespread effort to reorient Americans’ racist ideas – that has never happened before.”And those ideas run deep, said Jamilah Lemieux, a cultural critic and writer. “Non-black people in this country have been fed a steady diet of propaganda from their parents, their schools, their churches, and from the media that tells them that people of color, and particularly black folks and Latinx people are not to be trusted.“They’ve been taught that we are criminals, that we are violent that we are predators and think we need to be monitored.” Barack Obama’s 2008 election was seen by much of white America as the dawning of a new, post-racial age. The logic held that, if a black man could attain the highest office in the land, then no goal could be considered out of reach for an inidual black person in modern America. This post-racial framing, of course, belies not just the inherited and institutional disadvantages black Americans face in housing, education, wealth, and other socioeconomic concerns, but also the emergence of what some have described as a “newer, slicker” form of racism. After the 2008 election, the anti-racist activist and writer Tim Wise described it as one where whites “hold the larger black community in low regard” but “carve out acceptable space for iniduals like Obama who strike them as different”.And insofar as Obama’s eight years in power fueled a renewed sense of purpose and organization among white nationalists, and triggered what the CNN pundit Van Jones famously described as a “whitelash”, some, including Obama himself, have wondered if his presidency actually set the project of racial equality back – at least temporarily. “Maybe we pushed too far,” Obama worried aloud to an aide shortly after the election, according to a forthcoming book. “Maybe people just want to fall back into their tribe.”That racial tribalism is part of what propelled Trump’s victory, despite the fact that he would go on to repeatedly describe himself as the “least racist person”. Trump’s popularity with unabashed white supremacists stems from things like his frequent ill-informed tweets and comments about inner city violence, and his reported use of the the phrase “shithole counties” in speaking about immigrants from black and brown nations.After the Starbucks incident, numerous other examples quickly emerged via news reports and social media. In New Jersey, two black men had police called on them by staff at a gym after being falsely accused of working out without proper memberships. Police in California swarmed three black women leaving an Airbnb when a neighbor concluded they were in the midst of a robbery. A woman in Oakland called the police on black residents for barbecuing in a park, and, at Yale University, a white woman called police on a black fellow student for falling asleep in a dorm common area.The presence of police is not the defining factor for everyday racism, or what some call “microaggressions”, but it is one of the harshest escalations. For Phillip Atiba Goff, a leading researcher on racial bias in policing and the president of the Center for Policing Equity, part of this has to do with the fact that black people and white people often share space in places like a university campus or a rapidly gentrifying city such as Oakland, California, but don’t always share bonds. “When you have people living close to each other who are not in community with each other, that breeds fear,” Goff said.He worries about what it means that in cases where officers functionally become “deputized as a kind of personal racism valet” – armed respondents to unfounded suspicions by white Americans. But from the perspective of law enforcement it’s a hard circle to square.“You can’t very well instruct your 911 operators to be like ‘yeah Mrs Smith, I know you said there were gangbangers but we know you’re probably just racist,” Goff said. Police have to respond, and are trained to treat every scenario as though it could become dangerous. “So they’re going to show up, and they’re generally going to be aggressive,” Goff added. “And by the time they figure out that you are not the issue, your dignity has been so assaulted that it really is difficult to have a pleasant conversation. For the cops and for the resident.”Thus, more than anything, what needs to be challenged to make real progress on everyday racism is racial bias, whether conscious or unconscious. “The only way we actually win, is to change the social norms,” Goff said.And for Kendi, like many race scholars, an important part of that is paying closer attention to social, economic and political policies that have a biased impact, rather than case by case negative exchanges iniduals have with one another. “Policies are the cradle of the racist ideas circulating in people’s minds that are leading to those interpersonal situations that are negatively affecting people,” Kendi said.“If people are really serious about being able to live freely and black in the United States, then the way really to do that is to be a part of the movement against racist policies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09812bcacb6cb5c0502a6cea36a40b99cace44f5/0_169_4200_2521/master/4200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53481d7d953817363830406c0e81532c","title":"all eyes on canada as first g7 nation prepares to make marijuana legal","story":"From crime to health to business, Canada’s decision to legalize marijuana is a grand progressive experiment that promises to answer a host of questionsWhen Canopy Growth opened its first cannabis factory in an old chocolate plant near Ottawa four years ago, it did so predicting a bright future. Canada had already legalized medical marijuana, and Canopy predicted full legalization for recreational use to be next.What the company hadn’t predicted, however, was the sudden flood of foreign visitors. Politicians and police authorities from Jamaica, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Greece and Australia have all come knocking, as well as doctors from New Zealand, Brazil and Chile, along with groups of corporate investors and bankers – so many that Canopy now sometimes splits up the groups according to their birthdays.“We knew we’d have to give a lot of tours, so we just cut a window into the wall,” said the company spokesman, Jordan Sinclair. “We put windows in all of the doors.” Canada will be thrust even more directly under the international microscope on Thursday, when a vote in the Senate is expected to ratify Bill C-45, effectively making Canada the first G20 nation to legalize recreational marijuana.“It’s going to be a bit of a science fiction experience for a while,” said Benedikt Fischer, an expert on substance use at Toronto’s biggest psychiatric hospital. “It’s unique in the world, because it’s happening for the first time in a wealthy country. It’s not like in the US, where there are these state experiments. Most people kind of ignore Uruguay. And so the world is really looking at this.”Governments, researchers and business leaders around the world all have their own reasons for keeping tabs. Legalization could affect Canada’s crime patterns, health and countless other factors – but exactly how, no one yet knows. Each Canadian province plans to roll out its newly legalized market in a slightly different way, creating about a dozen mini-laboratories within one massive test case.Even places that have already taken the legalization plunge are hoping Canada will solve some mysteries. After Colorado legalized marijuana five years ago, for example, organized crime reacted by ramping up supplies of “black tar heroin, opiates and harder drugs”, said Dr Larry Wolk, the state’s top public health official.But Wolk says he is interested to watch that process unfold on a bigger scale in Canada, where the new law is expected to deal a much more significant blow to the black market. Any new mix of illicit drugs in the country could have new effects on public health.One delicate balance for Canadian authorities has been guessing at what kind of pricing will be low enough to eradicate illicit sales – yet not so low as to entice new users. Canada’s finance minister, Bill Morneau, recently said the goal is “keeping cannabis out of the hands of kids and out of the black market. That means keeping the taxes low so we can actually get rid of the criminals in the system”.One sign of success will be if Canada not only discourages underground sales, but converts illicit sellers to the new system, said Tim Boekhout van Solinge, a Dutch criminologist.“What I am mainly following … is who will be the new legal growers, and whether authorities manage to get some of the illegal growers to become legal growers,” he said.Each country around the world that has debated whether to relax cannabis laws has had its own priority in mind: from generating revenue to discouraging drug cartels. In Canada, the emphasis has been largely on public health. Cannabis will be sold in fairly plain packaging, and usually through government-run boards that already control liquor sales.“It won’t be like buying Budweiser or branded alcoholic products,” said Steve Rolles of Transform, a UK drug policy thinktank. “It’s going to be more like buying pharmaceuticals from a chemist.”Still, it’s hard to know whether Canada, or any similar western country, will be able to stick to that public-health focus, he said.“We have concerns … that the lessons from alcohol and tobacco wouldn’t be learned, and we might see overcommercialized markets in which profit-making entities would seek to encourage more use and could encourage risky consumption behaviours,” he said.So far, Canada has allowed a few major players to dominate the industry, and their influence remains to be seen, said US marijuana industry expert Mark Kleiman.“You don’t want to build up big vested interests that then resist any change,” he said. “If you have commercial industry in cannabis, they’re going to end up writing the laws.”For epidemiologists, Canada will provide the best-ever data sets on cannabis use.Colorado’s health results have been encouraging, said Wolk. But overall, researchers lack solid data about cannabis use. Some key questions include addiction levels, how cannabis affects mental health, and effects on young people, said Israeli scientist Raphael Mechoulam, often called the “grandfather” of cannabis research.Another current Canadian health debate is how many people will be light, casual cannabis users, and how many will be heavy users.The government still must decide how to approach products that are “very potent” in THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis, said Mark Ware, a drug researcher and pain specialist who helped lead Canada’s federal taskforce advising the new legislation. Black-market sellers have produced increasingly strong concentrates, he said.“Those have not been the subject of studies up until recently, so the question of whether to regulate those, allow them in whatever context, and then be able to study their impacts on health, that would be very important,” he said. But “once they’re out there, it’s very hard to put them back in the box again”.Canadian police, meanwhile, will grapple with how to crack down on cannabis-impaired driving. That’s already a struggle around the world, regardless of marijuana’s legality, said Rolles. But it’s much more difficult to measure impairment from cannabis than from alcohol, and enforcing a legal limit will prove tricky.Meanwhile, many investors have already made huge profits from cannabis stocks, and a big question for them is whether the bubble bursts – or the value keeps rising.“They’re waiting to see if the sky’s going to fall,” said Sinclair of Canopy. One of about 100 Canadian legal producers of medical cannabis, the company owns a third of the medical market, began trading on the Toronto stock exchange in 2016 and last month became the only cannabis producer on the New York stock exchange."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/febe99d44574a88adfe6d7f4b44c8455dfdc426c/0_106_5248_3149/master/5248.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=634c46d8d25a511a486f669e765bbbc3","title":"new spanish pm appoints astronaut pedro duque science minister","story":"Pedro Sánchez appoints Pedro Duque, though most cabinet roles have gone to womenSpain’s new prime minister has appointed an astronaut as his science minister in a cabinet dominated by women.Pedro Sánchez announced on Wednesday that Pedro Duque, a 55-year-old veteran of two space missions, would serve as minister for science, innovation and universities in his new administration.Duque, who left Earth in 1998 and again in 2003, responded to his appointment on Twitter, saying he wished his mother was still alive to see it.

Damian Le Bas turns the key again. And again. After the eighth attempt, the engine rattles into life. “Thank fuck,” he exhales.Le Bas, 33, a writer and film-maker, is unusually relieved because the van has been his companion for thousands of miles while exploring Britain’s “stopping places” – the sites where Travellers traditionally pulled over – and the journey has become the subject of his first book. But his relief may also be partly because the Transit is one emblem of modern male Traveller identity, and he is alive to accusations that he is somehow not a real Gypsy. It has been suggested that Le Bas, who went to boarding school and Oxford University, is merely a hipster with a van.“A publisher asked: ‘Aren’t you just some really middle-class guy who happens to have a Traveller background?” says Le Bas. “He was implying that because I’m educated, I’m inauthentic. That is not a fantastic thing to say – that you can be educated out of your ethnicity. You can’t be educated out of being a Jamaican.”Le Bas is wearily familiar with the casual racism towards the ethnic minority of Gypsies and Travellers. As the former editor of the Travellers’ Times, he devoted himself to defending the different Roma communities, particularly after news stories about Gypsy criminality or disputes when Travellers settled in villages. He found this “exhausting and demoralising”, and wanted to explore both his own roots and the history of Gypsies in Britain, so his road trip began.Life on the road was a novel experience for Le Bas because, like many contemporary Travellers, he grew up “settled”, just outside Hove. “It was a typical Travellers’ yard in that there was an antagonistic relationship with the local authority. They had distributed flyers prior to my family moving up there saying: ‘Stop the Gypsies moving in.’” Le Bas spent his early childhood in houses, mobile homes and caravans (“trailers”) with his extended family, including his mother and father, who were both artists, and his nan – great-grandmother Julie Jones, who is 91. We meet at her house in Worthing, and she listens with interest as we talk in her front room.When Le Bas was 11, he won a life-changing scholarship to Christ’s Hospital, a boarding school in West Sussex. “My grandfather was very against the idea of me going to this weird school where who knew what I’d be exposed to. When I was homesick, my dad just wanted to pull me out. My mum stuck to her guns. It was very hard and upsetting for her but she thought if I went to a local school I might end up in trouble.” What did his nan think? “I cried when he went but it was a good thing,” says Jones. Was his family worried Le Bas would abandon Gypsy traditions? “No,” she says. “I thought of him being safe there and doing good for himself.”Le Bas didn’t feel safe enough at boarding school to reveal his background to any pupils except for two of his closest friends. “And also I wasn’t sure what it was. A lot of my family are true Romany Gypsies but I didn’t know where I fitted in to all that. I felt like I belonged to something but Travellers aren’t always so sure.” Although Le Bas speaks Romany, there were non-Gypsy relatives on both sides of his family tree. “A lot of Travellers draw a hard line between Gypsies and gorjies, non-Travellers, and I’ve got both in me.”Le Bas went on to Oxford, where he studied Hebrew and Greek as part of his theology degree. How many Gypsy students did he know? “I’ve never met another Traveller who has been to Oxbridge,” he says. Even though Le Bas was an exception at university, he grew more confident about his identity and challenged his peers’ racism. His education made him an exception among Travellers, too: he didn’t marry until he was 26 (his wife is the actor Candis Nergaard), unlike his mum who was married at 19, and he acquired an unplaceable accent, not at all plummy but with a Kentish inflection that sounds older than his years.It would be easy for The Stopping Places to be an angry rant, but Le Bas consciously “killed my old journalistic self” and tried to “eschew romanticism and angry activism” to write an elegiac contemporary travelogue. The book is also distinctive for being arguably the first literary exploration of Anglo-Romany culture by a Traveller. Serious studies of Gypsy culture are mostly the preserve of non-Gypsy academics (with a couple of exceptions in the United States). “It has been a monopoly of non-Gypsies for ever, to be honest,” says Le Bas. The book was also a more personal challenge: “I wanted to test the idea of being ‘a lesser son of greater sires’, a phrase from Tolkien,” he says. “It’s not easy growing up with stories of Nan’s father, who could weave a basket from reeds that could hold water. And master horses and heal people with herbalism. That’s how skilled he was. What can I do? I spent my childhood playing a Game Boy and riding a BMX.”But Le Bas soon becomes more comfortable in his own skin, and on the road. It changes his perception of time, he’s more aware of nature (“I’m not saying I’m some kind of horse whisperer but I’d be a little bit more attuned to what animals were doing”) and realises the starkness of the distinction between summer and winter. “Summer is really nice and winter is really horrible,” he says. Mud besmirches his van’s tiny, neat living space. “You’re hemmed in by rain for days. And if you’ve got washing to dry, it’s hard. Don’t ask me – Nan lived it.”During his travels, he developed a conviction that we should recognise a Romany geography. One stopping place, Messenger’s Meadow, had a sign instructing people not to disturb the soil because of Roman remains. “If there are Roman remains in the soil and we shouldn’t disturb them, we might want to think about the Gypsy remains at old stopping places. Roadside burials used to be common when people couldn’t afford a formal internment.” Not only are historic stopping places unheralded, but they are often barred by bollards or bunds of earth to stop their use today. Le Bas only knows one common in southern England on to which Gypsies can still freely drive. Nearly a decade ago, there were a series of conflicts when Travellers bought land and “settled” in rural villages. “People always point out: ‘They are Travellers, they should travel,’” he says. “It’s not the travel that’s the problem, it’s the stopping.”Is intolerance towards Travellers growing? “It has been pretty bad in the past,” he says. “At the minute, they are not hanging Gypsies for being Gypsies in England.” Le Bas writes about the case of Francis Buckley, a 16-year-old Gypsy boy from Islington who was arrested, tried and hanged, bizarrely, for impersonating a Gypsy – “counterfeiting himself to be an Egyptian”. Romany people, Le Bas argues, are “permanently trapped” in “the pincer of demonisation and romanticisation”. He dates the rise of anti-Gypsy prejudice to the birth of the nation state. “The nomad presented a problem to the nation state in terms of collecting taxes, because they had no fixed address. But there is also fear of a group that is perceived to be clannish and apart in some way. Many of these prejudices are very similar to antisemitic prejudices, and they are not really about nomadism. They are about a group that exists simultaneously within and outside European society. You can’t disregard pure racism as being a factor.”Now the internet amplifies hate, says Le Bas, and the mainstream media doesn’t help. At the Travellers’ Times he tackled the fallout from the Channel 4 series, My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding. “It did an awful lot of damage, not just to Travellers, but to people who made the programme and the people who consumed it.” He’s still enraged by its “colonial tone” and the myths it propagated, such as that there is a tradition of “grabbing” young women. “That was some teenagers in a car park outside Staines bragging about their exploits and they inferred that this was a cultural practice with deep roots, which is absolute rubbish.”For all his determination to challenge prejudice, Le Bas does not seek to “represent” his people. “In so many ways I’m the least representative person you can think of,” he says. Besides, Travellers do not want to be represented. “There is no Board of British Romanies, nor is there likely to be. But I felt I had a responsibility as a thinking citizen as much as a Traveller to challenge this deeply unsatisfactory media narrative, which lacks nuance and colour. It’s just so boring and repetitive and unfair.” That narrative focuses on criminal or antisocial behaviour. “Journalists can’t report on an absence of criminality, on an absence of rubbish, because there’s nothing to report on, and so those who behave badly monopolise the coverage,” says Le Bas.In the future, Le Bas hopes he might articulate his culture through fiction but he also wants to defend the Romany language, which still has no official recognition in British law. “I worry that kids aren’t learning the language to the same level,” he says. “A view of the world can live within a language and be lost with it.”And what does Nan think? “It’s good,” says Jones. “I tell him, if he wants to do it, get on with it. You can’t live your life for other people. You’ve got to do what you want to do, what you think is right.”Le Bas smiles. “You see, Nan just sums it up better.”The Stopping Places by Damian Le Bas is published on 7 June by Chatto \u0026amp Windus, priced £14.99.

The 13th annual Pfizer Health Index charts the health perceptions and behaviours of Irish adults and this year points to substantial differences between how the various age groups view their own health.The survey ided adults into three distinct categories – those aged 20 to 39, 40 to 60 and 61 and older - and asked a range of health-related questions such as what illnesses concerned them most, what steps they felt they could take for the benefit of their future health, and what significant “life milestones” have had the most impact on how they approach their health.It found illness concerns vary substantially with adults in the youngest group most likely to worry about mental health, diabetes and obesity. Heart disease, cholesterol and arthritis are of greater concern among those aged 40 to 60 while respondents aged over 61 told researchers they were most concerned about cancer and Alzheimer’s.The survey found the youngest group was more focused on appearance with diet and exercise ranking as their top health priorities. In middle age, reducing consumption of alcohol becomes the main priority while disease prevention ranks as number one among those aged 61 and over.More exercise and a better diet were widely recognised as being the key steps to take for better health in later life, with younger adults also identifying that mental health as being important to future good health.If they could go back to an earlier point in their life 56 per cent of those polled said they would exercise more and 53 per cent claimed they would have a better diet if given the chance to live their lives all over again. Being calmer, not smoking and going to the dentist more also featured prominently as things people would modify if given the chance. “Starting to feel old” was the most transformative life experience that affects how people of all ages approach their health with 37 per cent of those polled agreeing with this statement. Men were more likely to describe feeling old as having the most profound impact on how they view their future health while the arrival of a child has more of an impact on women. Most people surveyed said their happiest period was when they were young and single although a majority of those over 60 said being “married with children” was their happiest time.All told, 69 per cent of those surveyed rated their health as 7 out of 10 or higher although only 6 per cent gave themselves a perfect 10. People continue to believe the health should remain the Government’s top priority with 62 per cent of those polled expressing the view that it was of paramount importance, a long way ahead of education (12 per cent) and job creation (11 per cent). Finance is now listed as the issue which most people are prioritising with 32 per cent giving it the highest ranking up from 16 per cent last year. In the past, family and personal health were the top concerns listed.Prof Charles Normand, Professor of Health Policy and Management in Trinity College, Dublin, said starting to feel old was “certainly a life experience the vast majority of us can expect to go through, and we need to start looking after our health now to ensure we remain healthy in older age for as long as possible.”He described as “encouraging” the finding that the 60 plus cohort “are cognisant of maintaining their health” and said “we need to look after this age group in our health service and ensure younger generations are as educated about the importance of health maintenance as possible.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3521252.1528294006!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leaving cert english out with the old in with the younger","story":"Students from Sandford Park School in Ranelagh, Dublin react to English paper one in this year\u0027s Leaving Cert.

However, she said, asking them to evaluate a film adaptation of a text and compare it with a written version, as well as assessing the advantages and disadvantages of each of these formats within a 30-40 minute timeframe, was intimidating.Studyclix.ie teacher Lorraine Tuffy, who works at Jesus \u0026amp Mary Secondary School in Sligo, said the paper required students to draw from their engagement with studied texts, which was normally reserved for paper two.“The composition options were broad and varied. Question seven, encouraging students to consider the weight of words, is a particularly relevant task. Essay questions were, for the most part, engaging, with student asked to reflect on the value of personal space and quietness in the modern world, leaders and leadership, and language as a weapon.”She said overall students were happy with the paper.Just over 40,000 students sat this year’s higher level paper, while 13,810 took the ordinary level paper.Kate Barry, ASTI subject representative and a teacher at Loreto Fermoy, said there were no major surprises on the ordinary level paper, with a good range of topics and nothing too difficult.“There was a nice question on the impact of technology and another asking them to write about what they achieved in life so far, and what they hope to achieve, and it could not have been more inviting.”However, she said that a question asking candidates to write a diary entry where they represented their school ignored the reality that not all Leaving Cert students were in school and that some of them were in further education or could even be sitting the exam in prison.

Examination centres have also been established in 13 prisons and other places of detention to facilitate prisoners sitting exams.

The non-curricular languages include Polish, modern Greek, Danish and, for the first time, Maltese.Oral tests in Leaving Certificate language subjects were conducted in the two week period between Monday 9th and Friday 20th April, along with the practical tests in Leaving and Junior Certificate Music and Junior Certificate Home Economics.The examinations run until Wednesday 20th June for Junior CertificateCycle subjects and Friday 22nd June for Leaving Certificate subjects. Yesterday, Minister for Education and Skills Richard Bruton sent his best wishes to students, who, he said, “should be very proud” after putting in “a huge effort to get to this point”. Mr Bruton pointed out that there are multiple pathways now in place for students to realise their ambitions.“As well as higher and further education courses, we now have a very broad range of apprenticeship and traineeship programmes available, in very exciting new areas, such as ICT and financial services, as well as the traditional craft courses. “These are very attractive options that lead to very rewarding careers, when considering your next steps,” he said. Mr Bruton also paid tribute to teachers, principals and parents for supporting their students prepare for these exams. We are very fortunate in Ireland to have such a dedicated and committed teaching profession. “Teachers and school leaders have a transformative impact on a child’s life and make an invaluable contribution to our society. Thank you for your efforts again this year and the best of luck again, to all students sitting the state exams,” he said.The examinations run until Wednesday 20th June for Junior CertificateCycle subjects and Friday 22nd June for Leaving Certificate subjects. The written examinations in the Leaving Certificate Applied programme finish on Thursday 14th June. Clive Byrne, director of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, pointed out the importance of rest.“The Leaving Cert is an immensely stressful time. While you should be working hard, you shouldn’t be pushing yourself to the edge of a nervous breakdown. You need to be calm and collected on the day. “You won’t be productive if you study for twelve hours straight, locked away like a monk in a cell. Take regular breaks and reward your work by doing something that you enjoy. Listen to music, go for a walk, and talk to your friends and family.” he said.ASTI president Ger Curtin urged students to keep things in perspective over the coming weeks: “While some level of anxiety is completely normal, it’s really important that you keep things in perspective. Exams are just one small aspect of life. They are not everything. It is much more important to focus on how you are, rather than how you are performing, over the coming weeks. Eat well, get plenty of rest, take exercise, build in relaxation time, organise yourself so that you have everything you need each day and so that you are not rushing to get to an exam in time,” he said.The 2018 Leaving Cert results will be available on Wednesday 15th August while results of the Junior CertificateCycle will be available in mid-September."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Former Anglo chief executive seldom reacted during evidenceMost damaging fallout of sit-it-out strategy was five months in maximum-security jailPaul Bradley and his sons Jason, Dean and Ryan on trial for murder of Neil Reilly in DublinJudge Karen O\u0026rsquoConnor agreed to remand Drumm on bail until June 20th for sentencingJohn Early dies after swimming near Terryglass a man in his 40s dies near PortumnaThomas Fox (31) and siblings Regina (41) and Jonathan Keogh (32) on trial over 2016 killing\u0026lsquoBobby offended no one\u0026rsquo says life-long friend after Bray shootingAction by landlord opposing \u0026euro910 award to tenant would cost thousands in legal fees, judge saysEach member of EuroMillions syndicate to collect \u0026euro543,000Three men and one woman, all aged in their 20s, were arrested at a house in Carlow townExam fortnight starts with English paper as Junior Cycle and Leaving Cert exams get under wayFew customers actually use salad cream on salads, research findsPeople over 60 believe their time married with young children as the best stage of their life\u0026lsquoNo more overly expensive calls and SMS\u0026rsquo - calls to be capped at 19 cents a minuteGovernment sources insist such actions were expected and will not \u0026lsquoderail\u0026rsquo plans\u0026lsquoYou don\u0026rsquot wake up and think you\u0026rsquore going to have a triple shooting here\u0026rsquoFather of Olympic champion Katie has been operating gym and fitness business"},{"url":null,"title":"magdalene woman we were slaves to the nuns and the church but no more","story":"  June 5, 2018First time for many to speak freely to other women incarcerated in the laundries   June 5, 2018When I first met her she doubted justice would ever come her way-not from the Good Shepherd Sisters and not from the Irish State   June 5, 2018President apologises at \u0026Aacuteras reception to women who worked in laundries   June 5, 2018Banquet held in Dublin\u0026rsquos Mansion House for some 230 people incarcerated in laundries "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3519938.1528180184!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brussels talks mark beginning of crucial fortnight on brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has been increasing pressure on London to propose more concrete solutions in time for the summit. Photograph: EPABALAZS MOHAIToday begins a critical fortnight in the Brexit negotiations, with Irish officials expecting to receive long-awaited British proposals on the Border in the coming days. Talks are scheduled between the British and EU sides every day this week.The Government wants to see significant progress at the technical talks this week in an effort to break the stalemate between the EU and UK over the future of the Border, and high-ranking sources confirmed that they expected to see proposals from the British this week.Dublin is pressing the British to provide more detailed alternative solutions and proposals on a legally-operable text on the default “backstop” option that would effectively keep Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market and customs union should no other plan be agreed to maintain an invisible border. The timetable for the EU-UK talks in Brussels lists a session on Wednesday on Ireland and Northern Ireland. Sources in Brussels say that it is expected to be a short meeting, dealing with a number of technical issues, although if the UK brings new proposals they will be discussed.Three more days of talks follow this week on the draft Withdrawal Agreement. The Government has cast the coming two weeks as crucial in the negotiations if a solution to the Border issue is to be approved by EU leaders at a European Council summit at the end of this month.The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has been increasing pressure on London to propose more concrete solutions in time for the summit. Tánaiste Simon Coveney, the Government’s lead Brexit negotiator, has warned of a difficult summer of negotiations if no progress is made by this summit, pushing negotiations to the October deadline set to allow the UK and EU parliaments time to approve any final withdrawal deal by the UK’s departure next March. “Our position remains that significantly more progress is needed ahead of the June European Council, ” said a spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs.“Michel Barnier has made this very clear, including during his recent visit to Ireland and Northern Ireland. At this stage in the process the UK must engage in a more detailed way on the draft text of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, including the backstop.”Concerns about the lack of progress in negotiations were voiced by Germany’s top Brexit diplomat Peter Ptassek, who played down expectations about agreement being reached by the council on June 28th-29th. Irish officials viewed Mr Ptassek’s remarks as another attempt to increase the pressure on the British to propose solutions in what is viewed as a make-or-break fortnight to prepare for the June summit as UK media reports suggest the British is preparing “Doomsday” contingency plans for no deal. An influential London think tank has said in a new report that British prime minister Theresa May should propose her own version of the backstop for the Border before the summit.“The UK has made it clear that the EU version of the backstop is unacceptable.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

He said crocodiles which attacked people effectively learnt how to target “large prey items”.The dog got right up close to the crocodile\u0027s head, Mr Britton told ABC News.Mr Britton said the incident was a reminder to people to stay away from crocodile habitats, particularly if small dogs were present.Please review our commenting policyFire in central London: Almost 100 firefighters sent to tackle blaze at Mandarin Oriental hotelHundreds going blind each year amid NHS delays, research shows Channel 5 revived TV keep-fit with a live yoga class – so I tried it at homeF-35: the fighter jet of the futurePMQs analysis: Theresa May fails to fend off difficult questions from CorbynBritish woman dubbed \u0026#39the Portofino pirate\u0026#39 after trying to steal a yacht from Italian Riviera - and nearly getting away with itBilderberg group: The secret meeting of minds with Osborne, Rudd and Kissinger on this year\u0026#39s guest listComment: It was a terrible error of judgment for Justin Welby to publicly embrace EU utopianismFashion designer Kate Spade found dead at 55 in suspected suicideWidow, 100, who moved to Britain from Poland after Second World War dies after breaking neck in muggingLove Island 2018: A beginner\u0026#39s guide to the new series and contestantsOver-the-limit British Airways pilot arrested in cockpit after panicked cabin crew called 999, court hearsGrenfell Tower Inquiry: occupant of flat where fire started demands exoneration from \u0026#39racist assumptions\u0026#39Comment: Africa must not wait for advances in malaria innovation – we must pioneer themRobert Peston takes on Newsnight as ITV show moves to Wednesday nightsMystery illness kills eight in UgandaMichael McIntyre robbed by moped muggers on school run with childrenSentosa island in Singapore chosen for Donald Trump summit with Kim Jong-unBritain, France and Germany tells US to spare European companies from sanctions on IranThe holiday resort with a dark past that will host historic Trump-Kim summitWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 6 june 2018","story":"Kilauea Volcano eruptions, preparations for the launch of the Soyuz MS-09 spacecraft and D-Day Veterans in Normandy are some of Wednesday\u0027s pictures of the dayFire in central London: Almost 100 firefighters sent to tackle blaze in KnightsbridgeHundreds going blind each year amid NHS delays, research shows Channel 5 revived TV keep-fit with a live yoga class – so I tried it at homeF-35: the fighter jet of the futurePMQs analysis: Theresa May fails to fend off difficult questions from CorbynBritish woman dubbed \u0026#39the Portofino pirate\u0026#39 after trying to steal a yacht from Italian Riviera - and nearly getting away with itBilderberg group: The secret meeting of minds with Osborne, Rudd and Kissinger on this year\u0026#39s guest listComment: It was a terrible error of judgment for Justin Welby to publicly embrace EU utopianismFashion designer Kate Spade found dead at 55 in suspected suicideWidow, 100, who moved to Britain from Poland after Second World War dies after breaking neck in muggingCrocodile eats beloved terrier that spent a decade taunting it Love Island 2018: A beginner\u0026#39s guide to the new series and contestantsOver-the-limit British Airways pilot arrested in cockpit after panicked cabin crew called 999, court hearsGrenfell Tower Inquiry: occupant of flat where fire started demands exoneration from \u0026#39racist assumptions\u0026#39Comment: Africa must not wait for advances in malaria innovation – we must pioneer themRobert Peston takes on Newsnight as ITV show moves to Wednesday nightsMystery illness kills eight in UgandaMichael McIntyre robbed by moped muggers on school run with childrenSentosa island in Singapore chosen for Donald Trump summit with Kim Jong-unBritain, France and Germany tells US to spare European companies from sanctions on IranWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"see eerie devastation left guatemalas fuego volcano","story":"Drone footage captures the devastation left by Guatemala\u0027s Fuego volcano.

Log inIn a notice this week the European Commission has advised continental European businesses to think twice before using parts and components made in Britain.It’s reported that European firms\u0026nbspmight need to look elsewhere for parts if they wish to continue benefiting from EU free trade agreements with other countries such as South Korea and Mexico.But why is the Commission issuing this advice? How serious are the economic implications for UK companies? And is there any way around it?It’s a direct consequence of Brexit.Leaving the EU automatically means that the UK becomes a “third country” to the bloc.When the EU did some\u0026nbsp40\u0026nbspfree trade deals with the likes of South Korea, Mexico and South Africa the agreements stipulated that any produce or manufactured good which passed between them tariff-free had to have genuinely originated in the two signatory countries or blocs.This stipulation was necessary to prevent other countries essentially free-riding on the deal. For instance, a firm in a third country could export their goods to one of the two parties to the free trade agreement and then re-export\u0026nbspgoods to the other party without paying the applicable tariffs.To prevent this happening the two countries in the deal impose “rules of origin” checks on imports. For the UK, while it’s in the EU, this is not a problem. Any UK goods pass through fine. Also, any UK components in EU goods are not a problem at all.But with the UK out of the EU’s customs union the situation is potentially very different. Rules of origin specify that a certain proportion of a good has to have been made in the country or bloc to qualify.\u0026nbspThe proportion varies with the good in question, but\u0026nbspit’s often around 50 per cent. For cars the requirement is 60 per cent.If, after Brexit, an EU business has used components sourced in the UK, that could potentially push the proportion of the exported EU good under the threshold, meaning it would fail the rule of origin requirement and be forced to pay the standard tariff.This is why the Commission has issued its warning to EU firms to be wary about using UK manufactured goods if they don’t want to have a nasty surprise when they seek to export to third countries with which the EU has a trade deal.Potentially very serious because the UK is firmly embedded in pan-European corporate supply chains. The UK sends around 44 per cent of its exports to the EU. Among the biggest categories of goods exported are chemicals, pharmaceuticals, aerospace and vehicles.And research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found the share of the EU’s imports from the UK that were “intermediate” goods and services (i.e components) was 69 per cent in 2014, up from 61 per cent in 2000.Not all of those imports will be baked into products and re-exported from the EU, but a fair amount will.Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform think tank says that sectors which traditionally find rules of origin burdensome include textiles, food, machinery and vehicles.To give one high-profile example of a UK component of an EU export, the wings of the Airbus are currently manufactured in Broughton, North Wales. They are exported and the plane is assembled in Toulouse and then sold all around the world.The natural way to solve the rules of origin problem would seem to be for the UK to form a new customs union with the EU and to “grandfather”, or roll over, the EU’s existing free trade agreements so that they are applicable to the UK, as well as the EU, after Brexit.However, both are far more easily said than done. The UK Cabinet is split on what sort of long-term customs arrangement it wants to push for with the EU – and both schemes they are considering have already been rejected by the EU.There is also no guarantee the third countries will simply agree to roll over their trade agreements with the EU for the UK – some may wish to take the opportunity to re-open them.And even if they did grandfather their trade deals, as Peter Holmes and Michael Gasiorek of the UK Trade Policy Observatory have pointed out, when it comes to solving the rules of origin problem the UK would, for various technical reasons, often require not just the agreement of the third country but also the EU as well.Given all these hurdles, it would hardly be surprising if EU firms currently using UK components became nervous about these multiple deals not, ultimately, materialising.The two-year transition deal due to kick in in March 2019 should, in theory, delay the day of reckoning because it is assumed the EU will ask countries with which it has a free trade deal to treat the UK as if it is effectively still an EU member. But it cannot be taken for granted\u0026nbspthat those countries will agree to do this, adding another layer of uncertainty for Continental firms.“Faced with this uncertainty EU firms may well start to source inputs from elsewhere because they don’t want to risk not getting originating status,” says Dr Gasiorek.“This matters most where the tariffs that the EU would face on its exports are high. For some industries where supply contracts may have a long duration, I would expect this to already be an issue.”However, Alan Winters of Sussex University\u0026nbspthinks more firms will delay drastic decisions. “My sense is that there will be some re-sourcing…but a lot of these supply chain are pretty complicated and it’s quite expensive to do so, so they may wait and see,” he says.Mr Lowe points out that the incentive for the European Union side to solve the Brexit rules of origin problem might be blunted due to the fact that if EU companies do start sourcing more in the rest of the EU that’s a potential spur to growth and jobs within the bloc.Of course, the same post-Brexit rules of origin problems work in the other direction and British firms are likely to feel pressure to replace some EU-sourced components with UK-sourced ones.The Society of Motor Manufacturers, for instance, has pointed out that only around 40 per cent of the average UK-made car is currently local content, potentially complicating any future trade deals the post-Brexit UK might seek to strike.You can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?The Independent and its partners use cookies and similar technology to collect and analyse information about the users of this website.

Tidal turbines and wave energy converters will generate the electricity for the data centre, which is as powerful as several thousand high-end consumer PCs.“With our supportive policy environment, skilled supply chain, and our renewable energy resources and expertise, Scotland is the ideal place to invest in projects such as this, Scottish Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse said, according to a Microsoft blogpost.It helps to strengthen Scotland’s position as a champion of the new ideas and innovation that will shape the future.”If successful, more data centres will be placed in bodies of water near coastal cities in order to improve web access for people living close to the coast.“It is kind of a crazy experiment,” said Ben Cutler, who heads Project\u0026nbspNatick. He adds that future centres could be deployed in as little as 90 days.One of the biggest challenges for the engineers involved in Project Natick\u0026nbsphas been building a data centre that needs no maintenance while in operation, as if anything goes wrong it will need to be resurfaced in order to fix.The Orkney data centre will be monitored for the next 12 months to judge the future feasibility of the project.I’m proud that some of the first milestones achieved by Project Natick will occur in UK waters, Cindy Rose, chief executive of Microsoft UK, said in the blogpost.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

And so for that, I feel gratified. But honestly, last weekend was a very emotional one, and I cried many times, because just seeing him brings up a lot of bad feelings.She continued: He\u0027s raped many people that I love, so it\u0027s not really a happy occasion. I think maybe there will be some celebration when he gets convicted and goes to jail. That\u0027s when the process will be complete and we will see justice really being served. But until then, this is a great first step.Sorvino\u0026nbsprevealed that despite the public not knowing about her alleged encounter with Weinstein, she had been telling people in her life about it for years.The funny thing is: At the time it happened, I told everyone I knew, and a lot of people will tell you that, she explained. All these people wrote to me online: \u0027I remember you telling me that.\u0027 Quentin Tarantino corroborated that I had told him about it right away that September he said it in the New York Times article.Despite her discussing the alleged situation, she wasn\u0027t \u0026nbspencouraged to come forward about what had happened to her.\u0026nbspShe continued, No one said, \u0027Hey, this is sexual harassment. You should go to the authorities. You have a case. You should go to the police. Maybe it\u0027s assault.\u0027\u0026nbspInstead people were comforting her.I didn\u0027t really understand the law and I didn\u0027t think I was important enough to make a big deal over, so I just kind of tried to put it to the side, keep working and go on about my life, she admitted.\u0026nbspI think a lot of people felt that way.The 50-year-old actress said none of the alleged victims compared notes and that she only knew of one other person - who\u0026nbspshe later revealed as Sophie Dix - that had experienced the alleged abuse at the hands of Weinstein.She then stopped mid-sentence while talking to Guthrie and began tearing up when she saw Weinstein\u0027s alleged​ victims on a screen behind her.Guthrie later brought up Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson who last year claimed that Miramax made him blacklist Sorvino and other actresses including Ashley Judd.\u0026nbspWeinstein subsequently denied the blacklist accusations.\u0026nbspI didn\u0027t even know what I suspected,\u0026nbspshe said. I just knew that my career had kind of slumped. I thought, \u0027Well, maybe it\u0027s my fault. Maybe I\u0027ve had too many children. I\u0027ve been pregnant too many times.\u0027 You know, sometimes you have bad luck. I was like, \u0027OK, maybe it wasn\u0027t meant to be that my career was going to continue at the same level that it had been.\u0027But once Jackson tweeted that he was forced to blacklist her, she knew it was really this malevolent hand that changed the course of my life.Since his indictment, Weinstein has pled\u0026nbspnot guilty to charges of rape in the first and third degrees and of a criminal sexual act in the first degree.\u0026nbspIn the past, he has denied all claims of non-consensual sex.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

As Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, argues, Britain could have a second EU referendum before Christmas this year, giving time for a lengthy 12-week campaign starting next September.Nick Clegg puts a rather different argument. He says that Brexit should be put to a second referendum because people who voted Leave are dying off.\u0026nbspThe “high point” of support for Brexit had passed because “the oldest voters voted for Brexit in the largest numbers” while the young voted to remain in the EU.\u0026nbspMy case is that the first referendum said we should leave without specifying how. In a second referendum, the government would in effect say – here’s the deal we have negotiated... do you approve? What could be more logical? What could be more natural?\u0026nbspNothing except that Ms May has ruled out a second Brexit referendum. In February, in a typically muddled formulation, she told a conference:\u0026nbsp“We are leaving the EU and there is no question of a second referendum or going back and I think that’s important. People in the UK feel very strongly that if we take a decision, then governments should turn not round and say, no, you got that wrong.” But if anybody is going to say, “you got that wrong”, it wouldn’t be the government but rather the people saying to the prime minister that she got wrong the exit terms she negotiated.\u0026nbspThat is what Ms May doesn’t like about the notion of a second referendum.In fact, there is a strong case for holding a second referendum. Since 23 June 2016, the date of the first referendum, we have learnt quite a few things we didn’t know before. Business chiefs, for instance, are worried about the time-wasting bureaucracy of filling in customs declarations after Brexit takes place. That is what a hard border would mean.As to the Brexiteers’ notion that technology could be used to avoid this, Jon Thompson, chief executive of HM Revenue and\u0026nbspCustoms, delivered a stark verdict\u0026nbspwhen he appeared before the Treasury Committee.\u0026nbspThe cost to business of introducing a high-tech customs plan would be up to £20bn a year, he said. That is a frighteningly high price to pay.\u0026nbspWhen we cast our referendum vote, we also hadn’t thought about complex procedures such as car assembly. As a car chassis moves along the production line, components from all over Europe are put into their appointed places. If this is taking place in a British car plant, then many of the components will have come from the continent. If the plant is on the other side of the Channel, then many British-made parts will have had to have been shipped across. In fact, more than two-thirds of the UK’s exports to the EU take the form of intermediate inputs to the production of finished goods and services. Likewise, about 55 per cent of imports from the EU represent products to be incorporated in final production in the UK. If all this were to be subject to customs clearance, then the whole series of complex procedures would come to a halt.No wonder the prospect of Brexit is already having a negative effect on economic activity. As the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, an intergovernmental economic organisation, commented this week: “Economic growth is projected to remain modest at 1.4 per cent in 2018 and 1.3 per cent in 2019, owing to high uncertainties about the outcome of Brexit negotiations.”\u0026nbspThis is about half the rate of growth being experienced by the rest of Europe. Did we know that Brexit would condemn Britain to reduced economic activity?In short, we need a second referendum because we know much more about the disadvantages of leaving the European Union that we did when we were first asked. Moreover, in Ms May we have a prime minister who cannot make up her mind about anything. The Financial Times put this point strongly on 17 May: “It has been 693 days since Britain voted to leave the EU. In another 316, that decision is set to become reality. Yet the government of Theresa May has still not come to an agreement – either with itself or with Brussels – on what the new economic relationship with the continent should be. This was the most basic question raised by Brexit, and it should have been answered before Article 50 was triggered, setting in motion withdrawal.\u0026nbspFailure to do so is testament to political isions and weak leadership.”\u0026nbspSo we shall have to make up Ms\u0026nbspMay’s mind for her.So, in light of this muddle and confusion, what question would be put in a second referendum?\u0026nbspIn the 2016 referendum the question was\u0026nbspshould the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\u0026nbspIn effect, this formulation called for an answer from the gut. Like it or leave it? But in a second referendum, this luxury would not be available.\u0026nbspThere would have to be reference to the terms of disengagement covering such crucial questions as whether the UK would remain a member of some kind of customs union.\u0026nbspAs it is hard to get such detail into a simple question, I suggest the following:Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave on such terms as approved by parliament?\u0026nbspIn addition, a simple version of the terms approved by parliament could be sent to every voter and could be made available in voting stations.This would have the merit of emphasising that parliament is the supreme decision-making body in this country. However, as a Remainer, I must remember a key rule about asking questions – never ask one when you might not like the answer. How likely is it that the answer to a second referendum might differ from the first? Remember that voters are likely to be hostile to the holding of a second referendum. They may think – you have asked us once, we gave you an answer, don’t bother us again. With the result that the turnout for a second referendum would likely be low and thus unconvincing.However, Peter Kellner, the experienced political commentator and former president of YouGov, has just published a much more upbeat appraisal.\u0026nbspHe believes that below the surface, public opinion is stirring. In particular, one million Labour voters who backed Brexit two years ago are having second thoughts. His study of recent polling results convinces him that significant numbers of younger Leave voters, as well as those supporting Labour in last year’s election, no longer think Brexit is right for Britain. He also supports the Nick Clegg thesis and argues that the effects of demographic changes since the referendum are growing. “Bluntly,”\u0026nbspas he writes, “older, mainly Leave, voters are dying and younger, mainly Remain, voters are joining the electorate.”Mr Kellner bases his findings in the more than 23,000 voters that YouGov has questioned since the start of the year.\u0026nbspAnd his conclusion is that there is a real prospect that if the people were given the final say on Brexit, they would vote for the UK to stay in the European Union. So let’s have a second referendum.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

A car industry executive told the broadcaster said the change was a “catastrophe” for the car industry.“The hard Brexiteers have built a bomb under the UK automotive industry and the EU have lit it,” they said.It says UK supplies have already started losing orders for cars to export to countries like South Korea, Canada, and South Africa which have free trade agreements with the EU.Exit from the customs union and the subsequent changes to rules of origin are also likely to be disruptive for British businesses in other ways. UK exporters selling into the EU under any future free trade agreement would have to prove they originate from the UK, which can be a costly and bureaucratic procedure, reducing the competitiveness of British goods compared to EU ones. UK businesses that use components sourced from outside the EU may also not gain preferential access if they are found to be mostly worked on elsewhere.Under most rules of origin, a manufacturer needs to show that around 55 per cent of its value was created in the EU. The rules, which are a standard feature of all trade agreements across the world, are in place to stop countries re-exporting goods produced elsewhere on favourable terms.Staying in the EU customs union would remove all of these issues because the UK would continue to coordinate its trade policy with the EU.Commenting on the new warning, the EU’s deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand said: “Preferential rules of origin were the subject of my very first meeting on my very first day in the European Commission back in 1994. They have not become any simpler since.”A UK Government spokesperson said: This is simply dealing with what would happen in a \u0027no-deal\u0027 scenario.We are in the process of discussing our future partnership with the EU, and in March we reached agreement on the terms of an implementation period that will start on 30 March 2019 and last until 31 December 2020, which will see our market access continue on current terms.A clear priority is to maintain continuity in our relationships with third countries as we exit the EU, and we\u0027ve agreed with the EU that they will notify the other parties to international agreements that, during the implementation period, the United Kingdom is to be treated as a Member State for the purposes of these agreements.This is in line with the draft Withdrawal Agreement text published before March European Council.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We don\u0027t trust her.Ms O\u0027Grady said Brexit-supporting ministers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove were not bothering to disguise their real agenda.They\u0027ve already briefed their media friends that Brexit is a great opportunity to get rid of the EU Working Time Directive.That means limits on long working hours, the right to paid holidays and protection for night workers, and we\u0027re kidding ourselves if we think they\u0027ll stop there.We respect the referendum result, but we want a deal with the EU that protects jobs, livelihoods and rights at work that keep pace with our friends elsewhere in Europe.Downing Street said that the Government\u0027s proposals for a backstop solution for the Irish border would be published shortly.Theresa May\u0027s official spokesman confirmed that the proposal would include a time limit on any interim arrangement to keep the border open in the absence of a more permanent solution, but declined to give further details.He stressed that the Government does not believe that the backstop option will have to be put into effect, as ministers think that a better customs arrangement can be agreed before the UK\u0027s withdrawal from the EU.PA political editor Andy Woodcock has written a helpful explainer on the different options for Britain\u0027s future relationship with the EU.The Government\u0027s positionBritain should withdraw from the European single market and customs union, to enable it to strike new trade deals around the world. It should forge a new deep and special partnership with the EU27, with free trade and close security links.Who supports it? Theresa May and a large majority of Conservative MPs, along with some Labour rebels.The Labour positionLabour wants Britain to remain in a customs union with the EU after Brexit, to ensure tariff-free access and frictionless trade with the remaining 27 members. Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s new policy would also make full access to the EU internal market an objective in Brexit negotiations.Who supports it? Labour\u0027s leadership, including Mr Corbyn and shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, who are expected to be backed by most of the party\u0027s MPs.The \u0027soft Brexit\u0027 optionKeeping Britain inside the customs union and the single market, to maintain the closest possible ties with the EU. Amendments passed by the House of Lords, and due for an MPs\u0027 vote next Tuesday, would require the Government to try to negotiate a customs union and continued membership - alongside non-EU countries like Norway - of the European Economic Area (EEA).Who supports it? A majority of peers, along with europhile MPs from all parties linked to the Open Britain campaign, such as Tory former minister Anna Soubry. A substantial number of Labour MPs, including Chuka Umunna, believe the party should back the cross-party Lords amendments, despite orders from the leadership to abstain in the EEA vote.The \u0027Exit from Brexit\u0027 optionOffering voters the opportunity to reverse their decision to leave the European Union.Who supports it? This is the official policy of the Liberal Democrats and the favoured outcome of the Best for Britain pressure group and the People\u0027s Vote campaign for a second referendum on the final Brexit deal.The \u0027No Deal\u0027 optionBritain leaves the EU without any agreement on future relations, and trades on World Trade Organisation terms.Who supports it? Only a relatively small number of committed eurosceptics in Parliament regard this as their preferred result, but many MPs - particularly on the Tory benches - believe the Government should be preparing for the possibility of a no deal exit in order to strengthen the UK\u0027s hand in negotiations with Brussels.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

My name is Sajid Javid, I’m the home secretary,” he said.\u0026nbspIn an attempt to bat away the issue, Mr Javid also attacked the MCB, which was the first group to write to the party calling for an inquiry, claiming they had associations with extremism and did not represent British Muslims.But Mr Amin said the same argument could not possibly be used against the Conservative Muslim Forum.He went on: “The CMF has members who are as integrated as you can get. We are lawyers, accountants, bankers and doctors.“We cannot be disparaged as closet extremists – if we are concerned then it is a serious problem.”In recent days a number of current and former Tory members have also contacted The Independent about their personal experiences of Islamophobia and racism in the party.A current activist in London, who has been a member for four years, said he has experienced discrimination throughout that time.In one example who said that a dinner hosted by his local Conservative association, five BME attendees were placed on one table at the far end of the room.When a complaint was raised the deputy leader of the group replied “he could not be racist because his girlfriend is black”.A former Tory activist from Ealing said he experienced harassment because of his faith which ultimately led him to leave the party.When he applied to be a councillor he was asked to attend a selection interview and, upon hearing that he had volunteered at a Muslim-led community organisation, one of the interviewers asked “if there was something he was not telling them”.Another interviewer quizzed the activist on his position on women participating in politics and being members of the workforce.“Naturally in your core belief women are not allowed to work – what is your opinion on that?” the activist said he was asked.He said he could not believe the line of questioning and after the interview no longer had a desire to represent the party.In another shocking anecdote, he said a councillor regularly “swore at him” and told him he was “not welcome” in the Conservatives.\u0026nbsp“I just remember feeling terrible when I walked out of there. It just was not a pleasant experience,” the activist told The Independent.“I’ve been bullied and harassed and I am mentally tired from this.”There have also been a number of incidents of Islamophobic and racist content posted on social media by councillors and party members, with 12 reports in the past two months.Stephen Ardley, a councillor on the Waveney District Council, was suspended after The Independent revealed he allegedly said it was “unbelievable” that a Muslim had been elected mayor of London and went on to describe those who voted for him as “blind”.\u0026nbsp“I think it’s unbelievable that a Muslim was actually elected the mayor of this great Christian country – oh wait, he’s Labour so the blind just vote red and left,” he apparently posted on Facebook.Councillor Ian Hibberd from Southampton was also suspended after he commented on a picture posted on social media uploaded by fellow Tory councillor Harmeet Singh Brar asking: “Why are you dressed like a p***?”Mr Brar, who is not Muslim, has now left the Conservative Party altogether saying it was due to “two years of bullying, harassment and racism”.He said the party’s decision to “investigate” the matter was a “get out”.“I felt when I spoke out about racism I was isolated and casted out. That was the major reason why I left” he told The Independent.\u0026nbspIn response to calls for an inquiry, a Conservative Party spokesperson said: “We have introduced a new code of conduct covering all forms of discrimination and we take all allegations seriously.“The party has acted quickly when presented with evidence of inappropriate behaviour, suspending those involved and launching immediate investigations.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I don\u0027t have to be very clever, I don\u0027t have to know that much, I do just have to be calm.”That comment followed the Brexit Secretary’s claim that the pre-Christmas agreement with the EU was not “legally enforceable” without a future trade deal - which he later dropped.Mr Davis was also caught up in the furore over his boast of 58 sector-by-sector Brexit impact assessments, which he then acknowledged did not exist.The former head of the Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings, once branded the Brexit Secretary as “thick as mince” and “as lazy as a toad”.The latest gaffe comes in the final episode of Channel 4’s “Carry on Brussels” documentary, to be broadcast on Wednesday.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I find it particularly interesting that the Israeli tweet uses a meme with women to react to the Ayatollah\u0026nbspKhamenei’s tweet.”Israel’s Mean Girls gif had been retweeted more than 9,000 times and liked more than 27,000 times within a day of being posted.The Twitter exchange came amid growing tensions in the Middle East since Donald Trump announced the US was withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposing sanctions on Iran.\u0026nbspOn Tuesday, Benjamin\u0026nbspNetanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, sought to convince European states to abandon the deal, claiming Tehran’s threats to increase uranium enrichment capacity showed it still planned to destroy Israel.Britain, France and Germany are scrambling to\u0026nbspsave the accord, under which Iran\u0026nbsppromised to curb its nuclear programme in return for lifted sanctions.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It is not possible.Benoit Rochet, deputy chief executive at the Port of Calais, has also expressed concern that port authorities have not be told exactly Brexit will mean for them.Mr Rochet said: The most important problem is we know that there is Brexit but we don\u0027t exactly know what Brexit means.

Because 17.4million of us voted to leave, to take back control of our money, our laws and our borders.Before the referendum vote, Parliament decided — quite rightly — that the British people had the right to decide whether we should leave the EU.That is why Parliament passed the Referendum Act and voted to trigger Article 50.And it is why both major political parties agreed in last year’s general election to abide by the referendum decision.Liam Fox says Britain has proved the doubters wrongThere is also great strength in the UK economy that should give us reassurance as we move towards a more independent future.Remember the dire consequences predicted if the British people decided to vote to leave? We were told investors would desert us.What happened?Last year we landed more inward investment projects than ever before, a vote of confidence from the international financial community.We were told we would face an employment crisis.What happened?Employment is up by 600,000 since before the referendum to 32.34million, with record numbers in work.Our manufacturing order books are at their highest for years and our exports have risen by about ten per cent in the past year.Remember how jobs would flood out of the City of London to Paris and Frankfurt?What happened?Last year saw more venture capital on tech, including financial technology, coming to London than all of Germany, France, Spain and Ireland combined.Thankfully, the British people had the sense and courage to ignore the prophets of doom.We can rightly be confident and optimistic about our future outside the EU — and the PM has set out a vision of what that will look like. The UK already has enormous advantages in a competitive global economy.Our system of law is admired across the globe. Our skilled workforce and universities are world class.We have fantastic research and development facilities, some of the best innovators and we are leaders in the digital revolution.And we speak English and are in the right time zone to trade with Asia in the morning and the Americas in the afternoon.The UK is in a strong position. We are not the dependent and supplicant country some would have us believe.We are a leading member of the Commonwealth, a grouping of 53 countries that is home to one third of the world’s population and half of the globe’s top 20 emerging cities.We are one of the highest contributors to Nato, have a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and are members of the G7 and G20.The UK’s future is, and needs, to be global. Based on International Monetary Fund data, it has been calculated that in the next ten to 15 years, 90 per cent of global economic growth will originate from outside the EU.That is where we must concentrate our efforts for exports and investment, alongside maintaining our ties of prosperity and security with our European neighbours. The well-being of future generations depends upon it.Sometimes it is difficult for people in Britain, or the rest of Europe, to grasp the scale of this growth.But when we understand that by 2025, China, alone, will have 221 cities with more than a million people, while the whole of the European continent will have 35, we can begin to see a fuller picture.Of course, the EU will continue to be an important economic and trade partner and we want to have a full, open and comprehensive trade agreement with it that puts the prosperity of European people before the ideology of the EU bureaucracy.But the truth is that our trade relationship with the EU has been changing over the years, since well before the referendum.In 2006, 54 per cent of our exports went to the EU. That has now fallen to 44 per cent, as markets elsewhere have expanded faster.One of the main benefits of Brexit, and being outside the Customs Union, will be having an independent trade policy for the first time in more than 40 years — made in Britain, for Britain.We need to have policies that ensure we are able to take advantage of the opportunities that will lie ahead as Asia and Africa develop growing middle classes with an appetite for the high-quality goods and services Britain provides.We cannot allow our future options to be constrained by the patterns of the past.As we leave the EU, we will take up our independent seat at the World Trade Organisation, the governing body of global trade.We will be champions of the free trading system that has helped take a billion people out over abject poverty over the past generation — one of the greatest achievements in human history.We believe protectionism will always fail and that spreading prosperity through trade is the best route to the global stability and security that is in all our interests.The UK can, and should, be a leader in that quest.It is time for our country to raise its level of ambition, take pride in our achievements and help shape our global future, joining the PM and the Government in delivering a Brexit that works for everyone — in Britain and beyond.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We don’t want to compromise,” he confessed to Vice online news. Now we all know. Our grovelling attempt to buy a friendly, friction-free and costly trade deal was doomed from the start.Brussels was never going to let Britain be better off outside.The Commission was determined to punish us for daring to leave. For believers in ever-closer union this an immutable article of faith.Abandoning the True Path is a heresy punishable by economic death.If we make it a success, we put the sacred Project in peril.In fact we should welcome Barnier’s harsh honesty.It provides an urgent wake-up call to dithering Theresa May who seems to favour a deal at any price.The PM’s weakness has made Britain a soft touch for Brussels and renegade Tories.Mrs May, a Remainer, has surrounded herself with a Downing Street coven of pro-EU fanatics and Whitehall mandarins who want her to cave in.She has a defeatist chief whip who keeps telling her she can’t win Commons votes against Brexit wreckers.And she is terrified of Chancellor Phil Hammond, a defiant Remainer who sabotaged spending on No Deal plans.Meanwhile, officials stoke fake news about a food, fuel and medicines crisis while the tax man invents a ludicrous annual £20BILLION customs bill for British exporters.Theresa May’s government is scaring itself to death.But a Sun on Sunday poll reveals voters don’t buy this rubbish.Most think, rightly, Theresa May has made a total hash of negotiations and must be replaced as PM when we leave next March.Mrs May is a rabbit in the headlights — aware of the trap she is walking into but paralysed by indecision over ways to escape.She seems to believe the EU Commission really can cripple one of the world’s major economies, wreck security ties and revive terrorism in Northern Ireland.And she is ready to cough up a gigantic £39BILLION of taxpayers’ cash for the privilege of surrendering — a prospect which enrages Remainers as much as Brexiteers.Paying that monstrous ransom in return for national humiliation would condemn the Tories to the scrapheap at the next election and hand the country over to a Corbyn-led Marxist nightmare.Ambitious Barnier — a preposterous puffed-up plutocrat — thinks he’s got it in the bag.EU needs all the friends – and money – it can get.In fact, his arrogance is causing alarm among EU leaders who want a deal — and offers Britain a chance to escape not just intact but in triumph.Barnier may have the support of France which has throughout history seen Britain as the great enemy.But many other countries — including Sweden, Holland, Italy and even Germany — regard the UK as their best customer.Trade is two-way traffic. Trade wars are bad news, as Donald Trump is starting to prove.Theresa May may be super-cautious but she has surely learned that boldness pays.She earned her leadership spurs by taking on Police Federation thugs. And she won global credit by standing up to Vladimir Putin over the Salisbury nerve agent poisonings.She must apply those lessons to this month’s crucial EU Council where member states gather to consider Britain’s future, just as Italy bursts into flames.The PM has a choice.She can accept an unpopular compromise which will unravel disastrously if British voters think they’ve been conned. Or she can march into talks with a clear, fair, take-it-or-leave-it offer to Europe from a valued economic and security ally.Her £39bn cheque is the trump card. With Greece destitute, Italy imploding and Austria, Poland and Hungary near revolt over immigration, the EU needs all the friends — and money — it can get.European leaders would have to decide whether to accept the deal or see Mrs May take everything off the table, including that mouth- watering £39bn pile of crisp Bank of England notes.Forget about “cliff edges”. The EU desperately needs that cash. There would be a stampede to stop Mrs May reaching the exit.Now it seems most if not all those casualties could have escaped if they had not been penned in their flats by fire-brigade diktat.We raise our hats to the fire service teams who risked death in this hideous blaze.

Imagine how fast Tory fortunes, shored up by Leave voters, will nose-dive if Brexit is fatally wounded.Remainers already blame them for holding the referendum. Leavers will blame them for negating 17.4million votes.There is only one solution. Tory Remainers must put aside their personal views and respect the manifesto promises they stood on last year.When Home Secretary Sajid Javid says it will cost lives, he’s not exaggerating. He’s pointing out the reality of Brussels turning its back on the peerless UK ­security services it relies so heavily on.EU bureaucrats plainly consider a few more terrorist victims mere collateral damage in their zeal to punish us.This is the truth behind the “happy, inclusive” EU of Remainer fantasies.It is a hard-nosed trading cabal, run mafia-style by unelected bullies treating voters as cannon fodder.IT would be an act of national self-harm for MPs to reject a third Heathrow runway.Transport Secretary Chris Grayling is poised to give it the nod, possibly today.

With the ban now becoming law, we are delivering on our commitment.Anyone caught making or selling zombie knives now faces up to 4 years in prison.On the governments list of banned knives and weapons, it describes zombie knives as a knife with a cutting edge, a serrated edge and images or words suggesting it is used for violence.The knives have been banned in England and Wales, and Northern Ireland are seeking to implement similar legislation.The knives have been used in two high-profile crimes this week.On June 1 footage emerged of a cyclist using a zombie knife to try and smash the window of a car in an apparent road rage row.And yesterday a moped gang wielding a zombie knife and hammer raided a luxury watch shop on London’s Regent Street. Alf Hitchcock, an expert on knife crime at the National Police Chiefs’ Council, said: “Zombie knives are absolutely horrific weapons.”He added: “There is no place for knife crime within society and this ban is further commitment to keeping communities safe.”At least 37 people have been fatally stabbed - and 62 overall killed - in London since the beginning of the year."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000411368002.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"dennis rodman basketball north korea kim jong un married himself women","story":"Its fair to say Dennis Rodman is not your everyday sports star - and his life story is as shocking as he was brilliant on the court.Dennis Keith Rodman was born in Trenton, New Jersey, in 1961 to Shirley and Philander Rodman - who was later to ditch his family and move to the Philippines.Rodman has so many brothers and sisters his dad lost count. Its reported he has either 26 or 28 siblings on his fathers side.After an unhappy childhood the shy and introverted youngster left school measuring just 5ft 6ins and became a janitor at Dallas International Airport.However, after a bizarre height spurt a family friend tipped off the head Basketball coach of nearby Cooke County College.Within a year he was a college sports star and his outstanding playing stats started catching the eyes of NBA scouts.It was the start of a sporting career which would see non-conformist Rodman change the image of basketball forever.Throughout the 1990s he was one of the NBAs biggest stars famed for his on-court skills and off-court fashion sense, outlandish hairstyles and wild personal life...Rodmans outrageous sex life is the stuff of legend - and he really does claim to have done it all.In his 1997 book Bad As I Wanna Be Rodman tells how he didnt have sex until he was 20 when a prostitute did him and his friends for twenty bucks.However, since then it is fair to say he has made up for lost time.He claimed while he was dating Madonna in the mid 1990s, the pop queen used to send him x-rated faxes begging to have his baby.Then there was the time Rodman broadcast himself having sex with six women in a Hamptons hotel room after he forgot to turn off a cordless microphone in his pocket.The basketball giant also claimed his sex sessions with film star wife Carmen Electra used to last for days.The pair got hitched in November 1998 at the Little Chapel of Flowers in Las Vegas. Carmen filed for divorce the following April.In his book I Should Be Dead By Now  Rodman devoted entire sections telling all kinds of weird sex stories - the craziest one involved him bedding a bride-to-be at her hen party.He also claims to have broken his penis THREE TIMES during sex - with one lover thinking she had killed him because of all the blood.The 6ft 7ins sports legend has since claimed to have bedded 2,000 women but considers about 500 of them to be gold diggers.Finally declaring himself fed up with women he then claimed he was bisexual and married himself in a bizarre ceremony to promote yet another book.Rodman played for the Detroit Pistons, San Antonio Spurs, Chicago Bulls, LA Lakers and the Dallas Mavericks in a topsy-turvy career which lasted 12 years.He was nicknamed “The Worm” famous for his aggressive defensive and rebound abilities.During his time at Detroit became one of the elite teams in the NBA. The club won the championship in 1989 and again in 1990.However, Rodman ruffled a lot of feathers in 1987 when he claimed that the only reason Larry Bird won three MVP awards was because hes white.Rodman was selected to the 1990 NBA All-Star team and tapped as defensive player of the year that same season. In 1992 he won the first of seven consecutive rebounding crowns.In 1993, following the retirement of Daly, Rodmans relationship with the Pistons organisation soured and he was traded to the San Antonio Spurs.Prior to the 1995-96 season, Rodman was traded again, this time to the Chicago Bulls, where hed go on to team up with Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen to win three consecutive NBA titles.However while at the Bulls he landed himself in hot water after headbutting a referee on the court - which landed him with a $200,000 fine.In 1997 he hit the headlines again after kicking a TV cameraman in the groin after he took a tumble on court.Following his tenure in Chicago, Rodman signed with the Los Angeles Lakers for a brief run late in the 1999 season. He concluded his playing career the following year with the Dallas Mavericks.In all, Rodman would finish with five NBA championships, two All-Star appearances, and twice be named the leagues top defensive player. In 2011, he was inducted into the NBA Hall of Fame.During his basketball career Rodman is reported to have earned $30m in wages alone. Hes now said to be worth just $500,000.During his time as an NBA star he is also believed to have earned tens of millions in lucrative sponsorship, TV and book deals.However in recent years his assets have been eaten up by a series of unfortunate business decisions and sometimes just bad luck.In 2012, he appeared in court to face charges that he owed more than $800,000 in child support to an ex wife.Rodmans lawyers claimed at the time that the former superstar was completely broke and could not pay a dime.Since then he has appeared in numerous reality TV shows, including Celebrity Big Brother in the UK, Celebrity Mole, which he won taking the $220,000 first prize, and Celebrity Apprentice in 2013.He has worked on voice-overs for The Simpsons and appeared in the TV show ‘3rd Rock From The Sun’.He has also appeared in several films and briefly had his own MTV reality chat show - The Rodman World Tour.Rodman made his first trip to North Korea in 2013 with Vice Media correspondent Ryan Duffy, to host basketball exhibitions.He met Kim Jong-un there and later declared him a friend for life before suggesting President Barack Obama call the leader due to their shared love of basketball.Describing his bromance, Rodman told Good Morning Britain: I hang out with him all the time.We laugh, we sing karaoke, we do a lot of cool things together like skiing and riding horses.At Pyongyang’s Indoor Stadium in 2014, he previously met the leader Kim Jong-un while watching an exhibition match between US players and North Korean players.In July, 2013, Rodman told Sports Illustrated: My mission is to break the ice between hostile countries. Why it’s been left to me to smooth things over, I don’t know.Since then he has made a few visits to the country - with the most recent being June 2017, taking the tally up to around five trips.He was sponsored by a currency for legalised marijuana and wore branded t-shirts to travel in.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The legal limit for a pilot is 20mg.Monaghan today appeared at Crawley Magistrates Court to plead guilty to the reporting for duty as a pilot when his level of alcohol was over the prescribed limit.Emlyn Jones, defending, said his client drank the booze well in advance of the eight-hour alcohol rule - known as bottle to throttle.Mr Jones told the court: He was not due to take up his responsibilities as pilot of the plane on take-off.He would not have been charged with taking up the role of pilot until three- and-a-half hours into the flight.Mr Jones told the court Monaghan had been on a overnight flight as a passenger the night before, and had spent the day without food or sleep.He added: He turned up for work appalled, astonished and horrified that he was still over the limit.Mr Jones said his client was only a fraction over the drink-drive limit of 80mg per 100ml of blood, and that Monaghan was not falling over drunk and no harm was caused.This was rejected by chair of the bench Dr David Wiggins, who said: I have to say the comparison to drink-driving is somewhat spurious in these circumstances.A pilot in a Boeing 777 is somewhat different from driving on the road, so we are completely ignoring that comment.Asking for the court to consider sentencing Monaghan on Wednesday, Mr Jones, said: He has thrown away the only career he has ever known.He has been a pilot his whole life, and that has gone.Sending the case to crown court, Dr Wiggins told the ex-pilot: I think you need to prepare yourself there is a very, very high chance that it will be an immediate custodial sentence.The 12-hour flight, from Gatwick to Mauritius, was scheduled to leave at 8.20pm, but the plane was left waiting at the gate while airline staff looked for a third pilot.Monaghan is due to be sentenced at Lewes Crown Court on June 12.A spokeswoman for British Airways said: This behaviour is completely unacceptable and not what we expect from our highly professional fleet of pilots.The safety and security of our customers and colleagues is always our top priority."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Lords1.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"peers given telling off for looking like theyre having a snooze in the chamber","story":"A shirty memo from the Governments chief whip in the Lords has been sent around complaining that the high standards of the upper chamber are not being met.Some older members of the House of Lords are regularly seen to be resting their eyes during debates - and several MPs have suffered from the snoozes in the Commons too.Lord Taylor of Holbeach wrote in an email to Tory peers: It has been observed by members of our House that, over recent months, conduct in the chamber has not been of the standard we should expect.He goes on to list a string of offences, including falling asleep in the chamber, audible conversations, and shouting from their seats, The Times reported.The grievances have also been circulated with their opposition members on the Labour and Lib Dem benches too.One Labour source confirmed they would be reminded of the rules. They told the paper: Sometimes they really are closing their eyes.Others are leaning into the monitor to hear more closely and it looks like theyve keeled over.MPs have also been known to look as if they are having a kip too.Earlier this year Tory MP Sir Desmond Swayne nodded off right behind the cameras as Ken Clarke was speaking in front of him.The Conservative MP for New Forest West tried to wake himself up by giving his head a shake, but tiredness overcame him and he could be seen slowly slipping down the green bench.When Sir Desmond finally jerked awake after his forty winks he he smiled to himself, hiding a sheepish grin behind his hands.The pair were talking about the EU Withdrawal Bill in the Commons, but Sir Desmond blamed an early morning swim for his tiredness and later apologised.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some new road laws have already come into place, with more set to change the way we look after our vehicles later this year. We\u0027ve joined forces with the experts at Halfords to round up the essential bits of information all drivers need to know. So read on to stay up to date with the latest updates to British laws with this essential guide.  1. Learners can use the motorway now   For the first time learner drivers are allowed to take lessons on the motorway. Instructors must be properly licensed and have dual controls. This law should help learners become better prepared for driving on high speed roads - making our motorways safer. This follows a change in December which saw using a sat nav form part of the driving test. This was partly introduced because around a quarter of accidents involving new drivers are caused by them being distracted trying while using one. Tip: For added peace of mind, fit a dashcam. While they won\u0027t prevent an accident, investing in one can offer peace of mind. Having one means that if something were to happen, you\u0027d have video evidence to back up your version of events. Because of this, they can even be used to lower your insurance premium. The Garmin 55 Dash Cam, above, is excellent, can wirelessly send footage to your phone and has amazing, better-than-HD quality video and superb low-light performance. 2. Your diesel must be clean  The quest to clean up diesel continues as MOTs are expanded to check particulate filters. If your car produces any visible smoke during the MOT then it will fail. Similarly if your particulate filter has been tampered with then you will also fail. Make sure your diesel is running well and as cleanly as possible before your test. Tip: Some diesel problems are complicated, but make sure your car has the right oil levels and is using the correct oil. Use the Halfords Oil Finder to pick the right oil for your car - or pop in to your local Halfords store for advice from their expert staff. You can also check the Halfords MOT Advice or book an MOT at a Halfords Autocentre.  3. There are penalties for driving in the wrong motorway lane   Smart motorways have lanes which can be opened and closed via electronic signs on the overhead gantry. This allows for better traffic flow during peak times by using the hard shoulder for additional capacity. If, however, you ignore the signs when a lane is closed you will be liable for a fixed penalty of \u0026pound100 and three points. On many motorways you\u0027ll be automatically photographed if you break this rule and you\u0027ll get a fine as well as notice of penalty points in the post. Tip: A sat nav won\u0027t help with smart motorways, but they can alert you to possible traffic delays and reroute you. And with lifetime map updates, the Garmin Drive, above, is a great way to navigate.  4. Low tyre pressure is now an MOT fail  Before you go to your MOT make sure you\u0027ve checked your tyre pressures are correct. MOT testers are on the lookout for tyres that are underinflated and aside from that it\u0027s important for safety to make sure your tyres are correctly inflated.  Tip: Make sure you have a tyre pressure checker at home so you can keep an eye on your tyres. A footpump or electric pump is a great way to keep tyres at the right pressure. 5. It\u0027s very easy to fail an MOT for a broken car bulb - get a Free Car Check to make sure they\u0027re working As many as 30 per cent of MOT fails are because of lighting or signalling problems. So make sure your horn works and walk around the car checking all the lights – make sure the car is parked safely and the handbrake is on first, or you can reverse up against a wall to check brake and reverse lights.  Tip: Halfords FREE Car Check will ensure your car bulbs are all working as they should. The check also includes:  Wiper Blades Check Car Bulb Check Battery Check Engine Oil Check Windscreen Chip Check Plus a FREE Screenwash Top Up  Just pop in to a store or book online now. 6. Headlight washers are crucial now  It might seem odd, but if your car has headlight washers fitted, and was registered after September 2009, then they must work. Tip: Halfords will top up your screen wash for free as part of the Free Car Check. The MOT also requires your wipers be fully working, and Halfords can check those too.

Dagenham legend Eileen Pullen, 88, is delighted that her great-granddaughter’s generation are prepared to continue her fight for equality. “I’m all for it,” she says. “Things are a lot worse than I thought, women have a big fight in front of them. You can’t be frightened. “If you think you’re entitled to more pay, go for it.”  Eileen was one of the leaders when 185 female machinists at Dagenham, East London, went on strike in 1968 demanding an equal pay grading to their male colleagues. Tomorrow marks 50 years since the day the women, who stitched car seat covers, walked out. The covers soon ran out, halting production across the plant – proving just how integral their role was in the car manufacturing process. Their landmark action, immortalised in the 2010 film Made in Dagenham, is widely credited as a catalyst for the Equal Pay Act two years later. Yet despite being enshrined in law, equal pay has yet to be achieved in workplaces across the country.  The battle fought by Eileen and her colleagues continues today, as bosses are finally being forced to open up about the 18.4% gender pay gap that means women effectively work for free for two months each year. Fellow Dagenham striker Gwen Davis says: “It makes me angry and sad. Should we have to keep fighting for everything?” Gwen, 85, of Romford, East London, is frustrated that women are still subjected to lower pay and harassment at work. Like Eileen, she fully supports the high-profile campaigns that are calling out such ill treatment. “It should all be out in the open,” she says. “Why should a man think he has a right to your body?  “This year is about a lot of things, including equal pay – but overall, for women to be treated with respect. “Now women are protesting it’s revived my hope things will start to change. Women are strong compared to what they used to be, but it shouldn’t have taken 50 years. “I don’t think many people really understand what the word feminist means, still.” Pal Eileen, of nearby Rainham, encourages great-granddaughter Katie, a 20-year-old trainee nurse, to stand her ground. Eileen says: “I’ve been mad this year. I tell Katie to stick up for herself. I say to all women, stand up for yourself, go for it, call people out. We have to.”  Eileen and Gwen have never stopped fighting for equality. In February they were on the Bafta red carpet with actress Gemma Arterton, who starred in the West End musical version of Made in Dagenham. They wore black alongside the star in support of the Time’s Up movement against sexual harassment. They believe tomorrow’s anniversary is an important opportunity to speak out for what they so passionately believe in – especially coming as it does in the centenary year of women getting the vote. Although they shrug off any \u0026shysuggestion that they were personally courageous, back in 1968 it was undoubtedly brave to walk out of Ford.  Support was not always forthcoming – especially when their actions led to the plant closing down and the men getting laid off too, leaving hundreds of families strapped for cash. But they both say they never doubted. “It was difficult but we had to do it,” says Eileen. “We had no hesitation. We all got together, we asked for a meeting, hands were shown and out we walked. We were very angry. Although looking back you wonder how you did do it.” The situation the women were fighting was around grading rather than pay, initially. Despite their job requiring two years’ training, the female machinists were classified as unskilled B-grade workers, the same as floor sweepers, with the equivalent pay and pensions to cleaners.  Every year they would ask to be re-classified as C-grade semi-skilled workers, which is how men with \u0026shyequivalent training were graded. But each year they were turned down. “We had skills the same as the men,” Gwen says. “Yet we were classed the same as the teenage boys who swept the floor.” The final straw was the discovery that some male workers were being paid extra to work on the machines at night – while women were forbidden from working nights or overtime. Both women were married and had children, but say they were lucky that their husbands did not work at Ford, so one source of income kept coming in during the strike.  Both men were supportive – Eileen says her husband would put the tea on when she went off to protests. “He knew we were fighting for our rights,” she says. However, other families were not so lucky, which is why some hostility crept in. “Some said, ‘Get back to work’,” recalls Eileen. “They said we were putting the men out of work. We had to let it go over our heads.” Ultimately, for all their efforts, the women won only a partial victory. Employment Secretary Barbara Castle promised a pay rise bringing them up to 92% of the unskilled men’s wage – an improvement on their existing 85%, but still far from equal pay or the grading change they demanded. Gwen says the women had little choice but to accept the deal.

The Labour leader claimed the Tory government had ripped up its own timetable, just like our shambolic privatised railways in a withering PMQs clash.  He added: Which will last longer, the Northern Rail franchise or her premiership?  Mr Corbyn surprised onlookers by devoting this week\u0027s Prime Minister\u0027s Questions to Brexit - despite a battle erupting in his own party.  This morning Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer was forced to slap down unhelpful Labour MPs who want to stay in the \u0027soft Brexit\u0027 EEA zone. But Mr Corbyn insisted it was the Conservatives who were split - and Mrs May dodged a string of his questions.  The Prime Minister refused to say when her crucial White Paper, outlining her plan for Britain\u0027s relationship with the EU, will be published. She insisted she agrees with Brexit Secretary David Davis after reports he is fed up of slow progress and has had to redraft the White Paper five times. She refused to answer whether it will be published before this month\u0027s EU summit and whether MPs will have a chance to debate it first. She refused to say what progress had been made in choosing between the government\u0027s two current options for customs.  She also refused to deny Mr Corbyn\u0027s claims that the government was considering a bonkers 10-mile \u0027buffer zone\u0027 along the Irish border. But she did answer one question - whether she still intends to leave the EU in March 2019 and complete a transition period before 2021. Yes, the Prime Minister replied in a rare one-word answer. Mr Corbyn told MPs: When it comes to Brexit, this government has delivered more delays and more cancellations than Northern Rail. The government\u0027s white paper is delayes. Its customs proposals have been cancelled. And it’s ripped up its own timetable - just like our shambolic privatised railways.  This government’s incompetence threatens our economy, businesses, jobs and our communities. So my question to the Prime Minister is this - which will last longer, the Northern Rail franchise or her premiership?

The \u0027backstop\u0027 would continue some Brussels trading rules beyond 2020 if there\u0027s no deal for the Northern Ireland border. But Brexiteers fear the plan will keep the UK in purgatory because there\u0027s no set end date. A document - to be tabled in Brussels and published as soon as tomorrow - was circulated to senior ministers this morning and briefed within hours to news outlets including the Times,  and BBC. It reportedly says the backstop must be time-limited - yet also says it will be in place until another deal is found.  This would echo the deal that was signed off in a legal document by the UK and Brussels earlier this year. Brexiteers today claimed they had been bounced into a decision with mad speed and no chance to meet.  Brexit Secretary David Davis is one of those mounting a backlash, according to the .  The row centres on what happens when Britain\u0027s \u0027transition period\u0027 - continuing current EU rules - ends on 31 December 2020. If there\u0027s no deal by then, a \u0027backstop\u0027 will kick in to prevent Northern Ireland automatically getting a hard border with the Republic.  This would stop a return to customs checks and border posts, which campaigners fear will spark sectarian violence. But it comes at a price - which could involve keeping the whole of the UK inside the EU\u0027s Customs Union. This would leave Britain unable to strike its own trade deals around the world. Theresa May\u0027s official spokesman confirmed today the backstop would include a time limit, but declined to give further details. He stressed that the Government does not believe that the backstop option will have to be put into effect. But a senior Labour source hit out at the approach.  The source pointed out Mrs May is refusing to promise a \u0027White Paper\u0027, her Brexit plan, will be published this month.

The Prime Minister has promised a “detailed, ambitious and precise” government White Paper, outlining her plan for Britains’ future relationship with the EU. The paper was intended to put Britain on the front foot when it comes to the next crucial set of negotiations on the final Brexit deal. But sustained Cabinet infighting is reported to have delayed the publication of the paper, as Mrs May’s senior ministers failed to agree on the finer points of our relationship with the customs union and the Northern Irish border.  As a result, there are rumblings that the paper won’t be published until AFTER the forthcoming European Commission summit - which begins on June 28th. Which is pretty awkward. And the Prime Minister today repeatedly refused to put a date on the plan’s publication.   First Jeremy Corbyn asked not once, but twice for a date.  She refused to answer whether it would be published the summit or whether MPs will have a chance to debate it first. Later in PMQs, Labour MP Steve Reed gave her a third chance to answer the question.   Who won PMQs? Jeremy Corbyn delivers a Brexit bashing to a leaden-footed Theresa May  He said: “The cabinet agreed to publish a Brexit white paper ahead of this month’s crunch EU council meeting, to allow the government to negotiate. The Brexit Secretary said it would be detailed, ambitious and precise. “So will she confirm whether the Brexit White Paper will be published before the EU council meeting, or is she unable to negotiate for the UK because she’s negotiating with her own cabinet?” "},{"url":null,"title":"why me samantha cameron reveals","story":"News\u0027Why did it have to be me?\u0027 Samantha Cameron reveals what she hated most about life in Downing StreetDavid Cameron\u0027s wife has opened up in a brutally honest interview about her six years in Britain\u0027s most powerful terraced home\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByDan BloomPolitical reporter11:49, 6 JUN 2018Updated12:07, 6 JUN 2018NewsSam Cam didn\u0027t take naturally to No10 - especially the silly waving (Image: REUTERS)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSamantha Cameron has revealed she found Downing Street life bizarre and struggled with waving cheerily to the cameras.

But it\u0027s not because the brave 27-year-old is afraid of flying or has a habit of getting lost in new places. It\u0027s because she is one of the few people in the world with no fingerprints - which has led to problems at airports. It\u0027s interesting when you try to go to America and they try and take your fingerprints and you say you haven\u0027t got any, said Heather. I went to New York with my mum in 2005 and it was our turn to show our passports. Mum did her fingerprints and when it came to me I said \u0027I don\u0027t have any fingerprints\u0027. He said \u0027Don\u0027t be silly, everybody has fingerprints\u0027. I showed him my hands and he just looked shocked and tried to find me on his computer. He said \u0027Amputee?\u0027 I said, \u0027No, I\u0027ve got hands, they\u0027re here. I just don\u0027t have any fingerprints\u0027. I was taken off to a police room and I was absolutely terrified and burst into tears. Heather was born a \u0027butterfly child\u0027 - a term given to children with a rare condition that makes the skin so fragile it\u0027s compared to the wings of a butterfly.  She has had no skin on her back for 21 years and gets up every morning knowing the day ahead involves hours of bandage changes to protect her open wounds. She regularly wakes up with new blisters that have grown overnight like bubblewrap and need to be popped with sterilised needles. And her daily routine involves attaching a tube to her stomach that feeds her for 10 hours as she sleeps at night. Heather also has to put a lens in her right eye every day after an infected blister ate away at her own in 2007, forcing her to have a corneal transplant. But despite her struggles, she remains incredibly defiant. It affects my life from the minute I get up in the morning to the minute I go to bed, she said. I get the odd comments when I\u0027m out on the streets like \u0027urgh\u0027 but it\u0027s ignorance. She added: On bad days I\u0027m grumpy and I cry. I don\u0027t do anything, I just cry and think \u0027why me?\u0027  There are days when I want to give up. But then I have to have to accept it and have a reality check as it could be worse. Heather\u0027s mum Wendy was shocked and heartbroken when her baby emerged with no skin on her left hand or right foot, and doctors explained her condition. Heather has recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (EB), a skin disorder that causes it to become very fragile and creates painful blisters with any trauma or friction. The life-limiting condition also means she gets blisters inside her eyes and down her throat - a terrifying reality as it means her throat can close over and she needs surgery to open it out again. My back is red raw Research has shown that people with some types of EB face a hugely increased risk of an aggressive and ultimately fatal form of skin cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, according to the charity DEBRA, which supports people with the disorder and their families. They say it tends to occur at sites of increased blistering and scarring but research into the precise link between skin cancer and EB is ongoing.  Heather, from Swindon, has had the disease six times in the last two years.  She has recently had an operation to remove skin affected by cancer on her neck and has this month been given the all clear - for now. She says EB is the biggest condition no one has ever heard of - yet it shapes her life and means she plans her every move meticoulously. Growing up she has learnt to cope with staring, people complaining about her being in hot tubs and pools, accusations that her mum has let her get sunburnt, and struggles to be intimate in relationships. But Heather is unafraid of EB, is determined to raise awareness of it and help DEBRA.Explaining her condition to Mirror, Heather said: I haven\u0027t got any skin on my back, it\u0027s been open since I was six and has never healed in 21 years.  My back is red raw and sometimes it’s described as looking like a piece of liver. It’s sore and very itchy. I’m not supposed to scratch it, but I do sometimes which blisters and rips it. My hands are one of the worst areas, I don’t have any nails from where the skin on my hands has retracted - that\u0027s why they\u0027re so small. I also don\u0027t have any fingerprints. People are shocked and laugh, saying I could rob a bank. My arms don’t go straight because of the creases and scarring I have that restricts the skin. My feet are also different sizes - my right is a child size 12 and my left is an adult size 3. EB affects my skin internally and externally. I even get blisters in my eyes.  EB is life limiting, and it usually kills at quite a young age. With dystrophic there isn\u0027t an average age for life expectancy, it depends, everybody is different. Before Heather was born, her mum had no idea she would have EB. It was only when she came out with no skin on her left hand and right foot - which eventually healed on their own- that doctors diagnosed her. The charity DEBRA supported Wendy, 64, and put her in touch with parents of other sufferers so she could make sense of her daughter\u0027s condition. It was shocking for my mum, Heather said, revealing what she\u0027s learnt about her childhood. She’s told me I used to scream throughout the dressing changes.  It was horrible and heartbreaking for my mum when I\u0027d cry. As a child, mum wanted me to be as independent as possible but wanted to protect me as well. I couldn’t just go out with my friends because I needed help with my wheelchair. I used to swim but I just can’t anymore because my back just hurts too much. When Heather was six she had a gastronomy peg - a feeding tube - put into her stomach because she only weighed two and a half stone. She has used it every night since and it gives her a litre of a special ‘milk’ which contains the fibres, vitamins and minerals she needs to survive. Dr Helen Philips, Global Head of Medical Affairs for Amryt Pharma, said: “It’s estimated that there are more than 500,000 people living with EB worldwide, including around 2,000 people managed in specialist centres in the UK.  EB can be overwhelming and psychologically devastating to live with for both children and their carers.  Parents regularly find themselves as their child’s nurse and main carer, having to go through the difficult routine of changing bandages and dressing wounds while watching their child suffer with intolerable pain.  While significant advancements have been made in the development of therapies aimed at correcting the underlying genetic defects seen in EB, with the expectation that a cure for the disease will be developed in the long term, currently there is no cure for the condition.  Current wound care management involves daily or regular dressing changes to protect the skin, encourage healing and prevent infection.  Depending on disease severity, dressing changes can take several hours each day, often requiring the use of prescription medications to manage their excruciating pain.  The greatest need of those living with EB, and their carers, is to access better ways to manage the daily consequences of their condition, especially their wounds which are often associated with unbearable itch, pain and frequently become infected.  A cure is definitely something to aspire to achieving but short-term solutions are a priority – it is about the ‘here and now’.” As this tube goes into her stomach, she must lie on her back - and the constant friction between the bedsheets and her skin is why her back has never healed. \u2028Her neck is also affected and “anywhere that can rub, including the creases of my elbows, the backs of my legs where I sit down, my hips and armpits, Heather says. The friction from seams of clothing or anyone bumping into her when she\u0027s out can cause blisters or rip the skin off. There are days when I want to give up The young woman also has a restrictive oesophagus and narrow throat so has to be careful with what she eats. She is able to digest soft food but scratchy or chewy foods - for example crisps or steak- can scar her throat and cause it to contract. Until now, she\u0027s had six operations to release her throat after it has tightened.  Heather\u0027s mum helps her with the process of changing any bandages that need re-dressing and to pop any blisters. She applies treatment creams in the morning and has medication to control the pain throughout the day. The morning changes only take about 20 minutes, she says. But every evening her entire back is re-bandaged, a process which takes about two hours. She also has to put her eye drops in as part of her routine.  Heather, who has had several administrative jobs in the past but is currently focusing on her treatment, says: A blister breaks down into a wound - if I don’t feel it, it can be two or three times the size by the morning. If they rip, they need to be dressed. “It’s like bubble wrap, when you pierce it, it deflates. “I wouldn’t get to sleep without my medication, it puts me in a relaxed state. But I still get pain throughout the night. Doing the bandages is part of my daily life. I\u0027ve never known anything different. It\u0027s painful but I\u0027m used to the pain. It\u0027s just physically and mentally exhausting It\u0027s never going to change so I can\u0027t mope - it\u0027s not going to heal it. Throughout the day, Heather says she needs somebody with her to help with her wheelchair. She is able to walk around the house but for longer distances uses her chair. She has to plan outings around dressing changes, and is limited to only going away with people who she knows, trusts and can help with her routine.  Heather says one of the things she\u0027s had to deal with is people staring and making complaints about her. When I was younger on holiday people would tut and assume my mum had let me get sunburnt, she revealed. One complaint that sticks in my head was on a trip to Florida in 2009. There was a couple in the hot tub and after we got in, they got out. The manager then came and said to my mum \u0027what\u0027s wrong with her, maybe she shouldn\u0027t be in a hot tub\u0027. But my mum explained I was more likely to catch something from others than the other way round. It really hurt- to have somebody complain that I could be contagious was so hurtful. When I was 13 someone complained about me being in a pool in Spain as well which was so hurtful, she added. My mum carried leaflets in different languages on holiday to give to people and explained to children that I was born with poorly skin but that I was going to have it for life but that it’s OK.  Mum is incredible, I think that\u0027s where I get my strength from.  Heather has several other people who help her including her best friend Carly, Lorraine who is like her \u0027second mum\u0027 and her first friend Nikii. She is currently single but has had relationships in the past, although she says maintaining them has been difficult. Heather explained: The last one ended as I feel it was too much to deal with. EB is a massive part of my life and expecting somebody to bring that into their day to day life is quite a big thing. In relationships, the intimacy is difficult because I\u0027m not comfortable with my body. I\u0027m not dying. I\u0027m still incredibly fit The thing Heather finds most difficult to deal with though is the regular occurrence of skin cancer. She has had 15 operations in the last two and a half years after biopsies on lumps, abnormal scabs and blisters showed she had cancer on her right knee, right hand, her neck and her foot. The last surgery was on her neck at the start of this month, and she\u0027s relieved to have been given the all-clear.

On June 5 last year, Elley Taylor arrived at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth expecting to find her boyfriend, 20-year-old Marshall Arnott with a few broken bones.  He had been travelling home from work with two friends when their van overturned on the A38 in averse weather conditions.  The three men, who were aged under 25, were all killed. Now a year on, 20-year-old Elley Taylor, mum to Marshall\u0027s daughter Isla, has described how each day since his death has been a battle.  She was already suffering from post-natal depression at the time of the crash which made the trauma of losing Marshall and their dreams of living happily ever after even worse.  “You can’t sugar coat it,” she told Plymouth Live .  But she’s determined to be a good mother and says that Isla, who looks just like her dad, has got her though the darkest time of her life. Isla was just four months old when Marshall, along with his two friends Zachary Graham and Trevor Gorman were killed. “It was horrible,” Elley said. “All I wanted to do was run away and breathe but I had a baby to look after.  “Everyone says to me ‘It’s such a brilliant thing that you’ve got Isla - she’ll help you get though it’. “I had problems having a baby before so it was a really big thing for us. I was so thankful and so grateful but it almost felt unfair. “As soon as I had the baby something awful happened. I hated the world for a long time. “I spent all that time trying for a baby, I had operations for it, and then I had a baby but I lose him. “Even though it is a blessing and I couldn’t have done it without Isla, everyone else got to grieve – if they wanted to sleep for two weeks they could, if they wanted to cry they could cry if they wanted to go and forget it on a night out they could, but I spent the nights doing night feeds on my own for God knows how long. Elley first met Marshall, her affectionately nicknamed Marshmallow, at school aged 16.  They were “obsessed” with one another and the only time they ever spent apart was when she was in hospital. She says: “I loved that idea that I could say to my kids when I grew up that we were together since we were 16. “I used to say I was so fortunate that I found him so young. He was everything I ever wanted. I felt so lucky. I couldn’t fault him in any way. “He was an amazing dad and an amazing family, an amazing brother and an amazing son.”  Since Marshall was killed in the crash, Elley has described each day as a battle and revealed she has even had to fight suicidal thoughts.  Fearing she would one day take her own life to be with Marshall, she wrote a note to Isla explaining why.  “It was on my mind so strongly for so long. I was going down to the grave every day. It was horrible that he was there and I was here, she said. “It got to the point where I felt so empty. “People say it gets better in time but it doesn’t. You just learn not to cry so much. You learn to suffer in silence in a way. That pain will never go. “I want to be with him now. That’s a daily challenge for me to get through each day. There was a really bad time when I wrote a letter to Isla and I wrote a letter to my brother Curtis. “He was so happy. He was so loving and caring – he loved everything that he had in his life. I had post-natal depression. I was already very low and very depressed.  “Being at his grave and taking Isla down there. I used to think ‘why are you down there and I’m up here?’ “The plan was to live happily ever after. This feeling went on for so long. I wrote Isla the letter just in case. “It said that if she was reading this letter I was with daddy and it was okay. “I put it in an envelope and put it to one side.” Even now she feels she has to choose between being with her baby and being with the man she loved. “I want to be with both of them, she says. That’s a very hard thing to live with.  “I said it from the beginning – if I can chose any other way, other than him not being in that accident, that it would have been the three of us together. “I know that would have hurt a lot more people but I wouldn’t have been without him and Isla wouldn’t have been without a dad.” Despite Isla and Marshall only having a few precious months together, Elley is adamant that she will know her dad. Pictures of the young family are dotted around the flat and lovingly crafted photo albums fill the shelves. She says: “A lot of people around me didn’t like to hear his name. It was too fresh but I have his daughter – she had to know who her daddy is.  “I had to teach her so young to remember him. Now she can point him out in a photo. There’s a photo of him by the door. Every morning and every night we kiss him and say hello. “I hope he would be proud. “I feel like she was brought here and I was meant to look after her and I feel that she is looking after me. I feel like she was brought here because she knew I needed somebody. Elley is now looking to the future and has secured a place to study counselling at college in September. She hopes that by being so honest about her struggles will make other people realise they\u0027re also “allowed” to feel sad when bad things happen.

The young royal, who is ninth in line to the throne, joined Instagram in March and has been delighting fans with her photos ever since. She\u0027s posted pictures of her charity events as well as personal snaps of her with the family and her fianc\u0026eacute Jack Brooksbank. But many people were a tad surprised when she popped up as a suggested friend, because the royal family are known for being incredibly strict when it comes to their private life. Most of her family aren\u0027t allowed social media accounts, and Meghan Markle had to close all of her pages down when she started dating Prince Harry.   But Eugenie isn\u0027t technically a working royal, which means she\u0027s allowed an account, reports Hello magazine .  Even though she\u0027s a member of the royal family, she doesn\u0027t spend her days attends official engagements like William, Kate and Harry. She actually has a normal job, and works at Hauser \u0026amp Wirth, a contemporary art gallery in London. However she does do a lot of charity work, and she\u0027s shared several photos from events.  She\u0027s also shared personal family photos with funny captions, including a picture of Jack with the message: Clearly I said something funny this time! Sums up Jack in a nutshell! Her blue-ticked account has more than 173,000 followers, even though she only follows 18 people.  The lucky people on her list include her parents, the official royal accounts, several charities and her pal popstar Ellie Goulding. Her official bio reads The Official Instagram Account for Princess Eugenie with a link back to her official website.

So it\u0027s no surprise that the Queen is on the lookout for a small army of maids to help her live her best, most majestic life.  In fact, for the SECOND time in less than three months, she\u0027s trying maids with an eye for detail to clean and care for her palaces in London and Windsor Castle. Sound tempting?

Pretty Frances Watkins, 15, beat dozens of able-bodied competitors to land the top prize and make history. She was diagnosed with cerebral palsy, which affects movement and co-ordination, after being born 10 weeks premature. Despite needing a wheelchair to get around, Frances was determined to enter the beauty pageant. She pulled on her ballgown and put on make-up to take the stage at Teen Natural Beauty Wales and win the event. Her proud mum Marie Watkins, 42, described Frances\u0027 victory as “inspirational”.  She said: “I’ve always told Frances there is no such word as can\u0027t.

Joe Cairnie, 31, was found dead in a hotel room in Bangkok, Thailand, on Sunday after worried friends raised the alarm when they were unable to contact him. His shocked family are now planning to bring him home so he can be buried next to his sister Suzanne, who was just 15 when she was mown down by a car moments after stepping off a bus in Glasgow in 2006. In a heartbreaking tribute, his sister Michelle said: “I never ever wanted to feel loss like this ever again. And their dad said: “You just never think lightning will strike twice in one family, but it has.”  John, 50, from Milngavie, near Glasgow, spoke to the Daily Record yesterday of his agony at losing a second child. He said: “We are still coming to terms with losing Suzanne, and now Joe is gone too. “I just can’t believe what has happened – and what makes it worse is that we don’t know the details surrounding Joe’s death. “We’ve been told we will have to wait on the results of a postmortem, and that will take four to five days. “We had no idea anything was wrong until two police officers arrived at my door on Monday and told me Joe was gone. “I’m speaking with the consulate and just want to know what happened to my son. “We don’t know if he was unwell, if his drink was spiked or if something else happened. “It could be anything, we just don’t know. We’re numb.  John spoke to his son on Friday, just moments before he boarded a flight from Heathrow to Bangkok. Joe, who worked for Glasgow City Council before moving to Cambridge two years ago, was meeting friends during the 10-day trip. John said: “It was his first holiday in years and he was looking forward to it. “He was rushing to catch his flight when I spoke to him. I told him to enjoy the experience and be safe. “I never thought it would be our last conversation. “He was a great lad and the life and soul of our family. “Although he moved down south, he would come up and visit a lot. He was working hard and had his whole life ahead of him. “It’s just so tragic that he’s gone. “We just want him back home because he’s so far away. “Joe will be buried next to his sister Suzanne at Langfaulds Cemetery. “All of the family are in bits, it’s just so hard to accept.”  Joe didn’t have travel insurance and a JustGiving page has been set up by his friend Oliver Mcdonald to help the family with the cost of repatriating the body. By last night, more than \u0026pound9500 had been raised and John said the family were overwhelmed by the kind donations. He added: “Joe was a popular boy and had so many friends. “It was typical of him to go abroad with no insurance. He was happy-go-lucky and never thought anything would happen to him. “He was important to a lot of people and after hearing of his death a close friend set up the page. “We just want to do all we can to bring Joe home. It will cost thousands and we’ll also have to arrange the funeral.” Mum Jayne Bates, who is divorced from Joe’s dad, posted on social media: “Cant believe this… Want too wake up and its all been a nightmare. Broken is a word. I’m nothing without you son. I love you with all my heart. “Wish I could swap places with you. Oh joe your my world without you in it. I cant see a life. Please this can’t be real.

Why has this happened? “I love and miss you Joe so much. I just want you home so I can give you a big cuddle. “I really wish this wasn’t true. I am absolutely heartbroken. “I never ever wanted to feel loss like this ever again after Suzanne and now it’s happened again. “I am crying myself to sleep tonight – that’s if I can sleep. “We will bring you home Joe, don’t you worry, and we will give you a huge send-off.

The 17-year-old pupil\u0027s sister said male security officers demanded she remove her bra after the garment\u0027s underwire repeatedly set off the security alarm. After removing her bra, the unnamed Russian student, was reportedly ordered to walk through a metal detector wearing just her see-through shirt as security men allegedly \u0027focused on her bust\u0027. The girl’s sister posted a complaint about the incident which occurred at School #10 in the city of Nizhnekamsk. Russia has stepped up school security ahead of the so-called Final State Exam for school-leavers and also after a succession of violent knife attacks in classrooms.  The armed security officers are invariably male. The girl\u0027s sister wrote: “Girls were this year made not only to give away their mobile phones but also to take off their underwear. “The guards held back my sister, forced her to take off her bra and to walk in her transparent chiffon blouse over her naked body through the metal detector frame in front of two men who were focused on her bust. “What could she write after this in her exam? “She was in hysterics. She was not permitted to delay the exam.  “Doctors were called twice….she was not allowed to call her parents.” The alleged incident was at School Number Ten in the city, in oil-rich Tatarstan. The girl’s mother has made a formal complaint about the incident and an investigation is underway. Local education official Ayziryak Ramazamova said: “The underwire in the bra kept beeping.” But contradicting witnesses denied the girl had been forced to remove her bra. Teacher Eduard Taymasov said students and their parents were routinely told not to send their children to school with any metal on their clothing.  He said such checks were common at Russian schools. He said: Teachers warn students to wear clothes without any metal hooks, buttons or chains, and it’s the same about bras. “Many children just do not bother. “At every meeting the clothes are discussed a hundred times… “They don’t take off their bras in front of others, there is a special room where they do it. “Usually it is checked and they go.” One mother posted: “My friend has called me in a state of shock, she said that her daughter was forced to take off her bra.  “How could it happen? “Tell us please what shall we do? “Where to complain? These exams are such a stress for all students, and now they make them cry and undress….” A former student called Polina Kulikovksaya said she had previously suffered the same fate. Polina said: “We were told to take our bras off in a separate room, then walk in front of other (students) in our shirts though the security. “Thank God mine was not transparent.” Another mother said: “My daughter has sat the exam too - it was freezing at school and they had to stay there for four hours.

Mobile phone footage has captured terrifying scenes in which children in school uniform dice with death on the N1 motorway in South Africa\u0027s Western Cape province. The video footage shows two boys running head on into oncoming traffic before jumping out of harm\u0027s way at the last second as huge lorries rush past. Another scene sees two more boys running towards a lorry when one boy stops to tie his shoelace.  He sees the lorry and manages to dodge it just seconds before it hurtles past. The game dictates that the first person to swerve out of the way of incoming traffic is the \u0027chicken\u0027 and the person who stays in the road for the longest is the winner. In the video, one child can be heard screaming in terror while another is heard laughing as the two players jump out of the way just in time. However for the South African Long-Distance Truckers group the game is no laughing matter.

also giving back to the community.So, she began helping out the Verdant Works museum and eight years later is still giving up her time to help visitors to the historic mill.\u0026#8220I was retired so I was looking for something that I was interested in, and I\u0026#8217ve always been interested in industrial history so I just came along and had a shot at it,\u0026#8221 she said.\u0026#8220I\u0026#8217m meeting loads of people from all over the world, it\u0026#8217s a good place.\u0026#8221Pat said her interest in history came from her time as a teacher, when it was one of the subjects she taught, and said the museum gave her a chance to continue learning about it.\u0026#8220The 19th century industry industrial revolution was quite interesting,\u0026#8221 she said.\u0026#8220Sometimes you learn from visitors because they\u0026#8217ll say something and you\u0026#8217ll go \u0026#8216oh I never thought about that\u0026#8217 and you\u0026#8217ll go and look it up.\u0026#8221Pat, who now lives in Lawside, is originally from Elie in Fife before attending university in Dundee.She had taught at a number of schools in the area, including St Johns, Linlathen and Morgan Academy.As well as volunteering at the mill, she was also kept busy with other things such as brushing up on her German.\u0026#8220When I was at university, friends and I decided to go hitchhiking in Germany and even then it wasn\u0026#8217t safe,\u0026#8221 she said.\u0026#8220I started to teach myself German and then I went to teach in Germany, teaching English in a German school.\u0026#8220I hadn\u0026#8217t done it in school so I never had the basics of the grammar, so that\u0026#8217s what I\u0026#8217m trying to do now.\u0026#8221She said volunteering was a great thing to do.\u0026#8220When you\u0026#8217re retired you have to look for things to do,\u0026#8221 she said.\u0026#8220Most of the volunteers here are retired, though not all of them\u0026#8220There\u0026#8217s definitely a benefit from doing it, because it\u0026#8217s nice interacting with people and helping them, and when people thank you for that it\u0026#8217s nice as well.\u0026#8220Doing something volunteering, you\u0026#8217re giving something

best surfaces in the country","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United are investing over £20,000 this summer to make sure they have the best playing surface in the Championship.Since manager Csaba Laszlo was appointed in November, he’s stressed the need for a pristine pitch to match the passing style he wants from the Tangerines.And while last season the surface was the envy of most of their second-tier rivals, the board have stumped up five figures to make sure it’s even better next term and beyond.They announced this week the existing turf has been lifted and a process known as vertical sand-banding started.While that’s a complicated, as well as expensive, process, the new and improved pitch will be ready when the first of the Betfred Cup group matches kick off there in as little as six weeks.The work being carried out will also improve drainage – something that has been a problem, particularly in the area near the tunnel at the Eddie Thompson Stand end of Tannadice.And, while most of the budget for the next 12 months is going on putting together a squad capable of winning promotion, chairman Mike Martin is viewing the pitch project as a sound investment.“We are investing in our on and off-field operations in a structured way with every aspect of our work designed to deliver improvement throughout the club,” he said.“In this case, we aim to make sure that Tannadice continues to be one of the best surfaces in the country for playing professional football.”Those Betfred Cup fixtures are expected to be confirmed next week with league fixtures out on June 14.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b165a6106f22.jpg ","title":"dundee united step up keeper search as mehmet begins recovery from knee

Danny Rogers to help fill the gaps in their last line of defence.With Deniz Mehmet out long term and Harry Lewis back at Southampton, the Tangerines are on the hunt for two first-team goalies.And 24-year-old Rogers is one name on their list of possible additions.New York born and an American citizen, Rogers was capped nine times at U/21 level for the Republic of Ireland, for whom he qualifies through his Irish mother.He’s only played a handful of games for the Dons in six years at Pittodrie, but has over 100 top-team appearances under his belt during loan spells at Airdrie, Dumbarton and Falkirk.Most of those games came during a two-year spell with Falkirk between 2015 and 2017.He recently signed a two-year contract extension but could be available on loan again.Deniz, meanwhile, is now likely to have the operation to repair knee ligament damage next week.It was scheduled for early last week but the surgeon in England decided to delay it because the joint he damaged against Dunfermline in the play-offs last month remained swollen.He’s likely to be out until around the turn of the year.The Tangerines, meanwhile, have confirmed the signing of young Celtic defender Sam Wardrop and it’s understood Dunfermline’s Fraser Aird will be revealed as another member of the squad over the next few days.A deal for Wardrop was agreed with the Hoops last week and the 20-year-old joins on a two-year contract.The right-back has represented Scotland at U/15, U/16, U/17 and U/19 levels and captained Celtic’s Youth team to Scottish Cup victory in 2016.“Sam is an athletic and

I remember there were discussions in recent years to reduce the number of gulls.“Judging by these images I can’t see any justification that any such steps have been taken to cull the gulls or remove eggs from nests.“You just need to look at the roof next to the casino and the gym you can see hundreds of them at any time.”Lynne Short, city development convener, said: “I will be in contact with the refuse teams to survey the bins as it appears the current provisions aren’t adequate enough.”A Dundee City Council spokeswoman said: “Bins have been provided in many areas where, previously, waste bags were placed on the footpaths and became magnets for gulls.“Pest control officers are involved in removing eggs and nests throughout breeding season, and while this greatly reduces incidences of aggressive behaviour and disrupts and reduces the breeding pattern, it can take between five and seven years to take hold.“Gulls are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.“It allows for the destruction of birds under certain circumstances, but this is only permissible where it can be demonstrated that they pose a risk to public safety or public health, and only when all other non-lethal methods of control have been discounted.“We would also ask that people do not feed gulls as this only exacerbates the problem.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"promising signs as csaba laszlo begins to create new dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe summer of change at Tannadice has only just begun but the new-look Dundee United side is starting to take shape – what kind of shape are they in exactly, though?So far, the Tangerines have decimated last season’s pool with almost a full matchday squad list heading out the door.That left them with a skeleton squad before their business really got started last week.Five faces are in the door with the few players manager Csaba Laszlo wanted to keep given new contracts.More will be coming in during the next few weeks but, right now, how are they shaping up?GoalkeeperDeniz Mehmet looked certain to be the man between the sticks this season but for his knee injury picked up at the end of last season.With Harry Lewis heading back to Southampton after his loan, highly-rated youth keeper Josh Donaldson is the only fit goalie at the club.Verdict: A goalkeeper is certainly on the shopping list.DefenceTwo defenders have been brought in already this summer in Sam Wardrop and Callum Booth.Booth is expected to be first choice at left-back ahead of Jamie Robson while Wardrop will battle it out with Stewart Murdoch on the right.Though Murdoch has slotted in at centre-half, there is a big gap to be filled in that position.William Edjenguele, Tam Scobbie and Lewis Toshney are still around but Csaba and head scout Paul Sturrock are certainly looking for two starting centre-backs.Verdict: Big gap to fill in the middle but full-back positions look solid.MidfieldFit and healthy, Dundee United’s central midfield places are pretty much sewn up.Fraser Fyvie and Sam Stanton are the club’s stand-out talents at the moment and will occupy the middle of the park without doubt when available.In reserve is Scott Allardice after he signed a new one-year deal.Out wide, Fraser Aird has been brought in to play on the left side while Billy King is likely to start on the right.Paul McMullan hasn’t always been Csaba’s cup of tea but showed at the start of last season how effective he can be from the wings while youngster Matty Smith has slotted in out wide at times, though is nominally a striker.Verdict: Centre is strong when fit but numbers needed for a long season.AttackThe biggest capture so far by the Tangerines has been striker Nicky Clark coming from Dunfermline on a free transfer.The former Queen of the South and Rangers man has scored 29 goals in his last 62 matches in the Championship and is tasked with being Csaba’s main goal threat.Also in is former Ross County striker Craig Curran.The battling forward has never been prolific but his job will be to provide ammunition for Clark, while knocking in a few himself.James Keatings, too, is still around at Tannadice after a season beset by injury and personal problems. He’ll seem like a new signing if he can rediscover the form that helped Hamilton, Hearts and Hibs gain promotion to the top flight.Verdict: Looking good up top.Overall: With just 18 first-team players on the books, work is obviously still to be done but initial signs look promising. Adding solid defenders, however, is vital.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1659e451e1b.jpg ","title":"this is colin the dundee wheelchair whizz who fitted chihuahua bruce with life saving wheels","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHe’s the man who gave a poorly pup a new leash of life.And now Colin Anderson’s almighty creation for Bruce the bionic chihuahua has attracted the interest of hundreds of fellow designers.By day, the 51-year-old helps transform people’s lives – working as a wheelchair technician at Ninewells Hospital.But recently, he was asked if he could use his invention skills to help create a wheelchair for Bruce by a family member who had read about his condition.The Tele previously told how Lochee woman Robyn Boyd and her family helped save the puppy at 10 weeks old with vets recommending he be put down because he required constant care.We then told how Colin had stepped in to help Bruce with his new wheels, which will help the dog build up his strength again.Colin said: “I was contacted and asked if I could design something for Bruce and I definitely enjoy a challenge. I modified a design someone had uploaded to the internet as I thought it was just about perfect for him.“All I had to do was personalise it for the size of Bruce after I measured him, I then used a programme to design a buggy for his body with the correct width of the arc for the front wheels so as not to interfere with his poorly legs.“I get a lot of pleasure from being able to help people with anything they may need designed from a new door nameplate to the wheels for Bruce, you imagine it and I will try to build it, you are only limited by your imagination.“I did see a big difference when I saw him after a week and I think we are just about there.”In addition to both of his front legs being dislocated, Bruce also has underdeveloped joints and non- cancerous tumours in his eyes as well as having stunted growth.He has received daily massages and hydrotherapy treatment – sometimes up to three times a day – in a bid to increase his strength.Bruce was so small on arriving at their home that he could fit into the palm of Robyn’s hand.His wheels – complete with his very own nameplate – were created through a 3D printer with the design meaning Robyn and mum Jayne Kelly can have it adjusted should Bruce grow out of it.Robyn, Jayne and other family members have been out to meet Colin several times so Bruce could test out the prototype.This was the first time that Colin, of Polepark, had designed a prototype for an animal.His creation is now available on free design-sharing website Thingverse, with hundreds of people showing an interest in adapting his work.Colin said: “I’m normally used to working with humans and altering wheelchairs, which I’ve done for about 20 years.“This was the first time I’ve done anything for animals and it’s something I would happily do again if the opportunity came up. It took a couple of trials to get it almost perfect and after a couple of weeks I found a third wheel at the back to stabilise him was ideal.“The advantage of 3D printing is that if he does grow any more it is easy to change the size and print a replacement and the current model is configurable so I can adjust the height later.“I’ve spent about four to five years working with 3D printing and I’ve definitely seen a big difference in the quality of the designs that I’ve been able to come up with.“I’m just glad I was able to help Bruce improve and it’s been quite pleasing to see the reaction that I’ve had to the design.“It means that people can now go and adapt it however they like and to suit whatever situation.“Hopefully that will go some way to making a difference.”VIDEO: Adorable pup Bruce shows off his custom made wheels after being saved by Dundee family\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Drastic weight loss mum-of-four    too fat to have bingo wings clipped    by Scots medics","story":"                          A woman who was once obese has been rejected for cosmetic surgery to remove excess skin -

We\u0026rsquove got the most roads and schools and most of them in the poorest condition.

Scottish transfer window opens on Saturday.Aberdeen did not reveal the fee, but it is thought they\u0026#8217ve paid around £200,000 for the player.Republic of Ireland squad player Forrester is Dons’

signing Chris Forrester today vowed to be an influential goal-scoring playmaker – starting in Europe.The midfielder became Dons boss Derek McInnes’ first major signing of the summer when signing a three-year contract from Peterborough United.Rated as a multi-million star by Peterborough only 18 months ago, the Dons secured the 25-year-old for a fee understood to be £200,0000.Former Posh captain Forrester had a year left on his contract at Peterborough but was slapped on the transfer list at the end of the season by Steve Evans.The midfielder is a former Republic of Ireland U21 cap and broke into the senior squad in 2016 but has still to be capped.Dons boss Derek McInnes’ main priority in the transfer window was to replace the void left by the exit of Kenny McLean.Scotland cap McLean was the Reds’ main midfield playmaker but has left Pittodrie for Championship side Norwich City.Forrester insists he can bring that creative spark McInnes is searching for and aims to hit the ground running in the Europa League.He said: “I am not afraid to get on the ball as that is what I love to do.“I love to get the game going and passing to the lads that can maybe score the goals.“This season I want to be the one receiving the ball, doing something with it and also scoring a few goals.“In the last two seasons at Peterborough I forgot how to find the goal.“Coming up here one of my main aims is to get back in amongst the goals.“I aim to be a goal scoring midfielder as opposed to someone just sitting in the middle and passing the ball.“I want to see myself up there pressing the ball and creating the assists or creating the goal that wins the game.”Aberdeen had also made an enquiry about Forrester’s Peterborough team-mate Jack Baldwin.However, the Reds cooled their interest in the defender.Forrester revealed boss McInnes was pivotal in persuading him to move to Pittodrie.He said: “He (McInnes) said he sees me as an important player for the team which is music to my ears.“He said he sees me coming into the team and being the main passer which is what I liked to hear.“That helped to bring me here.”Aberdeen enter the Europa League at the second qualifying round stage on July 26.Despite playing in England’s third tier, Forrester has no concerns about making his Dons debut on the continental stage.He played in Europe for both Bohemians and St Patrick’s Athletic from the League of Ireland.He said: “My first European trip was with Bohemians when I was 18 and we went to Slovenia to play Ljubljana (Olimpija).“That was a massive experience for me and I did that every year I was in the League of Ireland.“For about five years I went on European trips and had some great results.“We (St Patrick’s Athletic) knocked out Siroki Brijeg (of Bosnia, 3-2 aggregate in 2012).“We also played Legia Warsaw which was a massive game in front of a massive crowd.“We were 1-0 up until the scored an equalizer in the 89th minute (1-1 first leg, 5-0 second for 6-1 aggregate loss).“I have plenty of experience in Europe and hopefully can bring that to the team this season.”Forrester was so highly rated Peterborough club chairman valued him as a multi-million pound player in January 2016.However, after a frustrating season he was transfer listed this summer with a year left on his Posh deal.Forrester said: “As soon as my agent told me about the interest from Aberdeen I knew that I needed a fresh start from Peterborough.“Things didn’t go so well last season.“I could see Aberdeen get over 15,000 at games most weeks and it is a club with stature.“I am looking forward

It’s has been a very, very fast process here.\u0026#8220It’s one of the advantages of the technology we’ve used. I can’t see anything else being quicker.”Vattenfall installation manager Alistair Leighton agrees: “One installation only took two hours and forty minutes and we’ve got vessels that can lay the field very quickly.Aberdeen Offshore Wind Farm has embraced all sorts of new technology and some of that was really familiar to people who traditionally work in oil and gas.“There’s so much scope for skills to be transferred from oil and gas to renewable energy in the north-east.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"plans to open new brewdog coffee shop in north east town deferred","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCouncillors have deferred plans to open a new coffee shop in a north-east town.Brewdog submitted the plans to Aberdeenshire Council to open a branch of the Coffee Apothecary at The Square in Ellon.The plans have been lodged for the former Helping Hands store in the town.The Coffee Apothecary, which has a branch in Udny, would move into the site after agreeing a deal with the beer giants.Officials at Aberdeenshire Council had recommended the proposals for approval but councillors have deferred the application until a site visit is carried out.Ward councillor Richard Thomson said: “There was a number of concerns about the waste disposal arrangements so we have deferred for a site visit just to look at that.”A date for the site visit is yet to be arranged but is expected to take place within three weeks.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 24","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 17/05/18, 11:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.We heartily agree with the decision of the Lord Lieutenant to nominate Betty Rhodick to attend the royal wedding.As far as we are aware, no one works harder for Lochgilphead  \u0026#8211 and once Betty puts her mind to something\u0026#8230Betty and Geordie have been the figureheads for the Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day commemorations since they started, but she deserves this recognition not just for this one annual event, but for all she does on our behalf.Enjoy yourself, Betty and Kelly.The renovated Kilmartin Museum is now almost within reach.This is sure to be of great economic benefit to the region when it opens in two years and it is an exciting prospect that will enable the unique heritage of Mid Argyll to be properly showcased.Just what was last weekend\u0026#8217s Scapa festival at Ardkinglas?The answer is probably unique to every individual who attended.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp.

He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

Entitled ‘Looking for Noah’ they stand, incongruously with a licence plate wedged in antlers.The walk takes the visitor past thought-provoking sculptures, including Lesley Burr’s beautifully-painted birdcages that could house fairies, to an opening at The Mill with its own maze and poetry carved into rock.The Artmap Argyll group brings together artists of different specialities to make for an intrigung walk through the woods.A highlight for many will be Melanie Chimelewska’s limestone seal pup, lying gleefully on the shore, but Andy McClintock’s dancing mermaids undoubtedly captured a feeling of eerie magic, as though having stepped into a Grimm brothers\u0026#8217 fairytale. The wire and cloth faceless mermaids dance on the surface of a pond but hide, too, under a running waterfall, washing the seaweed stuck to their scaled tails.Andy McClintock said: ‘I imagine water sprites dancing in the lagoon and disporting themselves in waterfalls.’Within The Mill itself, paintings are hung showing the allure of algae.Artist Lottie Goodlet said: ‘As a snorkeller and swimmer in the Sound of Jura, I am fascinated by seaweed beneath me.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead kids get kitted out","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/05/18, 5:11 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowLochgilphead Soccer Centre is delighted to have taken delivery of a quality rain jacket for each of the kids associated with the centre and Red Star YFC.That’s 120 rain jackets in total.As well as making sure the kids look smart and feel part of the club they will also help keep them dry and warm when the weather is a bit wet and windy.The rain jackets have been sponsored by Mid Argyll Youth Development Services (MAYDS) and the Soccer Centre would like to say a huge thank you to MAYDS for this sponsorship and ongoing support.Five teams from Lochgilphead travelled to the Oban Football Festival on a Saturday April 28.

The council believes this will make the process faster and easier for people thinking about building their own home.A community information and feedback event will be held on Wednesday June 6 at Lochgilphead Community Centre from 1pm to 6.30pm, with presentations scheduled for 2pm and 5.30pm.Anyone interested in the Simplified Planning Zones is invited to attend and will be able to ask questions, get involved in shaping the design and find out much more about each of the proposed sites.

The Simmentals are hot on their heels with 103 entries, a 10-year record  and an increase from 85 in 2017. And the Charolais are also seeing a resurgence, with a jump to 76, from 61 last year.The numbers in the dairy section total 109 entries, with the largest class being the Ayrshire with 38, up from 29 in 2017. Holsteins total 29 entries, and the Dairy Shorthorn class has seen numbers more than double from 12 to 25. This year\u0026#8217s Queen\u0026#8217s Cup will be in the dairy class.Sheep entries once again command the Royal Highland Show with 2,029 animals making this the second largest number of entries in more than a decade.Leading the way is the Texel section with 182 entries, with the Beltex close behind with 177. Elsewhere in the sheep classes, the Suffolks have their highest number in 10 years with 110 entries (90 in 2017). The Ryelands and the Rouges also see record numbers for the last decade, with 82 and 39 entries respectively (up from 65 and 34 in 2017). Commercial sheep entries are also seeing increased interest with 104 entries, up from 85 in 2017.  The North of England Mule class was introduced to the Show in 2011 and sees its highest ever entries, with 69 in the class.The Young Handler competition has 56 entries, illustrating the continued interest from the next generation particularly in this the Year of Young People.An exciting development is the interest in the goat classes with a ten-year high of 39 entries and the Boer breed, increasing from 16 to 27.  Six goat young handlers will also compete for the title.1,665 entries have been received in the light horse section, with the HOYS qualifying Mountain and Moorland Under Saddle section again dominating with 197 entries, up from 192 in 2017.The Heavy Horse section continues to have a strong presence, with 392 entries. Highland females lead the way with 94, with Shetland females closely behind with 84.In 2009 the show separated the Welsh C and Welsh D classes due to increasing demand, and that has proved to be winning formula with record entries again this year, with 43 and 59 respectively.Royal Highland Show Manager David Jackson, said: \u0026#8216The Highland continues to be the leading event for showcasing the very best the livestock industry has to offer, and it extremely rewarding that the industry continues to recognise its importance as a platform for the sector.\u0026#8216We continue to see very strong entries, with increasing numbers in many sections, especially in the commercial classes, and I know we will see some fierce competition for a winning place.\u0026#8216As an event, we grow year on year and attract new audiences as we widen the appeal for visitors from town and country. Yet we remain true to our roots as an agricultural show and work hard to be truly relevant to all aspects of farming and rural life.\u0026#8216The Grand Parade always proves to be a high point of the show and gives us a chance to celebrate the commitment and dedication of all our cattle and heavy horse exhibitors. I recommend everyone to make time to observe this truly spectacular display.\u0026#8216The team look forward to welcoming all our exhibitors, from the Scottish islands to South West England to Northern Ireland. They are dedicated to their craft, and I am extremely grateful for their continued support and wish them all the best of luck.\u0026#8217Supported by Royal Bank of Scotland, the 178th Royal Highland Show will take place at the Royal Highland Centre, Ingliston, Edinburgh, on June 21-24.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 26","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 02/06/18, 3:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.What a spell of weather we have had over the past week and more.Knowing the Argyll climate, by the time you read this you might be sitting in a blizzard in front of the fire enjoying your paper but it was good while it lasted.Welcome as it is, warm weather brings its own problems.

Children from Ballantrae Primary are set to relocate to Girvan Primary following a major fire at the village school yesterday evening. It is believed that around 30 firefighters were called to the blaze at 8.38pm on Monday.  The fire – contained within the main school building – caused extensive damage to the existing classroom and early years provision at the school. A new extension, which is currently under construction, was unaffected. Fifty-eight P1-P7 children are expected to make the move to Girvan Primary from Thursday, June 7, once suitable arrangements are in place to transport pupils and staff.  Plans are also underway to relocate the 13 early years children to Ballantrae Community Centre, keeping them within the local community. The intention is to introduce the changes for the early years centre from Monday, June 11 however, this will be subject to finalising arrangements with both Ballantrae Community Association and the Care Inspectorate, who will need to register the centre before it can be used. A drop-in session will be held at Ballantrae Community Centre between 4pm-6pm tomorrow (Wednesday) to update parents/carers and to give them the opportunity to ask any questions they may have. Councillor William Grant, South Ayrshire Council’s Portfolio Holder for Lifelong Learning, said: “This is a really sad end to the school year at Ballantrae Primary and I know it will have affected everyone in this tight-knit community. “I’m pleased we have been able to move so quickly to put alternative arrangements in place for children and staff, keeping the loss of education time to an absolute minimum, which is a positive outcome.  “And my thanks to everyone involved in achieving this, especially colleagues at Girvan Primary and Ballantrae Community Centre. “At this time it’s too early for us to have a clear picture of the extent of the damage to the school building and the work that will be involved to bring it back into use. “However, there’s no doubt interim education arrangements will need to run well into the new school year and it could be many months before pupils can return. “Our priority will be to maintain quality learning and teaching for our children during this time and that’s what we will focus on.” Ballantrae Primary’s Head Teacher, Yvonne Templeton, added: “We’re all devastated by what’s happened and really can’t believe it. “Our school is very much at the heart of the community in Ballantrae and I know this will have an impact on everyone not just within the school, but right across our village. “However, we can all be grateful that no one was hurt in the fire. “My focus will be on supporting our children, staff, parents and carers while we’re decanted from the school we know and love, but I know we’ll take the spirit and ethos of Ballantrae Primary wherever we are.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12651122.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_310518bella_03JPG.jpg","title":"bella mani boss claims beauty","story":"NewsBella Mani boss claims beauty empire is safe despite tax collectors swooping inBella Mani - Italian for beautiful hands - has operations in Ayr and Prestwick.

Bella Mani - Italian for beautiful hands - has operations in Ayr and Prestwick. But the large salon in Irvine’s Rivergate mall has been shut. However boss Nigel Howard,47, of Alloway, insists the workforce is safe despite a formal winding up notice. He’s a former Ayr United centre half star who played more than 50 games for the club between 1991 and 94. A petition lodged at Ayr Sheriff Court on behalf of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs wants Bella Mani Salons (Ayr \u0026amp Irvine) Ltd wound up by the court. They also want a liquidator put in place and any parties claiming an interest in the action must get it touch by this Thursday. There are eight branches , some run by differently named companies. Bella Mani Salons (Ayr and Irvine) was launched five years ago with a registered address at the Prestwick Main Street Salon. Bella Mani Salons (Prestwick) has Gabriella Howard as the sole director. The firm has been a salon of the year at the Scottish Hair and Beauty Awards and INAA make-up artisit of the year.  Bella Mani Salons (Kilmarnock) was dissolved last June and Bella Mani Salons (Motherwell) went the same way ten weeks ago. Both these firms had a registered address at the Howard home in Alloway. Nigel is listed as the sole active director of the Ayr\u0026ampIrvine firm, his wife Victoria resigned as a director in 2013, just nine months after the company was incorporated. But on Monday Nigel would not say how much tax HMRC is looking for and that it was “complicated and being contested.” He said: “Staff have been worried but I have assured them everything is fine. This is a dormant company that does not affect day to day running. The Irvine salon is shut and we are moving to a smaller one in the High Street. “I think this is a positive story and we work very hard to keep a total of 64 staff in jobs.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"drive through coffee shop petrol","story":"NewsDrive-through coffee shop and petrol pumps could be built on busy main roadThe ‘Highway Services’ would be located at Bogend Toll near Symington and could create 30 jobs.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley14:45, 6 JUN 2018NewsA77 near Dutch House Roundabout (Image: Alister Firth/Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA drive-through coffee shop and petrol pumps are to be built on the A77 if plans get the green light. The ‘Highway Services’ would be located at Bogend Toll near Symington and could create 30 jobs. A Shell petrol station and Londis shop are part of the vision for the site. A raft of documents have been lodged with South Ayrshire Council as part of a planning application. London-based Grove Garages is behind the proposal, which would see two buildings erected.   The company has an agreement with Shell and Londis but is still in talks to sign-up a coffee firm.  The plan includes eight fuel pumps, 11 parking spaces, two car wash bays and pumps for HGVs.  The coffee shop would have a floor space of 260sqm with 29 car spaces and a drive through at the back. A supporting statement said: “The location of the site represents an ideal opportunity for a roadside servies area to cater for the frequent tourist, haulage and commuter traffic using the A77. It said the development would ensure the “reuse of a visually and environmentally poor site in a prominent location alongside one of Scotland’s main tourist routes, the A77.”  The site used to be a field belonging to Dyke Farm. Access to the site would be from the B730 adjoining the A77 north bound carriageway. Cars could enter from the southbound carriageway through the existing flyover. Chargers would also be available for electric cars. A design and access statement said: “The proposals give back purpose to an unused site, which has potential to provide an important service to the local area and indeed the wider area. The design proposals are considered to be respectful to the local environment and are in line with local policy and guidelines. No decision has been made on the application yet.

The Gym Group, which runs more than 120 outlets across the UK, is scheduled to open a 15,000sq ft unit in the early part of 2019. It comes just a week after fellow new investors, Wren Kitchens, announced their intention to take up residence in the park later this year. Heathfield, a 190,000sq ft park, is to lose more than a third of its live trading space in the coming months as names such as Homebase, Carpetright and Maplin bow out. But Alistair Dickie, of the park’s development firm Ediston Properties, insists the quick capture of new tenants has proved there remains plenty of potential for the future. He said: “We are losing something like 72,000sq ft of trading space owing to retailer failures and consolidation in the marketplace. “It goes without saying that is a lot to deal with, but our park – and Ayr as a destination in general – is very resilient. “Interest in the site from new names has not slowed and the acquisition of both Wren and the Gym Group is testament to that. “Since we acquired the park, we have carried out 11 new lettings and the arrival of Wren and the Gym Group takes that to 13. “That proves we are continuing to move in the right direction and our faith in the park remains as strong as ever.”  Ediston, who bought Heathfield in 2011 in a deal worth \u0026pound31.8 million, have attracted big names like M\u0026ampS, Costa and DFS to the site in the intervening years. And Mr Dickie says further investment is to follow as the park looks to rally from this year’s trading setbacks. He added: “We have plans in place to spend a further \u0026pound2 million in September of this year “And moving forward, we have a strong business plan to ensure the prosperity of the park and its future. “I fully believe we are now through the worst of what has been a turbulent spell.” The Gym Group, founded in 2008 by former English squash player John Treharne, operates one other Ayrshire branch in Kilmarnock. It follows a \u0026pound500,000 investment when it took over a Lifestyle Fitness outlet at the Queen’s Drive retail park.

The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision. It is a big, big signing which shows our intent and now we need the fans to respond with an upsurge in season ticket sales.

The couple now live in Kilmarnock. “We actually met about 15 years ago when both of us used to go ice skating at the Magnum on a Friday night,” said Kim. The pair lost touch over the years but were reunited six years ago. Kim said: “We started chatting as friends but it became apparent the spark was definitely still there between us and a few months later we moved in together. “It was a whirlwind romance - within a year of meeting we had moved in together, got engaged and had a beautiful baby boy.  “We then had another baby in 2016 and it was then we decided to start planning the wedding.” The couple tied the knot at The Vu in Bathgate on Mother’s Day, March 11 this year. Kim said: “We were a bit panicky about the weather as the week before the wedding was storm Edna and everyone was snowed in. “There was still some snow lying around on the wedding day but the sun was shining. “The wedding day was an emotional day from start to finish it was full of tears and laughter and genuinely was the best day of our lives!” The bride wore a Maggie Sottero ‘Lisette’ dress from Opus Couture in West Kilbride, as well as veil and hair piece. The kilts were from MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick.  The couple’s wedding party consisted of flowergirls - Daughters, Macie O’Donnell and Evie McLauchlan and bride’s sister Molly Miller Page boys were son, Alfie McLauchlan and bride’s brother Jack Miller and the best man was Groom’s brother-in-law, Richard Hunter. Kim continued: “We haven’t managed to get away on a honeymoon yet as we have three children so picking a destination has been quite difficult! “We do plan on going somewhere we just haven’t decided where yet.” KSG Photography captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with beautiful photos to look back on. Claire’s Crystal Brides arranged the bouquets with Ashley Nimmo and Jett Patterson of Allure Hair \u0026amp Beauty, Kilmarnock created the hair and beauty looks for the day. Kim added: “Our cake was made by a friend who is a cake maker, Diane Kay. “We didn’t really have a clue about a cake so we just sent Diane some pictures and trusted her to make us a gorgeous cake and we were not disappointed!  “We had a white three tier cake with silver and diamant\u0026eacute lace trim, it fitted the wedding theme perfectly and was absolutely delicious.” The couple added: “Thanks to all the staff at the Vu for an absolutely amazing day. “Kevin the photographer, Waterfront the band, Winton Weddings for our stunning decor, Susan from Opus Couture for helping me chose my stunning dress and all our friends and family who attended the wedding and made it the most perfect special day! “My best friend, Shelby McAllister for being right by my side for the full day and keeping me calm in the lead up to the wedding. “And last but not least - my Grampa Willie for walking me down the aisle and making all my dreams come true!” For more photos of this week’s Wedding of the Week, pick up your copy of the Ayrshire Post.

But the iconic pile will remain under Malaysian control, after a deal was struck to keep it in South East Asian hands. It follows a purchase of the building by “experienced hoteliers” for an undisclosed fee from countryman, Eng Huat Ung. Student flats and offices are among development plans in the pipeline, the Post has learned. Now bosses are seeking talks with South Ayrshire Council, who in March slapped a Dangerous Building Notice on the site.  Structural engineers are being lined up to tackle the hotel, which has fallen into a state of disrepair in recent years. A source close to the deal said: “You can be rest assured that the new owners are keen to redevelop this building and put it to good use as soon as possible.” Mr Ung snapped up the property in a \u0026pound750,000 deal back in 2010. But attempts to keep it afloat as a hotel quickly failed and two Dangerous Building notices have followed. Bosses at Network Rail, who run the town’s train station underneath, have also grown increasingly concerned for the impact on their platforms. We revealed how a rat infestation was among the ongoing problems uncovered.  And council chiefs warned that a “wake-up call” was needed after issuing their March order on the building. Another source linked to the buy-out added: “The hotel has been in desperate need of a new direction for many years now. “This new investment should be welcomed by all in the town of Ayr and hopefully it signals the start of a much brighter future for a grand building.” A council spokesman said: “We understand the building has been bought but at this stage we have had no official confirmation. “We’ll continue to talk to the owners to ensure the building is kept in a good state of general repair.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council bosses urged","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council bosses urged to throw Ayr United a title partyCalls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson12:11, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United title celebrations (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil bosses have been urged to throw Ayr United’s champions an official party. Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"thousands pounds pocketed council after","story":"NewsThousands of pounds pocketed by council after secret VAT grabBut they’ve been caught out by golfers incensed South Ayrshire Council has not passed on any benefit of a government zero VAT ruling on leisure.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston14:18, 6 JUN 2018NewsCouncillor Peter Convery brands move on VAT “sleekit”\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThousands of pounds is being pocketed by a council after a secret VAT grab. But they’ve been caught out by golfers incensed South Ayrshire Council has not passed on any benefit of a government zero VAT ruling on leisure. In February HMRC announced there was to be no VAT on council provided leisure activities. And that will include swimming, gym use and bowling at Northfield. But South Ayrshire Council has not let any of its customers know. If effectively means golf charges have soared 24% on last year, rather than the 2.7% the council have boasted about. It means that golfers paying the \u0026pound429 season ticket price would be expecting a \u0026pound71.50 reduction for VAT.  Tory councillor Peter Convery is blasting the move as “sleekit.” And he said: “Surely people are entitled to get some money paid back to them? “This is about principle and this is sleekit. “This is peoples’ money and should never have been included in the original ticket charge. “It is very unfortunate the council cannot see this to any great extent.” In East Ayrshire, where leisure is provided by an arm’s length trust, VAT is necessary on charges. Details of the VAT grab emerged in an email between a golfer and Councillor Brian McGinley.  The golfer, who preferred to remain anonymous, said: “I do not think the majority of season ticket holders will be enamoured to discover that a significant element of their season ticket fee is actually related to a cost that SAC no longer have to bear.” Ayr East councillor McGinley said in the email: “I have ascertained that VAT has been included within the price of a season ticket up until February 18 this year. “Following a court ruling against HMRC whereby sports services provided by local authorities are now classed as exempt for VAT purposes, VAT is no longer remitted to HMRC when income is received for season tickets etc.” A council spokesman would not explain why they had not revealed the VAT windfall, if players can expect a refund or whether is was just being used to mask a huge leap in prices.  He would only say: “We work hard to ensure our golf and leisure provision continues to offer great value for local people and visitors and this is reflected in our current charging structure. “The funding from entry fees and season tickets only makes a partial contribution to our overall operating costs – with the remainder coming directly from Council subsidy – and the 2.7% price increase on last year’s fees reflects the Consumer Price Index. “Reducing inequalities within our communities is a key commitment for the Council and we have extended the concessions available under the Access to Leisure card scheme – which includes a 15% discount for all South Ayrshire residents. The change in VAT application for Council leisure services contributes towards the costs of that important scheme, which will help improve health and wellbeing across South Ayrshire, as well as helping reduce the net deficit cost of running Council leisure services, which was almost \u0026pound11 million in 2016/17.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon church mulling over decision","story":"NewsTroon church mulling over decision to allow gay couples to marryThe congregation at St Ninian’s are having time out to pray and think before revisiting the decision.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley15:25, 5 JUN 2018NewsRev Tom Montgomery (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA church is deciding whether to allow gay couples to get married in Troon. The congregation at St Ninian’s are having time out to pray and think before revisiting the decision. The vestry have split views on whether the Bentinck Drive Episcopal Church should give same-gender couples the blessing to walk up the aisle. The Rev Canon Tom Montgomery said: “Jesus was radically inclusive.” Speaking to the Post, he said: “I believe the Lord Jesus would welcome same-gender attracted people and would want them to be happy. Jesus has unconditional love for us all. “I have worked with same-gender attracted people who have had their hearts broken because they can’t express their love openly.” He said it is about “promoting and encouraging respect of all people”. The rector asked for the views of the vestry at a dedicated meeting, where he said there was a “diversity of views” among the congregation.  He added: “At the moment we are praying through the decision of the General Synod and are continuing to seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit.  “There is a wide spectrum of opinion.”   Rev Canon Montgomery would have to get authorisation from the bishop and the Registrar General of Scotland before conducting the marriages. The Scottish Episcopal Church voted to allow same-sex marriage in the church if clergy opt in. Reverend Montgomery said some are all for it while others are reticent because of their upbringing and the Bible’s teachings.  He said: “In the Bible there is no mention in the Gospel about same-gender attraction.”  But he said same-sex relationships are mentioned in a letter of St Paul and the Old Testament’s Book of Leviticus.   But he pointed out the Bible said women who commit adultery should be stoned, which people would be horrified by.  He added: “Jesus has a bias towards the downtrodden and excluded.”  And he appealed for same-sex couples and gay people in the congregation to “stick with us”. He added: “I am aware of your hurt and disappointment, as I acknowledge mine, but it is amazing what can happen when people pray and try to see what it really feels like from another person’s perspective.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Foul-mouthed supermarket worker ordered to pay compensation to colleagues","story":"A FOUL-mouthed supermarket worker has been ordered to pay compensation to four colleagues at a local store after subjecting them to abusive and offensive remarks.\nTwenty seven year old Toyah Chetwynd also made abusive comments about them on social media.\nShe pleaded guilty to a charge of threatening or abusive behaviour at Sainsbury\u0027s in Hawick on February 6.\nProcurator fiscal Graham Fraser said that Chetwynd was on long-term sick from the store and had been having a \"difficult relationship\" with management and colleagues.\nOn the day of the offence she turned up at Sainsburys at 5.30pm saying she wanted a meeting with management.\nMr Fraser said two supervisors took her to the training room where she called one a \"fat bitch\" and the other a \"dirty little slut\" before calming down and leaving the store.\nBut he explained that at five to nine in the evening it was noticed she was outside the store with her partner and was again being abusive towards staff .\nMr Fraser said: \"She was asked what she was doing there.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached. Parts of the barn were rebuilt\ninto a new dwelling house.\nThe barn itself is not without interest being the one scene of Laird Girdwood\u0026rsquos Venison Feast to which all the residents of the Northgate were invited everyone, however, to bring his own beverage.\nIt was a resounding success\u0026mdash\u0026ldquoNever before did the rafters ring with such glee. was the reported account of the event.\nA traditional forge and a modern purpose-built engineering workshop were built as well as a \u0026lsquospec\u0026rsquo tenement of four dwellings.\nWrought iron work was much in evidence, with a large garden behind and a rustic rockery at the front of the property. It was then given the name \u0026lsquoKer Place\u0026rsquo after the fashion of the time for such businessmen of which there are several examples in Peebles.\nThe cottage (pre 1823), which is still in place, became part of the enterprise and judging by the size of the lathe bed and fire-scorched rafters some serious work went on there.\nIt also incorporated James Ker\u0026rsquos dispensary for his veterinary work. James had been a student of William Dick at his Edinburgh Veterinary College which he had established at his father\u0026rsquos forge in Clyde Street in Edinburgh where the bus station now stands.\nHe obtained his diploma to practice as a veterinary surgeon and was also made a Fellow of the Edinburgh Medical Veterinary Society for his \u0026ldquovaluable contribution to veterinary science. This may have been in connection with a product he sold commercially as \u0026lsquoKer\u0026rsquos Alterative Sheep Pill\u0026rsquo.\nIt must have been effective since it was still being sold in the 1930s by his son, John Ker. He, also a blacksmith, had qualified as a veterinary surgeon nearly forty years after his father at what was by then called the Royal \u0026ldquoDick Veterinary College.\nJames and his wife died at a young age and his brother and sister, Charles and Elizabeth, carried on the business successfully as well as raising James\u0026rsquos family of two boys.\nJohn Ker, as said, served his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and also qualified as a veterinary surgeon. About 1916 the smiddy closed when the farriers went to war.\nJohn Ker served as a captain with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and on his return practiced locally as a veterinary surgeon until he died after a short illness towards the end of 1938. The smiddy, itself, \u0026ldquodid its bit during hostilities, by billeting troops.\nIt did not reopen after the war and operate at its former level of business as blacksmiths and engineers. It did, however, remain in general use and is currently a joiner\u0026rsquos workshop.\nJohn Ker was also the last \u0026ldquoBoxmaster (minute secretary) of the Peebles Incorporation of Hammermen\u0026mdashthe blacksmiths\u0026rsquo once exclusive and powerful guild.\nIt fell to him to record in the minutes, rather regretfully, \u0026ldquoThere was no meeting and no dinner held in 1927\u0026mdashfitting, his forebear had been one of the founding signatories we believe. Times had changed, the calling had lost its prosperous and confident ambience, and that was a fact.\nThese events resonate with the story of Black Beauty\u0026rsquos life over a hundred years ago in Victorian England.\nSome of his memories were happy and some were very sad, none less so than those when he meets his old friend Ginger . . .\n"},{"url":null,"title":"40 week one-way system introduced in Jedburgh","story":"A TEMPORARY one-way system has been in introduced in Jedburgh to allow work to be carried out to a privately-owned dangerous building.\nThe new arrangement, which began on Monday (June 4), has seen a section of the High Street become one-way southbound from Jewellers Wynd to Canongate southbound, and a section of Exchange Street one-way northbound from High Street to Friarsgate.\nThis one-way system is required to extend scaffolding onto the road to allow for repairs to be carried out to the building, which has significant structural issues and needs extensive work to make it safe.\nThe disruption is expected to last 40 weeks, and a temporary walkway has also been introduced around the scaffolding to allow pedestrians to still use High Street and Exchange Street.\nSignage is in place to make people aware of the temporary arrangement.\nA joint statement by Jedburgh and District councillors Jim Brown, Scott Hamilton, Sandy Scott said: \u0026ldquoThe High Street dangerous building is a complex and long running issue, but the council is making progress and needs to introduce this temporary one-way system to carry out further repairs.\n\u0026ldquoThe council is looking at various options for the future of the building, and a report is expected to be discussed later this year.\n\u0026ldquoWe thank townsfolk for their patience so far, and would ask they comply with the temporary one-way system.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Borders parking issues working group calls for evidence from public","story":"A CALL for evidence on parking issues in Borders town centres has been issued by Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos Parking Issues Working Group.\nThe working group is currently gathering evidence and researching what happens in other local authority areas and will report back to the Executive Committee later this year with recommendations.\nAn online survey has now been launched to give local people and businesses the opportunity to provide evidence of any issues faced in their communities.\nCouncillor Gordon Edgar, Executive Member for Roads and Infrastructure and chair of the working group, said: \u0026ldquoAs part of our evidence gathering we want to hear from people on specific places, days and times when parking is a problem.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre.

Rockers Altered Sky are fulfilling their ambition of playing at Download Festival, Britain\u0026rsquos premier hard rock and heavy metal festival, on Thursday, June 7, with plans for a UK summer tour also set to be announced in the coming weeks.  The band, which includes Haddington\u0026rsquos Ana Nowosielska and Amy Blair, will be the main support in the Doghouse Tent, with the gig taking place the day before the main festival gets under way.  Ana, the band\u0026rsquos lead singer, was excited \u0026ldquobeyond words ahead of the festival, which is celebrating its 16th year.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt is up there with a childhood dream.  \u0026ldquoYou would go to Download and see Slipknot and Metallica and we are going to be playing there as well.  \u0026ldquoIt is absolutely amazing.  The band is looking at hiring a van and staying for the four-day festival at Donington Park, which this year is headlined by Avenged Sevenfold, Guns N\u0026rsquo Roses and Ozzy Osbourne.  Ana added: \u0026ldquoDownload is definitely one of our goals.  \u0026ldquoIt is one of the biggest music festivals in the UK, especially for our type of music.  \u0026ldquoIt is very much suited to where we want to be.  Currently the band\u0026rsquos attention is focused on creating their second album, the follow-up to Without Wonderland.  The five-piece will soon head down to Wales to record the album, with a view to it being released in the New Year.  Ana, 28, said: \u0026ldquoEverything has been a lot easier this time.  \u0026ldquoWe were joking the other day and saying we had a good five years to write the first album and now we have had six months to write the second album.  \u0026ldquoThe difference is we are definitely going to see that the album is going to stand by itself.  The band are then hoping to get back on the open road, with a UK tour being organised and the band keen to venture further afield again.  Last autumn, the band enjoyed a 19-date tour which saw them performing in the Philippines and Japan.  Ana told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are obviously talking about going back to Asia again. We met so many good people and made so many wonderful relationships.  \u0026ldquoWe would like to tour Europe \u0026ndash hit up Germany and we had an Italian tour in the works a year ago which fell through.  \u0026ldquoThen, of course, we would like to get over to the USA.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe reporter will ensure that the local development plan and the community\u0026rsquos views are taken into account prior to making a recommendation to ministers, who will make the final decision."},{"url":null,"title":"LOOKING BACK  Remembering the first ever Haddington Festival","story":"              HADDINGTON Festival is celebrating its golden anniversary at the moment, with the event having put a smile on thousands of faces since 1968.

Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7864264.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"SEPA water quality report  how clean is the water at your beach ","story":"              A MUSSELBURGH beach has been branded \u0026lsquopoor\u0026rsquo for its water quality in a report by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.  A total of 31,604 kilos of food was given out last year by the county\u0026rsquos foodbank, with 50,292kgs donated.  Peter Dicker, foodbank manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to provide vital support when it matters most \u0026ndash we\u0026rsquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community with no money for food are able to access emergency support, and that has only been possible in the last year because of the incredible generosity shown by local people in donating food, time and funds.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.

As many as 1,600 homes \u0026ndash as well as business units, a supermarket, primary school and various green spaces \u0026ndash are planned for the former opencast mine site at Blindwells.  The first housebuilder is expected to be announced this summer, with work on housing getting under way potentially by the end of the year.  In the meantime, preparatory work has been carried out on the site, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie and Port Seton.  Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.  Iain Slater, development and estates director, said the new exit would be permanent, although it would initially be limited to construction traffic.  Other works are planned for the junction, which links the A1 with the A198.  Mr Slater said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the permission the road layout will be altered to allow for the additional cars generated from the Blindwells development.  \u0026ldquoThese works include widening of the A198 approaching the roundabout to increase capacity [as well as] the installation of a filter lane to allow cars leaving the A1 heading east to go round to Tranent without stopping at the roundabout. There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.  Construction work on the 1,600 homes could take 12-15 years, with early plans already drawn up for a second phase further to the east which could see another 1,600 homes, as well as leisure space and a cemetery."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7870497.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Tranent singer Caitlyn Vanbeck  39 s first single takes charts by storm","story":"              TRANENT singer Caitlyn Vanbeck\u0026rsquos first single flew up the charts when it was released on Monday.

Andrew Yorkston parked his vehicle in a lay-by near to Drummohr Holiday Park and left the two youngsters in the back seat of the locked car for about 30 minutes on a hot summer\u0027s day.  The six-year-old girl and two-year-old boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl banging on the car windows and screaming: \u0026ldquoHelp, save us.  The worried passers-by contacted the police and waited by the car to calm the kids before Yorkston eventually appeared, claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been [away] five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 27-year-old then drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  On Tuesday, Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard that Yorkston was in charge of the children when he was taking them to a nearby McDonald\u0027s and stopped off unexpectedly at the lay-by near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane told the court that the two-year-old boy and the six-year-old girl were spotted locked in the car at about 5.30pm.  Mr Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who were very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe six-year-old was shouting: \u0026lsquoHelp, save us.\u0026rsquo  The girl pointed to an opening in the trees and told the passers-by that the man looking after her was down there, the court heard.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, said that Yorkston, of North Grange Avenue, had stopped for a toilet break and his wife had been left \u0026ldquosuitably unimpressed by his actions.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  The solicitor added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0027s and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme.  \u0026ldquoFortunately there was no harm down to the children.  Sheriff Adrian Cottam deferred sentence to next month.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7806713.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"WHO admits mistaking Prestonpans for Preston on official pollution figures","story":"              THE World Health Organisation (WHO) has removed Prestonpans from its list of most polluted communities. . . after confirming that it had confused the East Lothian town with the English city of Preston!

The annual list used readings taken from 2013 and named Prestonpans as the worst offender in Scotland.  WHO released a similar report two years ago which also named and shamed Prestonpans \u0026ndash yet it was thought then that the reported high pollution levels in the town related to the former Cockenzie Power Station, which had been operational until March 2013.  However, East Lothian Council told the Courier earlier this month that it believed the reading was actually down to a geographical error by WHO, claiming that the organisation had confused Prestonpans with Preston in Lancashire, nearly 200 miles away.  And this week, the WHO confirmed that this was indeed the case.  In an email to senior environmental health officials at the local authority, representatives of WHO confirmed that they had confused the two communities due to a computer mapping error.  They said: \u0026ldquoIt is true that there was a mislabel in the datum for Prestonpans, which should have been labelled as Preston.  \u0026ldquoThis error originated in the previous database release when reverse geocoding the coordinates from the EEA (European Economic Area).

Significant investments in facilities for the whole family such as a 6-hole Par 3 course with complimentary child membership and an extensive practice facility for keen golfers eager to perfect their game has uniquely positioned the club.

The real clincher was the massive practice area which has two full size greens with bunkers, a six-hole par 3 course, putting green and driving range. My two boys are really keen on golf, so having such an impressive practice facility that they can use to learn and enjoy the game is important.

However, for nearly a decade, the ground breaking arts company NVA seemed to have found new hope, and a future, for St Peter\u0027s Seminary in Cardross.  But now that future has been derailed, after the announcement that the company will close in September this year.  NVA, an acclaimed and innovative company led by creative director Angus Farquhar, will cease operations this year, months after losing out in the controversial Regular Funding decisions made by Creative Scotland, the arts funding body.  The closure of NVA: St Peter\u0027s saved from perdition, but cast back into limbo  Last night, the culture secretary, Fiona Hyslop, asked Historic Environment Scotland to study the former seminary, designed and built by the late Glasgow architects Andy MacMillan and Isi Metzstein in 1966, and report on its \"long term options.\"  Ms Hyslop said she would like the building to \"continue to fascinate and inspire the public\" and noted that she was \"very sad\" that NVA is to close, adding \"since its foundation 25 years ago, it has earned a reputation as one of the most innovative public arts companies.\"  The building, an impressive and foreboding modernist ruin in the Kilmahew woodland of Dunbartonshire, is A-listed, and the World Monument Fund has it scheduled as one of the world\u0027s most endangered cultural landmarks.  NVA staged the Hinterland project in the ruins in 2016, and this year have made a film with artist Rachel Maclean, but its long term \u0026pound11m project to transform the \"stablised ruins\" into a cultural centre and performance space is over.  Since 2013, NVA spent \u0026pound2.3m on the building, including removing hazardous waste and asbestos, the restoration of 80 vaults, improving paths, clearing away invasive plants, and woodland management in the 104 acre site.  Revealed: The Mackintosh design you chose for our print giveaway  The building still belongs to the Archdiocese of Glasgow, for which a spokesman said: \"We are sorry to learn of the closure of NVA and the subsequent impact on plans to secure and develop the former St Peter\u0026rsquos College at Cardross.  \"NVA were visionary in their hopes for the college site and it is a great shame that these hopes will not now be realised.  \"The Archdiocese will now consider its options and consider any proposal to develop the site in a way which will secure the architecture of the former college and benefit the local community.\"  NVA\u0027s other works include the Hidden Gardens at the Tramway in Glasgow, The Secret Sign in Finnich Glen, a show in Central Hotel in 1999, Grand Central, and The Path in Glen Lyon in 2000.  It also staged The Storr: Unfolding Landscapes on the Isle of Skye in 2005 and Speed of Light, initially commissioned as part of the UK\u0026rsquos 2012 Cultural Olympiad.  A board statement said: \"In September of last year the trustees of NVA made the difficult decision to withdraw from the capital project plans to rescue St Peter\u0026rsquos Seminary in Cardross, due to increasing risks, both financial and physical.  \"NVA\u0026rsquos original plan for St Peter\u0026rsquos was universally acknowledged as bold, with creative ambition at its heart.  \"It was also recognised as a high risk venture for a small independent arts organisation.  \"NVA has spent many years working with great passion and determination, with the support of the owners of the site, the Archdiocese of Glasgow, to save this iconic building for future generations.  \"We collaborated with public and private stakeholders, the local communities and an amazing design team.  \"Important work was done to begin to preserve and restore the building and to demonstrate the immense creative, intellectual and community potential of the site.\"  The closure of NVA: St Peter\u0027s saved from perdition, but cast back into limbo  However, it adds: \"Despite our best efforts we were unable to guarantee the viable future for the St Peter\u0026rsquos Seminary that we had imagined and hoped for. In the end, we had no choice but to bring the capital project to an end.\"  NVA said it has tried to develop an \"alternative proposal\" for the site, but this has not proved possible and \"has reinforced the many financial and structural challenges facing the company.\"  The board said that NVA is now \"not able to continue\".  A Creative Scotland spokeswoman said: \"NVA has been one of Scotland\u0026rsquos most creatively ambitious companies, producing ground-breaking work that has attracted national and international attention, including their ambitious plans for St. Peter\u0026rsquos Seminary.  \"We appreciate how difficult this decision has been for the Board and staff of NVA and will continue to offer support and advice to all those involved.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Young influencers in Edinburgh digital tourism push","story":"              ONLINE influencers are being recruited to help boost young traveller numbers to Edinburgh.

A survey by the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) found 58 per cent were \u0026ldquounlikely to endorse a career in teaching. Only two per cent would be \u0026ldquovery likely to do so.  The greatest concern was spiralling workload with 85 per cent saying it had increased in the past year - despite a pledge by John Swinney, the Education Secretary, to tackle the problem.  Read more: John Swinney\u0027s war on workload a long way from being won  Changes to the curriculum were seen as a key area of dissatisfaction while teacher shortages and stagnant pay were also highlighted.  The findings comes after a sustained period of upheaval in education with significant changes to the curriculum and associated exams.  Schools are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit staff in some subjects creating additional work for the remaining staff.  Concerns of individual teachers were also included in the EIS survey with one stating: \u0026ldquoThe curriculum becomes more cluttered every year ... everything taught at a rushed and superficial pace.  Another said: \u0026ldquoStaffing shortages have created a significant increase in workload.  Teachers said the fall in the number of support staff to deal with children with conditions such as autism and dyslexia was creating extra pressure.  Another said: \u0026ldquoWorkload has reached a point that it significantly impacts on my home life.  \u0026ldquoI have less time with my family and feel more stressed. I am so tired at the end of the school day and then have more work to do at home. It is depressing.  Read more: Workload blamed for teacher exodus  Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS, described the survey results as \u0026ldquoworrying reading.  \u0026ldquoDespite statements from the Scottish Government, local authorities and national education bodies that promised action to tackle excessive levels of teacher workload, the results of our survey indicate little has improved and some difficulties actually seems to have grown worse, he said.  \u0026ldquoWe have frequently been told that meaningful pay rises are unaffordable, but that extra teachers are being employed and that workload is being tackled.  \u0026ldquoThese survey results confirm that teachers are seeing little improvement, and that severe pressure continues to be piled onto our overworked, undervalued and underpaid teachers.  Opposition parties blamed the Scottish Government for the concerns.  Iain Gray, education spokesman for Scottish Labour said: \u0026ldquoScotland has thousands fewer teachers since the SNP came to power, and with most professionals not recommending the job it could get even worse.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos time John Swinney restored teachers\u0026rsquo pay and gave our children the resources they need to succeed in school.

Food giant Heinz is set to ditch the famous name for the first time in 104 years claiming that as only 14 per cent of buyers actually used the gloopy white sauce on salads, the old name no longer reflects its modern purpose.  A spokesman for Heinz said that the name no longer \"fairly represents the product\u0027s ingredients or usage occasions.\"  Parent group Kraft Heinz said it was working with brand design specialists Jones Knowles Ritchie on overhauling one of Britain\u0027s longest running kitchen staples.  It would be the first name change for the product since its launch in 1914.    Fans of the traditional name went on social media to express their anger.  It is believed Heinz is considering adopting the name Sandwich Cream to better reflect how the country uses the condiment and to appeal to \"younger shoppers\".  UK sales of the brand dipped 5.4 per cent to \u0026pound28.8 million last year.  A Heinz spokesman added: \"As a market leading business, Kraft Heinz continues to audit its portfolio in order to meet the needs of consumers.  \"There are consumers now who haven\u0027t grown up with the brand in the household and just don\u0027t know about the iconic zingy flavour or what to eat it with.\"  The consultation process means the earliest a new name will be introduced is in September.    The condiment became a national favourite during the 1940s, Heinz says, when ketchup was unavailable and salad cream was used to add flavour to bland war-time rations.  In 1999, it was revealed that Heinz were about to ditch the brand but once the leak was published it led to a major protest by shoppers and it saved the brand.  The publicity helped sales and Heinz took advantage by relaunching Salad Cream in new-look packs and putting the price up."},{"url":null,"title":"UK Government defends RBS shares sale at   2 1bn loss  saying it s  value for money ","story":"              THE UK Government has defended the sale of a 7.7 per cent stake in Royal Bank of Scotland at a \u0026pound2.1 billion loss to the UK taxpayer, insisting it was \"value for money\".  Lord Bates, the Treasury spokesman, dismissed criticism of the move from Labour and the Liberal Democrats in the Lords.  Answering an urgent question, he said the sale would raise \u0026pound2.5bn, representing \"value for money for the taxpayer\".  The Conservative peer said RBS was a \"smaller, simpler and safer organisation\" than the one the Government was forced to recapitalise in 2008 at a cost to the taxpayer of \u0026pound46bn and the sale price reflected that \"reality\".  But Liberal Democrat Baroness Kramer demanded: \"Why sell now crystallising a loss that rises to in excess of \u0026pound3bn when financing costs are included and when there is no pressure..?\"  She warned that by acting now the Government could be selling shares on an \"inaccurate prospectus, ignoring growing allegations that liabilities to those abused by RBS\u0027s global restructuring group... are inadequately quantified, not declared and not provided for within the accounts\".  But Lord Bates said that when the Government paid 502p per share in 2008 it was an \"essential injection of capital\" at a time of financial crisis the bank was now, he insisted, in a very different organisation.  Labour spokesman Lord Davies of Oldham said the shares were being sold at a \"massive level below\" the 2008 bailout with the taxpayer bearing the cost and leaving the public to \"lose on the deal significantly\".  Lord Bates hit back, telling him: \"You may say we sold it too cheaply. I might say that you bought it too high.\"  He said the price was \"near the top end of the yearly average\" and the Government had signalled it shouldn\u0027t be in the business of \"running these banks\".  Tory former Cabinet minister Lord King of Bridgwater backed the sale as being an \"entirely sensible procedure to bring in some money while we can\".  Lord Bates said the Opposition was forgetting what the situation was in 2008 and the \"incredible damage done to our economy, which we are still having to clear up\".  He said the sale proceeds would go directly to reduce the debt accumulated in 2008.  Outwith Parliament, Gordon Brown, who was Prime Minister when the bank was bailed out, said there was \"no excuse\" for selling the shares at under their potential value.  Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, also insisted there was no need to sell the RBS shares now.  \u0026ldquoThere was no need for the Conservatives to cost the taxpayer more than \u0026pound2bn, he declared.  \"There is continuing uncertainty on a number of RBS\u0026rsquo legacy issues. Ministers should instead have been using their position as the biggest shareholder to make sure management put the bank in order so that the share price recovered before selling any of the stake,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"Scotland s last great auk to be immortalised in bronze","story":"              STANDING three feet tall, with a curved black beak and glossy black and white feathers, it was one of the most impressive birds ever to call Scotland its home.  The great auk was the country\u0026rsquos answer to the penguin \u0026ndash large, flightless and ungainly on land, yet fast and agile in the water. Yet in the end they became Scotland\u0026rsquos dodo, wiped out by the carelessness of men who hunted them for their meat and feathers, and doomed the species to extinction.  Today, all that remains of the great auk is their little cousins \u0026ndash puffins, razorbills and other seabirds of the same family \u0026ndash and a few preserved remains floating in jars and stuffed carcasses on museum shelves.  Now preparations are being made to commemorate one of the final members of the species to be killed in Scotland with a bronze replica.  The great auk was one of a pair which nested on the Orkney island of Papa Westray, and met its demise at the hands of hunters in 1813. Six years later, in 1819, the bird\u0026rsquos stuffed remains were purchased by the Natural History Museum, and it is only British specimen in existence.  A clay statue was made of the bird to mark the spot where it had been shot, at Fowl Crag, on the north of the island, but this was damaged in a recent storm and lost its head. Although it has been repaired, the replica is only 10in tall and plans are being made to use scans which were taken of its stuffed remains to have a life-size version made in bronze. Jonathan Ford, the ranger on Papa Westray who repaired the damaged clay version, said that a new statue would be a fitting tribute to one of the last great auks of Scotland.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll always keep the original statue \u0026ndash there\u0026rsquos a lot of history with it and it\u0026rsquos got a long association with the island. But the bronze statue would be life-size and a model of the actual bird which was taken from here, so it would be like it is coming home. They used to be widespread on Papa Westray, and it is very sad that the last ones were driven into extinction.  Great auks ranged over much of the north Atlantic for thousands of years and could be found nesting in crags and cliffs from America to Europe.  Used as a food source, their remains have been found in sites that were home to Neanderthals in Gibraltar 100,000 years ago, while early humans daubed their images on cave walls 35,000 years ago.  One great auk bone dating from the fifth century was uncovered recently near the Scottish Seabird Centre in North Berwick, indicating they were also eaten by medieval Scots.  However, they were hunted relentlessly in the 18th and 19th century as European ships spread out across the globe, with sailors using them as living larders they could pack on to boats. Their feathers, which were rich with oil, were also highly prized both as a fuel source and by the down industry as filling for quilts.  Tales have come down from the era of great auks being herded on to boats in large flocks, or used as fuel on treeless islands because they burned so easily.  Their persecution was famously cruel, with hunters advised to strip their feathers while the birds were still alive before leaving them to perish from the elements.  Britain banned the killing of the bird in 1794, except by fishermen. But by then it was too late.  The final great auk found in the British Isles is said to have been taken on a sea stack off of St Kilda, by fishermen hunting gannets.  They tied its feet and took it onboard their boat, only to become superstitious and fearful a few days later during a storm. Believing the bird to be \u0026ldquoa maelstrom-conjuring witch, they beat it to death. The last known great auks were killed on the island of Elday, off the coast of Iceland, by sailors hunting them for a museum collector in 1844.  Scottish Seabird Centre chief executive, Tom Brock said: \u0026ldquoThe really important thing is it reminds us that animals are still going extinct, even in Scotland. We should not take them for granted. One of the great auk\u0026rsquos close relatives, the puffin, has been put on to the red endangered list.  \u0026ldquoWe must protect and conserve safeguard seabird populations or more species will go the same way as the great auk."},{"url":null,"title":"Corbyn to push for  new single market  deal in crunch Commons vote","story":"              LABOUR is to push for a \"new single market\" deal for the UK after Brexit as the UK Government faces crunch votes in the Commons next week.

Without an overall majority, the Prime Minister is expected to spend the coming days trying to sweet-talk and strong-arm potential rebels who could inflict defeat on some of the Government\u0027s key Brexit positions.  In response to Labour\u0026rsquos amendment, Suella Braverman, the Brexit Minister, said: \"Labour have shattered their promise to respect the referendum result this amendment means accepting free movement and continuing to follow EU rules with absolutely no say in them, which is the worst of all worlds.  \"Only the Conservatives will get the best deal for the whole country - delivering on the referendum vote to get control of our money, borders and laws, while building a strong new relationship with Europe.\"  READ MORE:\u0026nbspPoll suggests anti-Brexit feeling at highest level since aftermath of 2016 referendum  Stephen Gethins for the SNP said: \"Any Brexit scenario is damaging but remaining in the single market and customs union would be the least worst option to protect the economy, jobs and livelihoods.  \"Labour need to quit playing games and do the right thing support the UK\u0027s continued membership of the single market and customs union,\" added the Fife MP.

And in the last ten years the small arts charity, led by Angus Farquhar - who previously had been in the industrial music group Test Department - also wrought significant change at St Peter\u0027s Seminary.

But ultimately, without a major national institution to step in (which, at some point, perhaps NVA was half expecting to happen) and provide funding, scale and stability, the project proved too much. The public money that was raised for the project and not used was paid back last year. The company will close without lurching into bankruptcy, I am told. But NVA is over, and who knows if art work like Speed of Light or The Path in Glen Lyon will be attempted again.

In January, in the Regular Funding round which has been the cause of much controversy and debate, NVA were not granted regular funding. It had been funded before. At the time it seemed a surprising decision, but was somewhat lost in the tumult surrounding similar decisions in theatre and music.

It was rather moving, and brought home the extent to which the metropolis truly is a multicultural city. It\u0026rsquos sometimes hard to believe that the indigenous white population is still in a majority here.  Step off the train back in Scotland and you are in a different world. Scotland remains a conspicuously white nation. Indeed, the most visible social difference now between Scotland and England today is arguably not nationality, but race. Despite a significant increase in immigration in the past decade, Black And Minority Ethnic \u0026ndash BAME \u0026ndash still really means that: minority. In the last census there were only around 40,000 Afro-Carribbeans recorded as living in the whole of Scotland.  Which makes it doubly ludicrous that the Home Office seems determined to expel those few who make it here, such as the student nurse, Denzel Darku. He has lost two appeals against deportation on the grounds that he cannot prove he is dependent on his father, who lives in Edinburgh and is an EU citizen. This is typical of the Catch-22 rules that have grown up like a dense thicket around our immigration law since Theresa May introduced her \u0026ldquohostile environment to migrants five years ago.  READ MORE: Home Secretary Sajid Javid expresses \u0027sympathy\u0027 to student nurse battling to stay in Scotland  It makes no sense that this capable and responsible young man, who was a member of the Scottish Youth Parliament and carried the Queen\u0026rsquos Baton at the Commonwealth Games, is likely to be deported after his final appeal next week. The Home Secretary Sajid Javid said yesterday that he was \u0026ldquosympathetic, but this will cut little ice with the hard-faced men and women of the British immigration service, for whom \u0026ldquocomputer says no is the whole of the law.  It is often said that hostility to immigration grows in inverse proportion to the number of immigrants actually living in a given area. Hence, diverse London voted for Remain, while Brexit, and Ukip, are stronger in white English townships. But that rule doesn\u0026rsquot seem to apply to Scotland. There is racism if you care to look for it, of course. But it is obvious from the composition of the Scottish Parliament that race and immigration are not significant political issues in Scotland. You rarely see those \u0026ldquoMigrant Crisis front pages that have disgraced English news-stands in recent years because newspaper readers don\u0026rsquot buy them.  At First Minister\u0026rsquos Questions in Holyrood, the Scottish parties united to jeer and goad Ruth Davidson and the Scottish Tories when they failed to voice support for the First Minister in her defence of Mr Darku. Some Tory MSPs allegedly cried \u0026ldquosend him home, which to me seems most unlikely because casual hostility to immigrants is not tolerated in Ruth Davidson\u0026rsquos party. Woe betide the Scottish Tory councillor who makes even a daft joke about immigrants. To be fair to the Conservatives, they have never seriously attempted to make race and immigration an issue in Scotland, because they know there are no votes in it.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspNicola Sturgeon attacks \u0027shameful\u0027 Tory silence on deportation case  Yet in England, immigration remains a massive issue that underpinned the Brexit vote, and still has politicians of all parties running scared. This week, Mrs May repeated her nonsense proposal to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands \u0026ndash a target which would be economically ruinous to Britain if it were even remotely achievable. The UK economy has benefited from immigration, largely in recent years from the European Union. Migrants invariably come to Britain to work and to pay taxes, which have helped to pay for public services and run the NHS.  Scotland needs immigrants more than the rest of the UK because our population is ageing faster than the rest of the UK. This in turn is partly because low-growth Scotland continues to lose qualified younger workers because of the lack of jobs here. This is not going to change any time soon. The Scottish Fiscal Commission has forecast that Scottish growth will remain at near-recession levels of less than one per cent for the next five years. If there are able and industrious young people who want to come to Scotland to work and contribute, like Mr Darku, we should be doing everything possible to keep them here.  It beggars belief that the UK Government doesn\u0026rsquot see this. The refusal to meet the First Minister\u0026rsquos calls for the devolution of immigration policy makes no political sense. Mrs May could undermine the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquopower grab claims about the impact of the EU Withdrawal Bill, by promising a regionally-based immigration regime, such as exists in Canada or Australia. It would shoot Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos fox. She\u0026rsquod find it harder to argue that Scotland was losing out because of Brexit and Westminster insensitivity to Scottish concerns.  One suspects Mr Javid would introduce such a policy if he could, and is plainly embarrassed by UK policy as a whole. Michael Gove, the UK Environment Secretary and one of the leading figures in Vote Leave, said before the Brexit referendum that immigration was one of the powers that should come to Scotland after Brexit. All that would be necessary would be to ensure that those migrants who came to Scotland to work were recorded as living here. This will happen anyway since they now have a Scottish tax code.  READ MORE: Home Secretary Sajid Javid expresses \u0027sympathy\u0027 to student nurse battling to stay in Scotland  It\u0026rsquos not as if the UK\u0026rsquos existing immigration policy makes any sense. Mr Javid is desperately trying to find a way of removing the Tier 2 cap that has been preventing much-needed doctors and other highly-qualified people migrating to the UK. Daft earnings requirements are denuding the NHS of nurses and other lower paid workers. It is absurd that 450,000 international students are included in the immigration statistics, since few will remain here. The Windrush scandal has visibly changed attitudes towards our racist immigration rules, which led to British citizens being deported, and others denied housing because of their colour. England needs a new immigration system as much as Scotland. Theresa May needs to overcome her fear of Ukip and let her apparently open-minded new Home Secretary create one."},{"url":null,"title":"Ken Smith  39 s Diary  Flight of fancy  Just the job and Pass the hankie","story":"              Flight of fancy  THE Government has backed the building of a third runway for Heathrow Airport which has angered a number of environmental campaigners.

He accused Mrs May of cornering herself into a \"catastrophic negotiating position\", and claimed jobs, the Irish border and the economy have been an \"afterthought\".  During PMQs, Mr Blackford said: \"For this Government in the negotiations, jobs have been an afterthought, the Irish border has been an afterthought, the economy at all costs has been an afterthought.  \"While the leader of the opposition is playing games, the question he should have asked today is: will the Prime Minister stop her charade and vote for the Lords amendments next week for membership of the EEA and the customs union, protecting jobs and prosperity?\"  Mrs May said jobs were \"absolutely at the forefront\" of the Government\u0027s future trade partnership considerations.  She continued: \"He talks about the Northern Ireland border: the leader of the opposition complains that we\u0027re giving too much attention to getting the answer right for the Northern Ireland border and the leader of the Scottish Nationalists says that we\u0027re using it as an afterthought.  \"We are committed to ensuring that there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, we also want to ensure as frictionless trade as possible with the European Union and that we are able to operate our independent trade policy.  \"All of those are about ensuring that we protect jobs here in the United Kingdom.\"  Mr Blackford also referred to reports civil servants have been drawing up scenarios for a \"Doomsday Brexit\" that would leave the country short of medicine, fuel and food.  He said: \"Supermarkets running out of food within days, hospitals running out of medicines within a fortnight, petrol reserves dwindling after just two weeks: these are the concerns of UK Government officials.  \"And now the Dutch are telling Dutch businesses not to risk buying UK products.  \"Does the Prime Minister understand the catastrophic negotiating position she has cornered herself into?\"  Mrs May told Mr Blackford that supermarket chains in Scotland said \"one of the most important things for Scotland\" was to remain part of the United Kingdom."}]
