And if he expects to be able to speak to a future boss in this tone when asked for work due by a specific deadline.Even if we strive to empower today’s adolescents, even perhaps to treat them as equals, there is a hierarchical difference between a student and a teacher and it needs to be reflected in interactions between them.Artificial intelligence and technological advances threaten lots of aspects of the human labour force. Covid may have dramatically changed education and accelerated progress in many respects, but it has not given rise to anything which suggests that the human teacher is now an endangered species.What we facilitate has less and less to do with learning to learn or to work, and more and more to do with learning to live and interact with others.Human contact facilitates the growth and learning of young people in ways that simply cannot be replicated digitally or robotically. When young people use their devices to look something up, the very fact that this resource is so readily available conditions them away from memorising.The whole concept of the search button at one’s fingertips negates the need to remember. We teachers play an invaluable role as daily reminders of the need to maintain brain elasticity as well as digital agility.As a teacher my word has never been gospel, but students came a lot closer to hanging on every one three decades ago than they do today. From a knowledge perspective, students simply don’t need us as much as they used to. And so we human teachers must work at maintaining our indispensability. The less essential our store of knowledge becomes to the pupils, the more crucial it is to drive the human connection.Relationships with young people may have changed and evolved dramatically but everyone in Irish classrooms still remain fundamentally human.E-learning and self-directed learning are already fully viable options, but they are far from the norm in compulsory education. Schools remained closed for months during 2020 and learning content was both captured and delivered digitally in whole new ways. Youngsters are comfortable in the tech and digital worlds. Too comfortable, if the speed at which they reach for their phones is any indication.Where they are less comfortable is in the area of social behaviour. Some young people challenge me in ways that I know they see as empowered, the way Séamus did when I asked for his work. They forget (or perhaps they have never known!) that there is a level of politeness from which nobody gets an exemption.For me personally this is not about how young people “speak to adults”, even if for many grown-ups this is still very much a thing. If young people want and expect us to treat them as equals, this involves them ensuring that their brand of empowerment is more that of a fully fledged adult than of an embarrassing wannabe adult.Many of the most recent examples of this that I have encountered have been in the tone of voice used to address me. Defensive responses delivered in the absence of any trace of attack from me.Schools are making particular efforts to upload work now to accommodate those forcibly absent due to Covid. Given that we generally upload work for classes rather than iniduals there is a reasonable expectation on our part that absence from school (for any reason) does not amount to missing out on work or offer an opportunity to avoid submitting a task.Nonetheless, “I wasn’t here” remains the mantra, almost without exception delivered in a wary so “why are you even asking me” tone. Exchanges such as these are among the most exhausting things about teaching. What everyone outside the profession fails to realise is that Séamus is only one of the 250 students I teach each week. And that because I teach 11 different class groups across 32 periods weekly I cannot actually hope to remember off the top of my head who exactly was absent when. (And could the robot? I find myself wondering.)And so the real lesson on offer here for Séamus is how to conduct himself in such interactions. It is an invitation to look at the broader context and recognise that perhaps I’m asking in error and need to have that pointed out to me, politely. He may learn to avoid being defensive where there is no need to be, and in this case to recognise that the work has been made available and that my request for it is, in fact, perfectly reasonable.These lessons will serve him well when he has a paid role and a human boss – an inidual with reasonable expectations that their employees have the appropriate social and soft skills to function effectively in a human workplace community.We too easily reserve the opportunity to learn such things for CSPE, SPHE and, more recently, the overall umbrella of the Wellbeing hours in schools. To compartmentalise in that way is to dangerously underestimate our value as real-life, human teachers. We play a fundamental role in young people’s formative years at a time when the technological takeover advances rapidly. What we teachers do when we are at our best demonstrates the very limits of technology.And long may that last.Without us in their lives, what would Séamus and his mates be like when they join the workforce?"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"employers to have at least 13 grounds to refuse remote working requests","story":"Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment Leo Varadkar launches details of new law giving workers the right to request remote working at Dublin Castle on Tuesday afternoon. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins Photos Employers will be able to refuse to grant an employee’s right to work remotely on at least 13 different grounds under draft legislation published on Tuesday. However, they will have to be able to justify the decision if it is appealed by the worker. Tánaiste Leo Varadkar unveiled plans to give workers the right to request remote working after draft legislation was approved by Cabinet. He said that up until now remote and home working had been imposed on people due to public health restrictions imposed during the pandemic. “Now that they have been lifted, I want it to be a choice. I want workers to be able to work from home or remotely or hybrid if they want to.” Employers will have to respond to a worker’s request for remote working within three months. If they decline the request they will have to offer “reasonable business grounds for doing so” which under the legislation may include, but are not limited to, 13 different reasons. They include that the nature of the work does not allow for the work to be done remotely that the work cannot be reorganised among existing staff and it would have a potential negative impact on either work quality or performance. Planned structural changes, the burden of additional costs and concern for the protection of business confidentiality or intellectual property are other grounds listed. Concerns over the suitability of the proposed workspace on health and safety grounds or on data protection grounds are also cited as grounds. Employers can also refuse to grant remote working if there are concerns about internet connectivity of the proposed remote working location or there is and inordinate distance between the proposed remote location and on-site location. They can also refuse if the proposed remote working arrangement conflicts with the provisions of an applicable collective agreement. And the request can be refused if there is an ongoing or recently concluded formal disciplinary processes. Under the legislation appeals can be brought internally or to the Workplace Relations Commission or both. Opposition politicians have claimed that the Government proposals do not go far enough and have called for people to be given the right to remote working. Mr Varadkar said an “absolute right” to remote working is “not practical” saying there are a lot of jobs that can’t be done remotely. “Construction, hospitality, care, most of retail, the transport sector, it just wouldn’t be possible to do those jobs from home. “I think most people will understand that.” He said: “In other cases, it might be possible to do job from home or remotely but that would result either in very high costs being burdened on the employer or potentially a diminution in services.” He gave the example of college lecturers or teachers who could provide lectures or lessons online, but added: “that would result in a diminution of service for students.” Mr Varadkar said that what is planned is a “qualified right, but one that I think makes sense and is practical and achievable”. Workers become eligible to apply for remote working once they have been in a job for six months. Employers will have to respond to a worker’s request working within 12 weeks. The employer can say yes make a counter offer with the worker getting a month to consider this or refuse, though if they do this the employer must offer a good reason. Mr Varadkar said that reason will “have to stack up and be solid” and this will be made clear in the final legislation when it is published. Mr Varadkar also said: “We’d intend to have this legislated before the summer recess and certainly in place this year.” "},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord d%C3%A1il s big reopening day turns out to be not so big","story":" Around Leinster House the canteen was purring again with all tables reinstated and the lunchtime buzz well and truly back. TDs were allowed bring guests into the building again. Photograph: Getty ImagesThere was more than a hint of the Hey Presto! about Micheál’s lavish Restoration drama on the steps of Government Buildings.Catherine Connolly was certainly dazzled by the performance. “I know that with a ‘puff!’ from the Magic Dragon the restrictions were lifted at six o’clock last Friday,” acknowledged the Independent TD for Galway West, “and it would be churlish of me not to recognise the sense of relief and excitement felt by a lot of people.”However, the decision was taken outside the Dáil despite Deputies having discussed Covid-19 measures throughout the pandemic. Now TDs are getting phone calls looking for clarification on a number of important issues. People say they are still not allowed into nursing homes to visit their loved ones, and others want to know why daycare centres are not operating. There are also questions about compensation schemes and pandemic payments.She called for “a full and frank discussion on an informed basis on the floor of the Dáil” as soon as possible on the “context of the lifting of Covid restrictions”.The Taoiseach, looking relaxed after enjoying a few restorative Restoration pints over the weekend, was taken by Catherine’s opening line.“It’s the first time I’ve ever been referred to as a magic dragon...” he replied, cracking that knowing little smile of somebody who thinks he is about to say something funny, “... but eh, but there might been a few dragons in it…but, eh…”Whatever the Taoiseach was going to say next about whomever (ears could have been burning down Nphet way or maybe he was thinking about certain Cabinet colleagues) he thought the better of it. Swiftly changing course, he clamped his serious face back on again. “Eh, but in terms of the public health decision I think it is a good idea to have a Dáil debate.”Next week should be a good time, he reckoned. So another lengthy pandemic debate is on the cards, hardly a happy week into the Restoration. This is Long Covid, Leinster House-style, where the humdrum dragons never run out of puff. Old chamberNonetheless there was great excitement in Kildare Street at the prospect of the Dáil returning to full capacity again after almost two years of reduced numbers and passionless politicking. Tuesday was a big day in the old chamber, with no more social distancing required and a welcome for everyone in a free-for-all House.Finally, not forgetting the spaced out months spent wittering for Ireland in the cavernous Dublin Convention Centre, normal service was being resumed.There was great excitement about the place, wasn’t there? Not really.The 2020 intake of first-time TDs did not flood the chamber for their inaugural burning cheek by quivering jowl experience of full-throated roaring during Leaders’ Questions. The old hands, for all their whinging during the unpleasantness about missing the old atmosphere, didn’t bother their booster shots to make it inside either.When the week’s business commenced at 2pm with Micheál and Mary Lou set to potentially perform before a packed hall for the first time in ages, it quickly became clear that there wouldn’t be any need to hang the “house full” signs from the handles.At least Sinn Féin made the effort. Mary Lou McDonald’s troops displayed their trademark discipline and fully populated their portion of the benches, looking like a proper opposition. Full marks to party whip Padraig MacLochlainn for turning them out.The same can’t be said for Government TDs. The Taoiseach was supported by four Ministers, five Junior Ministers and a piffling three coalition backbenchers, none of whom were from his own Fianna Fáil party. It was not a good look. The other parties and groupings fared no better. Six TDsBy contrast Labour leader Alan Kelly, pencilled in for a slot during Leaders’ Questions, managed to muster a full half of his Dáil team for Restoration Day. Impressive, until you realise he only has six TDs. The SocDems were a no-show until later in the proceedings, when Gary Gannon put in an appearance.The main theme was the rising rate of inflation and the Government’s efforts to counteract it. As the cost of living rises and household bills soar, Mary Lou had surprisingly little faith in the coalition’s ability to deal with the mounting crisis.“Far too slow to react,” she said. There has been no “step change” in policy over the last two years. “What we have seen is more of the same,” she told the Taoiseach. Apart from the hike in utility prices, this is also evident in the continuing rise in house prices and rents. “The truth is that you have continued with the same of the same.”Not content with heckling about house prices, Sinn Féin’s property intellectual in residence Eoin Ó Broin also had the time to tweet his thoughts about the Taoiseach’s replies to his leader Mary Lou.“Micheál Martin in total denial about housing, health and cost of living crises in Leaders’ Questions today. Like Waylon Smithers, he is detached from reality, out of touch \u0026amp out of ideas…#Time4Change,” he dashed off while Leaders’ Questions was still in session.Unfortunately multitasking Eoin tweeted a picture of Simpson’s character Monty Burns with his sizzling social media burn. Fortunately his error was quickly corrected and Smithers got the heave-ho in the updated version. MiserlyThe spiraling cost of living – “even pasta has gone by 5 per cent in the last two months” said Alan Kelly – was held up against the Government’s intention to give people €113.50 off their electricity bill, a move which was rubbished by various speakers as “a joke”, “miserly”, “insulting” and “tokenistic”.But the Taoiseach said “targeted ways” were needed to help people achieve acceptable living standards “without adding to the inflationary cycle”. He kept mentioning “the Vincentian Model” as a good system to follow, but didn’t explain what that is.“We need to avoid a wages spiral,” he cautioned.“You didn’t worry about a wages spiral for the general secretary of the Department of Health,” shot back Sinn Féin’s Matt Carthy.Elsewhere around Leinster House the canteen was purring again with all tables reinstated and the lunchtime buzz well and truly back. TDs were allowed bring guests into the building again. And the stools returned to their rightful place at the counter in the bar.Business was very quiet, though. It was well past teatime before the first visitor crossed the threshold for a drink. Anthony Monaghan from Tipperary earned that singular honour, up at the bar enjoying a quick pint courtesy of his host Mattie McGrath, who was delighted that his guest was the first visitor in almost two years to raise a glass in the Dáil bar."},{"url":null,"title":"network of 400 remote working hubs planned by end of year","story":"At present, there are 177 hubs already using the ConnectedHubs.ie platform.

According to the Minister, this figure is expected to increase to 400 by the end of 2022. This is three years ahead of the schedule announced last year by the Government.She is expected to refer to her department having invested millions of euro in funding in the establishment of new remote working hub facilities and also in upgrading existing hub facilities.Upgrade hubsMs Humphreys has said the hubs will facilitate the “working from home” legislation that Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has published this week, which gives employees the right to make a request to their employer to work from home on a part-time or full-time basis.A fund of €9 million was committed last July to upgrade existing hubs and to create new ones.One of the issues that has emerged for people working remotely is a desire to create a distinction between their homes and their work spaces. The idea of having an office-like hub within a short distance of where people live in rural Ireland would address that issue and create a clear demarcation between work and family life.Research conducted by NUI Galway in 2020 showed that as many as 15 per cent of people working in larger urban settings expressed a desire to relocate to rural and smaller urban settings elsewhere in

targeted covid vaccine in us","story":"‘While . . . boosters continue to provide a high level of protection against severe disease and hospitalisation with Omicron, we recognise the need to be prepared in the event this protection wanes over time.’ Photograph:  Mahmud HamsAFP via Getty Images A clinical trial to test a new version of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine specifically designed to target the Covid-19 Omicron variant, which has eluded some of the protection provided by the original two-dose vaccine regimen, has started, the companies said on Tuesday.The companies plan to test the immune response generated by the Omicron-based vaccine both as a three-shot regimen in unvaccinated people and as a booster shot for people who already received two doses of their original vaccine.They are also testing a fourth dose of the current vaccine against a fourth dose of the Omicron-based vaccine in people who received their third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine three to six months earlier.The companies plan to study the safety and tolerability of the shots in the more than 1,400 people who will be enrolled in the trial.“While current research and real-world data show that boosters continue to provide a high level of protection against severe disease and hospitalisation with Omicron, we recognise the need to be prepared in the event this protection wanes over time and to potentially help address Omicron and new variants in the future,” Pfizer’s head of vaccine research and development, Kathrin Jansen, said in a statement.Pfizer has said that a two-dose regimen of the original vaccine may not be sufficient to protect against infection from the Omicron variant, and that protection against hospitalisations and deaths may be waning.Still, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a third dose of an mRNA vaccine such as the PfizerBioNTech vaccine has provided 90 per cent protection against hospitalisation due to Covid-19.Some countries have already started offering additional booster doses, but a recent study from Israel showed that while a fourth dose of an mRNA vaccine boosted antibodies, the level was not high enough to prevent infection by the Omicron variant.BioNTech chief executive Ugur Sahin told Reuters in November that regulators would not likely require testing of an Omicron-based vaccine on humans because it and Pfizer had already created versions of their established vaccine to target the earlier Alpha and Delta variants, with clinical trials continuing.However, the debate appears to have shifted as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said in a statement on Friday that international regulators now preferred clinical studies to be carried out before approval of a new vaccine.These studies should show that neutralising antibodies in the blood of participants are superior to those elicited by current vaccines. Another desired feature of an upgraded vaccine would be for it to also protect against other variants of concern, the EMA said.The Omicron variant has replaced the Delta variant as the dominant lineage in many parts of the world and Omicron itself is now splitting into different subforms, one of which, BA2, is causing particular concern. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Tom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"boris survives mess needs start governing conservative","story":"In the old silent movies, the hero used to extricate himself from his predicament accompanied by the words “with one bound he was free”. The phrase could serve as the political motto of Boris Johnson, dubbed the Great Houdini for confounding previous predictions of his demise.He awoke yesterday morning to find the front pages and TV news broadcasts focusing on a celebration of his birthday during lockdown in apparent breach of the rules. That’s it, said the pundits. All over. Yet by the end of the day, things didn’t look so clear cut.Ms Gray is said to have found prima facie evidence that eight parties breached lockdown regulations, which could result in fines for those involved, possibly even the Prime Minister. Were that to happen it might galvanise Tory MPs into firing off the 54 letters needed to trigger a no-confidence vote.With anger running high with the incessant drip-drip of allegations, Mr Johnson’s best hope of survival is for Tory MPs to shy away from the dislocation that would be caused by a leadership contest. In truth, he is less a Houdini than a Mr Micawber, always confident that something will turn up. Indeed, it already has with the threatened invasion of Ukraine by Russia. Mr Johnson took the chance to make a statesmanlike appearance in the Commons yesterday to call for Western unity in the face of the Kremlin’s aggression.In this he was performing the proper task of the Prime Minister but it allowed him neatly to contrast “Cakegate” with the stark realities of a real crisis. Moreover, when Labour’s Angela Rayner raised the latest revelations in the chamber, a claque of Tory backbenchers had been corralled to support Mr Johnson and emphasise the successful vaccine roll-out, the refusal to enforce tough controls during the omicron surge and the strong diplomatic position the UK has adopted over Ukraine.Perhaps the Prime Minister can see a way out of his plight, charting a path across the political quagmire that would see lesser mortals swallowed in the mud. But there are two questions here – not just can he survive but should he? Many say that his integrity and authority have been shot to pieces by the cavalier culture in Downing Street during lockdown, with staff blithely flouting rules the rest of us followed diligently.His supporters maintain it is ridiculous to topple a Prime Minister over such trivial matters. But that is not the point. Many of us felt the rules were disproportionate, but we obeyed them because they were the law of the land. We did so under protest but observed them none the less, in some cases even when it meant not being able to say farewell to dying relatives. It is hard to forgive insouciance in high places while there was such misery elsewhere. The law is not just for little people, as some in No 10 appeared to believe.However, the fact that there is now a police probe is not of itself a reason to resign. Tony Blair was interviewed twice in 2007 (though not under caution) in connection with the “cash for honours” scandal. At the time, Labour called it a “passing political hoo-ha”, while the Conservatives demanded Blair’s resignation “in the national interest”. Plus ca change...The parallel with Mr Blair is not an auspicious one for Mr Johnson, as the Labour leader left office a few months later to avoid a leadership challenge. Can the Tories engineer something similar, a deal to let Mr Johnson remain in No 10 before standing down later this year or early next? That would require the Prime Minister to agree and he shows no inclination to do so.Then there is the argument that, with war looming in eastern Europe, now is not the time to defenestrate a Prime Minister. In fact, there is a long history of getting rid of leaders in a time of conflict. Lloyd George replaced Asquith in 1916 and Chamberlain was pushed aside by Churchill in 1940. More recently, in November 1990, thousands of British troops had already been deployed to the Gulf when Mrs Thatcher was forced out by a Cabinet putsch.Mr Johnson seemingly retains the support of his top team – or at least no one has resigned as he did from Theresa May’s Cabinet, precipitating the crisis that led to her downfall. But the big question is this: if he manages to slither out of his immediate predicament, to what purpose? The eminent office he occupies does not exist simply to provide a vehicle for his greater glory. He remains Prime Minister under sufferance of his MPs who expect him to lead a government that is both competent and Conservative.More from NewsPressure on Boris Johnson to release full Sue Gray ‘partygate’ reportCovid rules broken in ‘most homes’, claims MP defending Boris JohnsonDoug Beattie: Ulster Unionist leader to stay despite ‘horrendous and horrific’ tweetsXinjiang is a lovely place with noClimate change threatens to destroy buried treasures, warn expertsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"burns night blunder scottish government makes gaelic translation","story":"Her government spends millions of pounds a year promoting Gaelic and has ensured the language is plastered over everything from emergency vehicles to road signs.But Nicola Sturgeon’s administration was left red-faced on Burns Night after publishing an embarrassing translation error as Scots all over the world gathered to celebrate the country’s national bard.An official Scottish government social media account wished Scots all over the world “Oidhche Losgadh Sona”, in what was supposed to be a translation of “Happy Burns Night” on Tuesday, alongside an image of a traditional supper of haggis, neeps and tatties.However, the patriotic tweet, issued to almost 5,000 followers by the nationalist government’s devolved rural affairs department, backfired when it emerged that “Losgadh” was not Robert Burns’ Gaelic surname but the word for a physical injury caused by heat or chemicals.And while some names do have Gaelic translations, this does not apply to Burns, Gaelic language experts confirmed, and speculated that a hapless official had merely typed the greeting into Google Translate before publishing it to the world.Donald Cameron, a Scottish Conservative MSP for the Highlands and Islands who took his parliamentary oath in Gaelic last May, said: “Whoever was responsible will be sat eating their haggis with a bit of a red face tonight.“It is just as well Burns showed more attention to detail in his works, than this official did in this tweet.”In its most recent budget, the Scottish government committed £25.3 million in taxpayers’ cash to Gaelic learning and a further £3 million to a “Gaelic Capital Fund”. Last year, it published a 48-page Gaelic plan, in which it hailed the language as “an integral part of Scotland’s heritage, national identity and current cultural life”.A devoted Gaelic government agency, Bòrd na Gàidhlig, is based in Inverness and is tasked with overseeing the plan.Among their roles is to advise the Scottish government on “Gaelic issues”.Another of its missions is to “influence national and international events and celebrations… to ensure Gaelic is featured prominently.”However, it appeared that civil servants had failed to consult an expert at the agency, which employs the equivalent of 19 full-time workers. The tweet was swiftly deleted after the error was pointed out by Roger Hutchinson, an author and journalist.He tweeted: “So glad the Scottish government has a salaried Gaelic officer, who trusts Google Translate to know the difference between heat burns (losgadh) and the surname Burns (Burns).”More from NewsPressure on Boris Johnson to release full Sue Gray ‘partygate’ reportCovid rules broken in ‘most homes’, claims MP defending Boris JohnsonDoug Beattie: Ulster Unionist leader to stay despite ‘horrendous and horrific’ tweetsXinjiang is a lovely place with noClimate change threatens to destroy buried treasures, warn expertsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"national insurance rise becoming increasingly indefensible","story":"Cabinet ministers have been out and about presenting a united front in defence of the planned rise in National Insurance contributions. Dominic Raab, the Deputy Prime Minister, said: “I would much rather we didn’t have to do it but given the pandemic and the walloping of the public finances, we do.” The Prime Minister had “grasped the nettle”.Nadhim Zahawi, the Education Secretary, had a similar message. The £12 billion in revenues were essential to fund the NHS and then an overhaul of social care. It was a “big decision” that the Prime Minister had got right, he said.Except that Boris Johnson does not appear to share the commitment of his Cabinet colleagues to this policy. Asked yesterday to guarantee that the tax rise would proceed, he declined to do so. It is emblematic of the incoherence at the top of the Government that senior ministers are being sent out to argue for a policy that seems to be in a state of flux. One reason why Mr Johnson is losing support among his colleagues is because so many have been dispatched by No 10 to defend an approach that has later been jettisoned, occasionally on the same day.If the tax rise is being reconsidered then that is welcome. The revenues are to be spent on an unreformed NHS and it is fanciful to believe they will seamlessly be switched to social care in three years’ time. Opposition to the increase is growing on the backbenches, though it should be noted that only five Tories voted against it when it was put to the Commons in September. More have joined their ranks, realising it will compound an expected cost of living shock in the spring.

A couple of days of the furlough scheme? Another “eat-out-to-help out” week when we all get a half-price pizza? A climate summit or two, or Netflix vouchers for every teenager volunteering to get their seventh Pfizer jab?If it didn’t need to go towards paying down the national debt, the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, may already have been thinking of some eye-catching, focus-group friendly ways in which he could spend the £600 million the Government was awarded by the High Court this week. It’s all thanks to the National Fund, set up in 1928, with an anonymous £500,000 donation, to accept money from wealthy benefactors.The idea was that, via compound interest and new contributions, the National Fund would one day build up into enough money to pay off the debt in full. Now, however, it seems that this objective has been judged so ludicrously far-fetched that it can be put to one side and the Government can have the money.Legally, this is probably right. The National Fund has grown to £600 million. But given that the national debt is now £2.2 trillion, or £72,000 per taxpayer, and is rising at £5,170 per second, even if the whole fund had been put into Apple shares 30 years ago there is no way it was ever going to pay off the vast sums the state has borrowed. And yet morally, the decision was surely a mistake.The fund was a monument to a happier time when we had a better sense of what government borrowing actually meant. It was a reminder that, 90 years ago, people actually trusted that their money would not be wasted by the government – so much so that they were willing to donate more than they owed in tax to an endeavour designed to alleviate the burden on taxpayers. As quaint as the notion might appear to today’s politicians, it also told us that the debt was once seen as deeply embarrassing – taken on to fight the Great War, but that like a mortgage it would need to be paid back one day, and that we might even aspire to run a surplus, and put some money aside for a rainy day (or a pandemic, come to think of it).Perhaps most importantly, the fund was a permanent rebuke to the kind of fashionable economists who argue that more borrowing and more debt is a good thing in itself, irrespective of how wisely the government spends the cash, and that we can keep on printing more money and taking it onto the government’s books forever without any consequences. The anonymous donor in 1928 didn’t believe that, and neither did the other contributors over the years. Their views should carry more weight than they do today.Another £600 million is not going to keep the Chancellor, and even less his free-spending neighbour, going for more than a few days at most. If it could be used for current spending, it would be lost in the accounts.So we should be keeping the money exactly where it is. Even better, we should give it a website and a Twitter feed and open it to fresh donations. Like the calorie counters on restaurant menus, or those flashing signs that tell you are over the speed limit, it would be a gentle reminder that discipline, frugality, and paying your bills on time, are all valuable qualities, and while we may not always live up to those values, we should at least try. If we could re-learn that, it would be £600 million well spent.More from NewsPressure on Boris Johnson to release full Sue Gray ‘partygate’ reportCovid rules broken in ‘most homes’, claims MP defending Boris JohnsonDoug Beattie: Ulster Unionist leader to stay despite ‘horrendous and horrific’ tweetsXinjiang is a lovely place with noClimate change threatens to destroy buried treasures, warn expertsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"thanks keir starmer conservatives ushering new era socialism","story":"A few months ago the suggestion that Keir Starmer was a lucky politician would have produced bucketfuls of scorn. Luck, of course, is a vital element in any politician’s career, but given events since Starmer took over the reins of his party from his predecessor in April 2020, you would be hard pressed to argue that he enjoyed anything other than the bad sort.After a positive start, when voters were simply relieved they no longer had to live with the incessant soap opera of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, Labour’s poll ratings started to slide again, as voters got to know Starmer and decided, on the whole, that they weren’t particularly impressed with him. Last year’s local elections, which coincided with the Hartlepool by-election, was a nadir for him and his party. Starmer’s subsequent performance during the pandemic didn’t help much: the public seemed content to stick with the devil they knew rather than take a chance with the new boy on the block.In the last couple of months everything has changed, mostly for reasons that are nothing to do with Starmer or his front bench’s valiant efforts. Labour’s poll lead, however long it lasts, is wholly down to unforced errors by Johnson and his team. But who cares about that? Certainly not the shadow cabinet, who will accept the fruits of victory however they were won.It may be significant that Johnson’s troubles have largely been caused by his apparent disrespect for anti-Covid rules, including his irresistible urge to attend parties (or work events, depending on the terms of Sue Gray’s final report), and Johnson’s ill-fated attempt to rewrite the rules on House of Commons standards to protect former parliamentary colleague Owen Paterson from censure.Because even before this winter of discontent for the Conservatives, there were siren voices warning that the Johnson government was already straying too far from any known understanding of the word “conservative”. The pandemic changed the political and economic discourse measures such as furlough and a range of business support initiatives, including unexpected billions in public support for the railway and bus companies to see them through a period of historically low passenger numbers, transformed the traditional economic arguments that usually define our politics.It\u0027s certainly true that Labour has been unable, even in these times of staggering levels of public spending, to resist its instinct to demand even more cash from the Treasury. But by the time of the next election, the reliable tactic of pointing the finger at their spendthrift opponents will simply no longer seem a credible tactic for the Conservative Party. Covid has changed much in society but its impact on the political arena goes far beyond arguments over the length of lockdowns or the effectiveness of mask mandates.How does a “small state” party (in name and reputation, at least, if not in practice) resurrect the successful tactic employed in past elections of putting their opponents on the defensive over their spending plans when they themselves have just presided over the largest short-term increase in public spending since World War II?It’s when such questions are asked that you begin to see the tactical wisdom of Labour’s enthusiastic support for multiple lockdowns. Their primary concern, as with the government, was public safety. But for Labour, watching from the side lines as the government borrowed on the never-never and wielded the power of the state to control and direct everyone’s lives, the last two years was as much a confirmation of their political philosophy as it was a repudiation of the Conservatives’. Supporting restrictions was, in essence, a win-win.Unexpectedly, at least for the Right-wing of the Conservative Party, it was not Rishi Sunak’s over-stretched credit card that started to push his party’s fortunes lower in the polls but the personal foibles and judgment of the prime minister. The public seem quite content with a high-spending, high-tax party of government, so long as its leader isn’t seen to be flouting rules on personal behaviour that he himself set.It\u0027s difficult to see how that can be good news for the Conservative Party, or at least for a Conservative Party that claims it wants to recapture the low tax, small government agenda. Labour, on the other hand, would be only too happy to continue what Johnson and Sunak have begun, and they would at least do it enthusiastically and deliberately, rather than with an apologetic wince every time a few billion was committed or a few per cent added to our tax bills.It may be hard to believe, but one day the daily revelations about parties at Number 10 during lockdown will cease and the media caravan will move on. At some point, the forces on both sides of the political ide will have to reassemble on the battlefield and decide what they’re actually fighting about. On public spending, the game has already been partly won by Labour. If there is no counter-attack, a new post-Thatcherite consensus will emerge that will be difficult to challenge. And the only casualty will be the Conservative Party.More from NewsPressure on Boris Johnson to release full Sue Gray ‘partygate’ reportCovid rules broken in ‘most homes’, claims MP defending Boris JohnsonDoug Beattie: Ulster Unionist leader to stay despite ‘horrendous and horrific’ tweetsXinjiang is a lovely place with noClimate change threatens to destroy buried treasures, warn expertsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"traditional phrases sent knackers yard survey finds under 50s","story":"People who pepper their speech with traditional phrases may find they are casting their pearls before swine, after new research found that dozens of sayings are at risk of dying out.Phrases such as “nail your colours to the mast” and “know your onions” were among those barely used by modern speakers, according to the survey of 2,000 adults aged between 18 and 50.Asked if they had ever used dozens of historical phrases, 78 per cent said they had never used the phrase “pearls before swine”, which has its origins in the Bible and was used by both Shakespeare and Dickens. A further 71 per cent had never used “nail your colours to the mast” and 64 per cent “a stitch in time saves nine”.At the less endangered end of the spectrum, 51 per cent of respondents said they had never uttered the phrase “see a man about a dog” and 49 per cent said “snug as a bug in a rug” had never crossed their lips. Not all the at-risk phrases are likely to pass muster among younger generations.

Jealousy and envy were once very distinct words - one could not be jealous of something one did not already possess. Nevertheless, those surveyed expressed disappointment at the disappearance of old sayings, even if they would need to Google them first.

Since the pandemic begun, children have been struggling to maintain a rhythm with their education but it has been hard for many, teachers told the Education Committee.

Now the Mirror has learned the report release date could be this week after allWhitehall enforcer Sue Gray Image: PAByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political EditorDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan | comments Top civil servant Sue Gray has been investigating a string of alleged lockdown-busting parties across Downing Street and Whitehall. But the release date of her report was thrown into chaos today after the Met Police also announced it would investigate “a number of” gatherings to seethey broke the law. Boris Johnson - who has said heaposs willing to be interviewed by police - was told about the development before it was revealed by Scotland Yard’s Commissioner Cressida Dick.At first it seemed Sue Gray’s report could be split in two - one part paused, to let police investigate, and then another part published in truncated form on any parties not probed by police.But the Mirror understands events are moving extremely quickly and the Cabinet Office is now in talks about publishing the entire report, in a matter of days, after all.  Here is what we understand as of the afternoon of Tuesday  January….What is the Sue Gray report Top civil servant Sue Gray is investigating a string of parties in Whitehall between May  and April  - mostly in  Downing Street and its garden.The -year-old took over the inquiry from Cabinet Secretary Simon Case after it emerged a party had been held in his own office. Her inquiry has been set up to get “a general understanding of the nature of the gatherings”. That means saying who attended, the “setting and the purpose”, and “reference to adherence to the guidance in place at the time”. But its remit does not include saying whether the PM broke the lawor the Ministerial Code . When is the Sue Gray report due Sue Gray had been due to publish a report this week on what she found.But that nowmighthave been scuppered by the Met Police announcing it is also investigating a number of the parties from  .Sue Gray’s terms of reference said: “If during the course of the work any evidence emerges of behaviour that is potentially a criminal offence, the matter will be referred to the police and the Cabinet Office’s work may be paused.” However - the Mirror understands the Cabinet Office is still discussing what,anything, will be paused, and there are several possible outcomes.Will the Sue Gray report be split into two parts We thought it would be, but thataposs now looking less likely.Essentially, as of this lunchtime, No thought Sue Gray would only be able to carry on investigating - and publish a report on - any party that police werenotinvestigating. She would have to “pause” work on any party that policewereinvestigating.This would essentially split her report into two - one report due imminently, and one report that could be weeks or months away depending on when Scotland Yard finish. The Prime Ministeraposs spokesman said No wonapost publish anything that relates to the work of the police, but can continue to work on allegations that do not reach the police threshold. However…. it looks like this has already changed since the No briefing at .am. Why might the Sue Gray report be published in full after all The Mirror understands the situation is now moving fast after today’s police announcement. Since the No briefing this lunchtime, sources in Scotland Yard said the force would, in fact, not object to the publishing of Sue Gray’s report. While there is always the possibility of a police investigation being pre-empted, police are more relaxed because they have obtained much of their information from Sue Gray herself. And crucially the penalty for breaching lockdown rules is a fixed penalty notice, which means it’s highly unlikely to prejudice a jury. Human rights barrister Adam Wagner said he saw no legal reason why Sue Gray’s report should not be published. It’s understood the Cabinet Office have been in talks with the police to work out whether Scotland Yard is, indeed, happy to have a full report out in the public domain. A government source said these talks will “go a long way” to helping Sue Gray’s team decide what can be published. The Times reported that Scotland Yard had given the green light for publication as of pm on Tuesday.So when will the report release date actually be The situation is very fluid, but the Mirror has been told despite all the drama, Sue Gray’s report - either the full thing or a truncated version- could be published as soon as tomorrow. A government source said No getting hold of the report could happen as quickly as today.If so, the report could be published on Wednesday just before PMQs.What does it all mean for Boris Johnson The timing and nature of the report is crucial for Boris Johnson because it could affect his own MPs trying to topple him as Prime Minister.  Tory MPs need to send no confidence letters to trigger a leadership challenge, and many were waiting for the outcome of Sue Gray’s report before deciding whether to send a letter. A partial report would mean Tory MPs were hamstrung on whether or not to vote no confidence in their leader. But a full report would mean they could safely reach a conclusion on whether he should be ousted. One Tory elected in  told the Mirror things had “quietened down in the past week”, adding: “Sometimes you get to the precipice, look over and go ‘aagh!’. “Most of the Tory MPs Iaposve spoken to in the last few days seem to think he will get through it.” But they warned: “People are not so much waiting for the Sue Gray report as for how the Prime Minister responds afterwards.”What  could happen Some lawyers have questioned whether the incidents may be examples of malfeasance or misconduct in public office or neglect of duty. If police consider such offences that could lead to a prosecution on more serious charges which may result in a prison sentence. There is also speculation over whether the probe could open the door to possible action for perverting the course of justice,officers discover those involved lied or tried to conceal evidence.

Boris Johnson is forcing people to pay for his career with their health and, inevitably, in some cases their lives. To please his right-wingers and try to cling to power he’s dropping most Covid restrictions from tomorrow, to the alarm of the scientic and medical communities.Even isolation after a positive test will apparently be scrapped by March. It’s unlikely this government will bring back restrictions ever again, no matter what. The best thing we can do to protect ourselves is get vaccinated and boosted. Then your chances of catching Covid are reduced, but evenyou do, you’re much less likely be seriously ill, or – crucially for society – to spread it to others.  “If everyone who was offered a vaccine and booster would take it, the pandemic would be effectively over in richer countries,” claries the consistently reliable Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh. Getting vaccinated is good for us personally, and for everyone  too. It is the very clear way out. What’s not to love  The Get Boosted campaign was a start, but now it needs to go a stage further. The vaccine hesitant – those who are afraid, because they’ve genuinely fallen for untrue propaganda – need to be persuaded. The ­militant, rabid anti-vaxxers will never be persuaded, so they need to be forced. No excuses. Too many people who happily put meals containing who-knows-what chemicals into their bodies, or those who ingest recreational drugs cut with let’s-not-even-go-there have said they won’t have the jab because they don’t know what’s in it. Unless you’re a food chemist or a drug dealer, no one knows what’s in anything! The vaccine has been tested and proven. Get jabbed, or . French President Emmanuel Macron ’s strategy is to “p*** off” the unvaccinated by making daily le more and more dficult for them. Tres bien, but not far enough. The unvaccinated must become social pariahs. They shouldn’t be allowed into indoor communal spaces like restaurants, cinemas, shops, gigs and – yup, the most bitter of all blows – pubs.Why should those of us who are jabbed and boosted have to risk breathing in their maskless air  If they don’t like it, they know exactly what they can do about it. Perhaps we should even make unvaccinated patients pay for the NHS care they are statistically so much more likely to need after refusing their jabs  Maybe the money should go directly into the pockets of the exhausted doctors and nurses who will have to treat them, seeing as they’ve unnecessarily added to their back-breaking workload. This tough love, cruel-to-be-kind tactic really is our only option now. We’ve tried personal responsibility, arguing and attempting to reason with brainwashed Facebookers. Enough. Get jabbed, or .

A Kirklees Council spokesperson told : “Tackling rough sleeping is one of the Council’s key priorities. We have a rough sleeping team dedicated to working with those in urgent need of help, including offering temporary accommodation where appropriate, but this offer is not always taken-up for ious reasons.“It is not always possible to house dogs in temporary accommodation, but we always work to find temporary foster care for pets whilst their owners await permanent re-housing.“In this case, both services were offered whilst the couple were being matched to a suitable property.“A long-term home has now been found and, once the property has undergone repairs, will be ready for them to view.”Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON David ThompsonCare homesMental healthNursing homesAnimalsADHDTown Council\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Emily Ross ordered a -inch barbecue chicken pizza and a kebab from Pasha Pizza in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, while walking home from a night out on Saturday. The -year-old said she intended to pay by cash but instead fell asleep at the top of the stairs before the pizza arrived at around .am and did not hear the driver knocking. The following morning, Emily claims she picked up her phone to call the takeaway and offer to pay but instead found the angry -second voicemail berating her for not answering the door. Pasha Pizza confirmed one of their drivers had left the potty-mouthed voicemail and has since been sacked. Emily said: I was passed out at the top of the stairs and I didnapost hear him knock or my phone ring. I donapost even remember calling and making the order. I donapost know how I even got a sentence out. I was devastated when I realised Iaposd missed him. I was starving. Emily, from Sunderland, said she found the incident funny and admitted she opted not to pay once she discovered the expletive-laden rant. She added: When I got up and listened to the voicemail, I just thought aposwhat on earth apos I was laughing. Luckily I found it funny and it didnapost bother me. Iaposve never heard anything like it before. I was going to ring up and pay because I would never normally do that, it must be awful when people donapost pay. If I ran a takeaway, Iaposd be frustratedthat happened because I bet they lose a lot of money. But I thought that surely I couldnapost then ring up and say Iaposve called to pay but Iaposve received that voicemail. The potty-mouthed driver left a voicemail saying this is Pasha Pizza. Youaposre not answering your f*g motherf*g phone. Do not call my shop any more b*d stupid f****r. Luckily, the stay-at-home mum of one saw the funny side of the shocking rant and posted the recording on social media where itaposs racked up , shares. Emily said: Iaposve never ordered from there before and Iaposd been looking forward to it. I normally pay by bank card but I was going to pay in cash which is probably why he was raging. It must be awful when people order and donapost answer the phone. Pasha Pizza confirmed the business is aware of the presence of the voicemail online.A spokesperson said: Unfortunately this was our driver and he has since been fired. This is not how we would operate no matter the circumstances. The lady in question called the shop at .am on January , ,  minutes after closing hours and begged us to take her order. We kindly agreed and kept five of our staff members working after they were ready to go home, we switched the equipment back on and made her order. However, when our driver arrived at her home there were people inside the home and he could hear them clearly laughing. He kept knocking but no one answered the door. He then came back to the store and was instructed to call the customer again just in case they had given the wrong address, again there was no answer. This went on with the shop trying to contact her until :am. The driver then lost his temper and unfortunately left an angry voicemail. The restaurant also explained that since the foul-mouthed rant went viral, it has been inundated with abuse from people who saw the clip online. The spokesperson said: Since this incident we have been subjected to over  harassment calls to the shop. We have also had people voicing that they know where the owner lives and even had one person send messages and make threats that he was going to come to the owneraposs home and even stated the name of the owneraposs next-door neighbour. Due to all of this we have had to contact the police who are now dealing with this situation due to the harassment and threats being made. Northumbria Police have been contacted for comment.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Northumbria PoliceViralPizzaTakeaways\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Drivers are likely to face fines and points on their licencethey fail to adhere to the amended rules, which are being implemented across the UK.Department for Transport is enforcing a new aposhierarchy of road usersapos from Saturday January , . It will ensure that pedestrians and cyclists face greater protection on roads and at crossings.The new guidelines are split into three categories, all with a focus on making roads safer for non-drivers. So, hereaposs everything you need to watch out for with the brand new Highway Code rules. What are the new Highway Code  rules  Rule H Hierarchy of Road Users  The Hierarchy of Road Users is the main focus of the Highway Code  rule update and the concept centres around protecting those most at riska road collision occurs. Pedestrians have been identied as the most vulnerable group, leading to their place being at the top of the new structure.The Highway Code outlines that cyclists, horse riders and motorcyclists are also part of this group. It also highlights children, older adults and disabled people being more at risk.Therefore, the new hierarchy structure will lead to road users - who have the ability to cause the most harm during collisions - having the greatest responsibility to keep other road users safe.  In particular, the guidelines state that drivers of a selection of vehicles will be facing the most scrutiny on the roads. It states: This principle applies most strongly to drivers of large goods and passenger vehicles, vans minibuses, cars taxis and motorcycles.A Department for Transport spokesperson told The Mirror: The Department has established a working group of key organisations to ensure that messages about the changes are as widespread as possible. And our well-established THINK! campaign will continue to ensure all road users are aware both when these changes come into effect and beyond. Rule H Pedestrian priority  The  Highway Code update has outlined that drivers, cyclists. drivers, motorcyclists, horse-drawn vehicles and horse riders must now give way to pedestrians who are crossing or waiting to cross the road, at junctions into which or from which you are turning. Previously, vehicles and cyclists were given priority at junctions, but the rules now mean that this is no longer the case. Pedestrians continue to have priority at zebra crossings, and vehicles must give way to cyclists and pedestrians at parallel crossings. Cyclists and drivers must also give way to pedestrians at light-controlled crossings when the green signal appears. Another rule update now means that cyclists need to give way to pedestrians on shared-use cycle tracks. Rule H Cyclist safety  From giving way at roundabouts to overtaking cyclists, a number of rules have been amended to improve cyclist safety as part of the hierarchy restructure. Drivers across the UK are now advised not to cut across cyclists, horse riders or horse-drawn vehicles when turning in or out of junctions, or changing lanes. In a huge shakeup to the rules, the  guideline amends also mean drivers must now give cyclists priority at roundabouts under Rule . It now states: You should give priority to cyclists on the roundabout. They will be travelling more slowly than motorised traffic.  Give them plenty of room and do not attempt to overtake them within their lane. Allow them to move across your path as they travel around the roundabout. Cyclists must, however, stay in the left-hand lane, while signalling right to ensure they alert driversthey arenapost leaving the roundabout at the next turning. All the other  Highway Code rule updates you need to know Overtaking other road users While previous guidance stated drivers needed to give cyclists aposas much room as possibleapos when overtaking, Rule  has now been updated.  The guidance is now as follows: Leave at least . metres when overtaking cyclists at speeds of up to mph. Give them more space when overtaking at higher speeds. When it comes to horse riders and horse-drawn vehicles, drivers must now not exceed speeds of mph and there should be at least two metres of space. Drivers should also leave a minimum of two metres of space when passing a pedestrian who is walking on the road. Cyclist road positioning  Cyclists may now drive in the middle of a lane, in order to make themselves as visible as possible. However, they are to move to the left of the laneit is safe and the following applies:Cyclists are on a quiet road or street and a faster vehicle approaches Cyclists are in slower-moving traffic that then speeds up, in order to allow for faster vehicles overtaking Cyclists are in an area of a junction where it would be unsafe for drivers to overtake youTurning Left Rule , which previously advised cyclists to keep an eye out for vehicles turning left ahead at a Í›, has now become Rule .  The rule entails cyclists looking out for other cyclists or motorcyclists around them before signalling. They are also encouraged to avoid riding on the inside of vehicles slowing down to turn left or indicating that they are turning left. The new guidance adds: If you are turning right, check the traffic to ensure it is safe, then signal and move to the centre of the road. Wait until there is a safe gap in the oncoming traffic and give a final look before completing the turn. It may be safer to wait on the left until there is a safe gap or to dismount and push your cycle across the road.  This amendment also highlights the importance of Rule H, and says that cyclists must give way to pedestrians crossing or waiting to cross now. Opening the door A brand new addition to Rule  is new guidance to open your car door in a way that allows you to check for others, highlighted in the new hierarchy, who may be passing.The update reads: Where you are able to do so, you should open the door using your hand on the opposite side to the door you are opening. For example, use your left hand to open a door on your right-hand side. This will make you turn your head to look over your shoulder. Passengers in cars are also instructed to look all around, using their mirrors, before opening the door of their vehicle.

The Primrose Court estate in Huyton, Liverpool, made headlines after a video taken three years ago, describing it as a apossh*tholeapos was posted to Tiktok last week and viewed over  million times. Today little has changed from the scenes in the video, which show windows and doors smashed in or boarded up, burned out houses with the roof missing and enormous piles of trash - some of which has allegedly been there for years. The estate is considered unadopted land by Knowsley Council who say they canapost afford to step in, after developers failed to finish construction of the road and street lighting after they went bust in . Now residents, who are forced to provide their own street lights, have accused the council of being too scared to step in because of trouble from outsiders, who relentlessly fly-tip the street.  One resident who has lived on Primrose Court for four years with his young daughter said outsiders prey on the unadopted street - knowing that without council supervision there will unlikely be consequences for their crimes. He said: “The smashed out windows and burned down houses have been there for years. Itaposs outsiders coming in dumping their rubbish, setting fires in the street and fighting. “If you come again next week it won’t look like this because we’ll have all pitched together to clean it up, but it won’t be long before they come back and dump more rubbish. “Some of the rubbish has been here for years. I think the council needs to do something because that’s the real problem. Nobody owns the street. “Of course it bothers the residents, we don’t want to come out and look at the street like that or come out and see mess everywhere.  But Knowsley Councillor Ken McGlashon claims the problems lie with the landlord who he says told the council and Primrose Court residents at a meeting we treat you like s**t because you live in a s**thole. He claims the council has suffered a £ million cut to its budget by the government leaving it unable to pick up the bill to fix the estate after the developer failed to hold up their end of the deal. Coun McGlashon said: It’s not a council matter because we don’t own the property.  “It must be horrible for the poor people, I feel sorry for them but what the hell can you dothe developer doesn’t do their job and the council can’t afford to pick up the bill. “This is a quote from the landlord when we met with them “we treat you like s**t because you live in a s**thole”. Thataposs the quote from the landlords themselves. But the majority landlord of Primrose Court has furiously refuted the claim adding that the council has refused to help and is even asking residents for council tax - despite having no involvement in the estate’s maintenance.  Colin Bell, managing director of A Properties, is the acting landlord of  properties in the close, which has  houses in total. Seven of those are derelict and the remaining five others are privately owned. Mr Bell claims that at a meeting with the council in September , council workers agreed that they would initially cover a £, bill to finish the street lights and road, the cost of which would have been repaid by A Properties in full over - years. But he adds that since that meeting, nothing has been done. Mr Bell said: We have over  house and  per cent of our problems come from Primrose Court. We were quoted £, over two and half years ago to put the lighting in and do the road which would have made all the dference.  “The council are saying they can’t afford it but they’re wrong, we were going to pay the council back for those works. I don’t know how a council can’t find £,. Dismissing the councillor’s claims that he ever described the tenants as ‘s**t’, Mr Bell said: “That is an absolute load of rubbish, we are the only landlord there and I certainly havenapost had any meeting with any councillor and said our tenants are s**t. “I think the council has every right to take over those properties and I don’t know why they haven’t done it because they’re short of properties to rent out, they have people on the housing waiting list, and they have these properties that they could have easily taken over… but they haven’t done it.” A Knowsley Council spokesperson said: “Knowsley Council did not build the properties at Primrose Court and has never owned them. All of the properties are privately owned. “Many of the issues at Primrose Court arise because the development was built by two separate privately owned companies – both of which went into liquidation without completing the work on site and without meeting the planning conditions for the developments. This meant that the usual processes for adopting the highway, installing street lighting etc could not be followed. The current property owners appear to be expecting the Council to use a considerable amount of public money to complete a privately owned development. “The Council has been in regular dialogue with the homeowners and landlords of properties in Primrose Court since initial issues arose in the area. A number of Council services, including Housing, Highways, Environmental Health, and Crime  Communities, have worked with homeowners and landlords to identy solutions to the issues on site, try to identy sources of funding, and agree a collaborative approach to tackling the issues that are evident. “For example, the Council met with some of the owners to discuss co-funding highways and infrastructure improvements to bring the road up to adoptable standards. At that meeting, the owners who attended agreed - in principle - to co-fund this work. Unfortunately, some of the other owners who did not attend that meeting subsequently refused to agree to contribute their shares, which would be required to progress the adoption of the road under a Private Streetworks Agreement. The Council has established how much the work would cost should an agreement ever be reached, but these costs are only going to continue to increase as time passes due to the poor original construction of the road by the developers. “Unfortunately, the Council is not in a position itself to fund all of the work which is required on site. Over a ten-year period, the Knowsley Council has been one of the hardest hit local authorities in the country by Government funding cuts – the Council’s budget has been cut by % and it has had to find £m worth of savings. Funding works to a privately-owned development would not be appropriate, particularly in that context. “In response to the specic comments made by Mr Bell of A Properties, the Council has never agreed to temporarily cover the cost of street lighting or highways works. We have offered to provide support in other ways such as advising on the specication of materials and construction methods, but we have never agreed to cover the cost of the works, temporarily or otherwise. The suggestion that the Council is “too scared” to finish the street lighting is completely untrue – We have simply never agreed to do that work. Council services regularly visit Primrose Court to provide a range of services, such as waste collections, social care, education, housing support, street scene, and environmental health. Our Crime and Communities team has secured funding to install CCTV, once other improvement works have been completed. Just like anybody  in Knowsley, residents pay Council Tax because they access a very wide range of Council services. The dference for residents in Primrose Court is that they have bought or rented houses in a development which was never finished. “We take action against any reported incidents of fly tipping including removal of rubbish and working with our partners and the local community to identy those responsible and pursue enforcement action. In addition, Merseyside Police continue to patrol the area and has conducted a number of search warrants. “Despite the very clear challenges, we continue to look at solutions to tackle the issues being experienced. The standards at Primrose Court are not acceptable and we remain committed to working with the owners on collaborative solutions to resolve the issues for all concerned.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Council taxHousingKnowsley CouncilCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

So itaposs no surprise that when one fan was luckily enough to meet Kate on a recent engagement, she was able to ask for some inside info on the beautul tan boots she was wearing.However, when she asked the royal where sheaposd purchased the boots from, Kate gave a rather surprising answer.The exchange was caught on camera last week when Kate and husband Prince William visited Lancashire and paid a visit to Church on the Street in Burnley - a centre that helps people struggling with poverty, homelessness, addiction and other problems. There they met with Trudi and Alastair Barrie, who work at the centre, with Kate even cradling their young baby daughter Anastasia. As Kate cuddled the baby, Trudi can be heard asking: Where are your boots from, madam  Kate doesnapost immediately reply and appears to be distracted by a joke made by William.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

Itaposs unclear which brand the boots are from - although some royal fashion fans have speculated they could be from YSL. For the visit, Kate also wore a recycled £ Massimo Dutti that sheaposs been spotted wearing at two other engagements.  She teamed the coat with a gorgeous camel polo neck jumper and matching skirt.Meanwhile, at the same visit, William playfully ruled out having a fourth child as Kate cuddled baby Anastasia. The royal couple are already parents to Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.As Kate cooed over the little girl, those around couldnapost help but say aww and William, looking at his we gazing at the baby, joked: Donapost give her any ideas, to laughter. He then told his smiling we: You canapost take her with you! However, itaposs not the first time that the couple has appeared to rule out baby number four - despite Kateaposs obvious love for children.In , on a visit to Northern Ireland, Kate met a five-month-old baby and admitted that it made her feel broody.When the babyaposs father cheekily asked: Baby number four  Kate joked: I think William would be a little worried.

Tragic six-year-old Rikki was strangled and posed naked in a star shape in woodland near his home in Peterborough in November . His mum Ruth Neave was originally accused of his murder but cleared after a trial. The case remained unsolved for more than  years before a cold case review allegedly led to a breakthrough. The DNA of James Watson, who was  at the time of the killing, was found on Rikkiaposs clothes which had been dumped in a wheelie bin, jurors heard. On Tuesday, a former friend of Ms Neave was called to give evidence at Watsonaposs murder trial at the Old Bailey.  Asked to describe her emotional state, Martin Reed said: At the time, she was very, very upset but she swung from moody to angry to tearful. It was just a wide range of emotions. When asked what she was angry about, Mr Reed replied: The fact that it actually happened, that her little boy had been taken. The witness, who gave evidence by video link, said he had not seen Ms Neave since the day of her arrest. He was also askedhe was aware that Ms Neave had an interest in the occult and witchcraft. I knew she had an interest in it ever since I have known her, Mr Reed said.  She was talking about Tarot and dferent things like that. Itaposs all vague recollection. I cannot really remember anything specic. He was then asked said: Were you aware Ruth Neave had written a book, or started a book, about the perfect murder  The witness replied: No, this is the first I have heard about it. The defence barrister went on: Were you aware that she had a great deal of books and magazines at her house about murder and unsolved crimes  Mr Reed replied: I knew she had an interest in murders and unsolved crime, yes, because of the books,theories on certain cases which she discussed. Prosecutors previously asserted that the mum was wrongly accused of involvement in her sonaposs death, with evidence showing she could not have been responsible. Other witnesses have described seeing Watson with Rikki on the Welland Estate in Peterborough on the morning of his disappearance.

Omicron is believed to be more transmissible than the previous Delta iant, but infection appears to be milder, similar to that of a cold. Now a ‘stealth’ version of the Omicron iant has appeared, leading to fears it could spark further waves of Covid- in the future.The strain, named as Omicron BA., has been classied as a “iant under investigation” by the UKHSA, but there are still huge gaps in our knowledge about the iant. It’s important to be aware of the symptoms of Omicron to avoid further spread of infection.  Here we take a look at some of the lesser known symptoms to look out for. What are the symptoms of Omicron The main symptoms of coronavirus are a new, continuous cough, a fever and a loss of taste and or smell, according to the NHS.However, symptoms of the Omicron iant have been described as milder.According to the ZOE Covid Study, the top five symptoms identied were a runny nose, headache, fatigue, sneezing and a sore throat.There are also other sign to look out for – particularly ones that affect your ears, eyes and head. Vertigo is a symptom that can occur during the “acute” phase of Covid infection, during the recovery process or as part of long Covid symptoms, says the NHS. Vertigo is a sensation of spinning or an altered sense of motion, or lightheadedness.The NHS adds: “Dizziness can also be linked with ringing in the ears, reduced hearing, eye strain and headaches.“These may come and go throughout the day. If they are constant or very intense, you should inform your healthcare professional as they may want to do some further investigations.”  According to the NHS, many studies have shown that Covid may cause headaches. It added: “Some people even get a headache before they notice any breathing problems. It is a common symptom of Covid. “Headaches are often a feature of other viral infections, but for most people the presence of a headache does not always mean that the virus is still present in the body.” According to Dr Konstantina Stankovic, chair of the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at Stanford University, ear pain is becoming a common sign of infection. Brits will be well aware of the three main symptoms of coronavirus – a new, continuous cough, a fever and a loss of taste and or smell. These are the officially recognised symptoms according to the NHS. However, with the new Omicron iant, symptoms have been described as being more similar to a common cold.

Covid absence figures for pupils are the worst they have been this academic year, he added. Mr Whiteman said schools are struggling to keep things running, with nearly % of their staff off on average. But for some this is much higher, he said. Our members are repeatedly telling us that they are having to drop everything to find cover and that just keeping things going is a challenge. He said headteachers are still very much in the eye of the Covid storm and that the disruption is causing huge pressure for pupils preparing to sit exams.  On Tuesday, the NAHT called on the Government to review the changes made to GCSEs and A levels this year to mitigate disruptions caused by Covid. Currently, pupils in England will be offered a choice of topics in some GCSE exams, such as English literature, history, ancient history and geography, as well as exam aids next summer to make up for Covid-related disruption. For subjects where a choice of topics is not provided, advance notice on the focus of exams will be released on February  to help with revision. But the NAHT union said the Government needed to review its plans to make sure exams are fair for this yearaposs GCSE and A level cohort. Advance notice information should be published as soon as possible, Sarah Hannafin, the NAHTaposs senior policy advisor, said.

He said: “I had this one person saying ‘Your boy is unhealthy at that size’ and things like that. He was saying it was unfair.”  Alfie had been going to kids’ classes at the gym Mark attends and walking places rather than getting lts. Upset Mark tweeted: “Had to remove a post from Facebook as an idiot commented saying my boy is too ‘big’ to play under s and isn’t healthy.

Dad-of-two Dr Gary Jenkins, , sustained le-threatening injuries in an incident in Bute Park in the early hours of Tuesday, July  last year.Dr Jenkins, who was described as a loving father, husband and brother in a statement issued by his family following his death, subsequently died of a severe brain injury at the University Hospital of Wales two weeks later. Jason Edwards, , and Lee William Strickland, , both from Cardf, and a -year-old girl who cannot be named for legal reasons, are on trial at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court, where they have all denied murder charges.The teen has been described as “evil and sadistic” by a witness for her part in the attack, which was thought to have been a homophobic attack on Dr Jenkins, who was reportedly bisexual, Sun Online reports Edwards, of Litchfield Court, Riverside, Strickland, of no fixed abode, and the youth have each admitted charges of manslaughter, robbery of a bag, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Prosecutor Dafydd Enoch, opening the case on Tuesday, said the killing was motivated by greed, homophobia, and a straightforward liking for violence. He told the jury: “The man at the centre of this case encountered the worst traits of humankind and despite the best efforts of one person he could not find the protection.” Mr Enoch added: “Dr Gary Jenkins was a -year-old consultant psychologist living and working in Cardf. “On July  last year in the early hours of the morning was in Bute Park in Cardf where he was viciously beaten, robbed, tortured and left for dead by these three defendants in the dock.  “It was a beating apparently motivated by greed, homophobia, and a straightforward liking of violence. All three defendants accept that they all were present when Dr Jenkins was attacked.” He said: “The chilling attack was recorded by a nearby CCTV camera and she can be heard shouting “money” at the top of her voice”. She calls Dr Jenkins ious names, Mr Enoch said, as Edwards could be heard saying: “Stamp his head, stamp his head.” Dr Jenkins could be heard in the CCTV footage pleading with the trio over and over until he could no longer speak, Mr Enoch said. Heavy blows could be heard being delivered to Mr Jenkins, before the girls was heard to say “Yeah, I needed that”. Mr Enoch rebuffed the girl’s claims that she only joined in the attack “half-heartedly” because she was scared of the two older men, saying she was “no wilting flower caught up in something that was not of her making.  “The reality is a million miles from that scenario,” he said. “For her to have acted in that way she must be a very troubled young woman. “She was loud and confident and was laughing during the attack. It was torture, pure and simple. “When witness Lewis Williams fought back to stop the attack she said: “I’m a girl” asshe was the victim. “But she is no ordinary -year-old and Mr Williams described her as “f*****g evil and sadistic”. Addressing the jury  prior to selection, Judge Daniel Williams told them about the case. He said: The defendants are charged with the murder of Gary Jenkins who died following an incident which took place on July  last year in Bute Park in the centre of Cardf.  The prosecutionaposs case is defendants were involved in robbing Gary Jenkins of a bag he was carrying and the three subjected him to a very severe assault from which he was eventually to die  days later. “The prosecutionaposs case is they assaulted a witness who tried to step in. This area of Bute Park is, the prosecution say, known for being an area where gay men have sex. The prosecution say the assault of Gary Jenkins was in some measure homophobic. The allegation of murder is denied. Mr Enoch said the teenage girl had met Edwards and Strickland for the first time on July , when the trio went to the park with the plan to rob a gay man. “They knew what went on in the park late at night and the vulnerable nature of the people who frequented that area,” he said. The group happened across Dr Jenkins, who lived alone in Cardf after separating from his we six years earlier. His we is following the evidence through a video link to the court. Dr Jenkins suffered several bleeds to the brain as a result of the attack, as well as a fractured jaw, a broken nose, swelling to the skull and multiple rib fractures. According to the prosecution, none of the defendants showed a “scintilla” of remorse after the doctor died. The case, which is expected to last four weeks and is being heard in front of Judge Daniel Williams, continues.

Council leader Mike Bird said some staff had already been spoken about how the presented themselves in online meetings. He also said some of the staff dressed casually were senior officers. HR bosses they were looking at drawing up guidelines which require employees to be more suitably dressed in business attire in future meetings.The issue was raised at Mondayaposs meeting during a discussion on Walsall Councilaposs refreshed code of conduct, which was approved by members of the committee, reports Birmingham Live.  Councillor Towe said: Iaposm a bit pedantic on how people dress. In many a Teams meeting when people have been at home, I think people are dressed inappropriately. You know,T-shirts where senior people are in meetings. I wonder who judges what is appropriate and what staff should be wearing when they are on a Teams meeting when you could have some signicant people there. Councillor Bird added: I think there is a very good point there. Iaposve seen this on Teams.  When weaposve got people representing this council and they are the front face of the council. I know there are guidelines and people have been pulled up over their dress code. There are some Iaposve seen - some senior people I have to say - who could be dressed a little more appropriately.

Despite settled conditions in coming days, Brits should be careful not to get lulled into a  sense of security with snow possible in seven days time despite bright clear skies before that. However, any cold snap is expected to be brief.James Madden, forecaster for Exacta Weather, told the Express: “We are expecting to see some changes as we head into the final month of the winter.“Cold and snow will encroach from the north during the early part of February, and some of these wintry downpours may reach as far south as central England and the capital.  “The good news for snow-haters is that these blasts may only be brief as the mild weather from the Atlantic pushes across the UK. “A north-south ide will also bring the worst of the weather to Scotland and northern England with southern Britain likely to dodge the worst of the weather.” Britain is currently being straddled by a huge region of high pressure. This is keeping the snow, wind and rain at bay whilst temperatures still plummet despite the clear skies.  The high pressure will hold on through next week until it finally breaks and gives way to winter winds from the north. Models show these Artic blasts sweeping across the home nations, driven by a huge bloc of low pressure near Greenland. Mr Madden added: “This winter has so far been dominated by high pressure resulting in little in the way of cold spells and widespread snow. “However, February certainly looks like more topsy-turvy with the weather flipping between cold and mild.” The calm, but cold weather will continue for a week apart from the odd wintry shower across Scotland or the north of England. It will see out what remains of January. Netweather forecaster Ian Simpson however said snow was even further off and that January’s high pressure would last into the early days of the next month.  He said: “High pressure is still dominating the weather, and it doesnapost look set to move very far anytime soon ‑ even at  days out, most of the forecast models still have high pressure very close to or on top of the British Isles. “The weekend looks set to be mainly dry and cloudy, with westerly winds bringing plenty of cloud and moisture into our area of high pressure. “Next week will continue with high pressure, and with high pressure mostly centred over the south of Britain, there will be some sunny spells to the east of high ground and over the south of England, but Northern Ireland, western Scotland and north-west England, will generally be cloudy.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON SnowWeather\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Image: HNP Picture Desk Hyde News  Pictures LtdByAbigail OLearyNews Reporter:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan | comments A woman has launched a £, legal battle to win the right to get pregnant using her dead fianceaposs sperm.Ellie Home was devastated four months ago when she lost her partner Myles to pneumonia after a y battle with leukemia.However the couple, who had been together for three years, had already started having IVF treatment to try to have a baby.The -year-old partner now wants to continue that treatment so that she can have the child she and Myles had dreamed of. Speaking at her home in Milton Keynes, Bucks., Ellie said: Before Myles started his treatment, he was askedwe wanted some of his semen to be frozen and stored in case he ever wanted to start a family.He said yes, of course. Having children together was something we had always planned and dreamed of. So there are nine vials in storage with the NHS, waiting to be used.I had started the initial consultations with an IVF clinic and the plan was for me to get pregnant as soon as possible. Tragically, Mylesapos health declined rapidly last year after he suffered a series of infections. However, his death in September was still sudden and unexpected according to Ellie, who has taken his last name, despite the pandemic preventing their marriage. Unfortunately, during the build-up to Mylesapos death, neither the doctors nor any hospital officials mentioned his frozen sperm. Ellie explained: As the law stands, he needed to sign a consent form for me to use his sperm after he passed away. Nobody told us this. We had no idea. Had we known, he would most definitely have signed. We had talked so much about the baby we wanted to have. If it was a boy we planned to call him Mylo, after Myles. If itaposs a girl we wanted to call her Nora, after my nan. We talked about how the child would be into Star Wars and geeky things, just like their dad....death was something that was never anticipated. As Myles did not give explicit consent, Ellie has no legal right to use the frozen sperm for IVF treatment, meaning she will have to fight an uphill legal battle that will cost her up to £,. Ellie has the support of Mylesapos family and is able to support herself and the child. Even so, lawyers have given Ellie only a   chance of winning her case and she has already spent all her funds in her fight. Now she has turned to the public and has set up a GoFundMe page in order to try and raise the funds for her court battle. She said: I am now facing a very long and costly court case to win legality over Mylesapos stored semen, something that should rightly be mine. Not only have I lost the love of my le the man who I built a le with, planned to marry and carry his children but I am on the brink of losing the chance to ever even have our children. We all feel it would be a little bit of Myles that we still have. The child would be loved and cherished. I am desperately in need of raising the funds now, at this point. I have so far used all of our savings that Myles had left to me, the money we had aside to build our future with, to use for our children. Thank you to everyone who has been sharing and donating. You will never know how much it means to us. These past few days I have been completely and solely occupied with gathering up every single piece of evidence to show how much me and Myles wanted children, and how we were already involved in the early stages of IVF.

Natasha Palmer, , suffered a brain injury after a drink-driver smashed into the back of her Renault Clio at high speed on the M in . She was left disabled and unable to work due to severe migraines, poor memory and concentration, light sensitivity and anxiety, as well as dizziness that she described to a doctor as making her walk like she was drunk. But after she sued the other driver Sefer Mantas, his insurance company accused her of fundamental dishonesty and exaggerating her problems.Lawyers for Liverpool Victoria Insurance Company Ltd put in excess of seven hundred pages of social media posts loaded by the claimant on her Instagram account before the High Court.They claimed the posts, which showed her enjoying holidays skiing and in India, attending music events and completing sporting challenges including a km Bear Grylls obstacle run, proved she had been lying about the effects of the crash.  But Judge Anthony Metzer QC has now awarded her a massive compensation payout after accepting that her Instagram posts did not present a complete picture, as she would tend to put a positive gloss on how she was doing as she wished to obtain more aposlikesapos. Social media tends to paint a glossy picture of the posteraposs le, he commented, handing her £,, in damages. The court heard that Ms Palmer suffered brain damage as well as damage to her neck, chest, back and ribs. it was said she was left with a disjointed memory after the accident while her car, which had been an th birthday gt, was a write-off. Sefer Mantas was later convicted of drink-driving. Lawyers for Liverpool Victoria Insurance Company Ltd accepted liability but hotly disputed the extent of the injuries claimed by Ms Palmer, accusing her of fundamental dishonesty in exaggerating her case. Although she claimed damages of over £m for injuries which she said wrecked her career, defence lawyers said her case was worth just £,.  Ms Palmer, a once super-fit athlete and skier, faced claims that she had lied about the impact of the accident on her le and that her Instagram posts proved it. The insureraposs barrister Charles Woodhouse claimed her posts showed Ms Palmer had taken part in much more signicant physical exercise than she admits in her witness statements or to any of the medical experts. He added: Ms Palmeraposs social media posts also show her attending musical and other events with large numbers of people and noise. He further noted that she had also gone travelling to India four months after her crash and taken a skiing holiday in the Rockies in February . The judge said: It is undoubtedly clear that some of the images portrayed on the claimantaposs social media call for an explanation. But he went on: In determining how much reliance to place upon those social media posts...social media tends to paint a glossy picture of the posteraposs le. The claimant repeatedly denied that she had intended to mislead anyone, the court heard. She described her social media posts as a snapshot of what you want people to see, the positive and exciting side of your le, not the day-to-day dficulties, the judge said. It was...important to the claimantaposs identity to be seen by friends or others as doing normal things. The judge found that she was not being dishonest about her sporting activity being severely impacted, despite the images she posted. She had always been competitive, had been a sports captain, had been in competitions and had skied, he said. The sporting activity she undertook afterward and posted about was relaxing in comparison, he went on, pointing out that she took three hours and  minutes to finish the Bear Grylls event at a gentle jog and missed out several obstacles. I found the claimant to be an honest, helpful, impressive and dignied witness in her own case. I consider that the substantial number of symptoms the claimant now has arose from the outset of the accident and were caused or substantially contributed by it. He concluded that Ms Palmer, who formerly worked in media and marketing for the Ministry of Sound nightclub and the Hippodrome Casino, would have progressed in her career to become a chief marketing officer on a £,-a-year salary had it not been for the accident. He handed her £.m for future loss of earnings as part of her £.m payout.

But when they got inside things took a turn for the worst and the man said he felt no connection, and when pressed why he confessed that Kailee was too fat. What do you think of the manaposs behaviour  Let us know in the comments...She explained: We got to talking and I thought the conversation was going great. We were talking for about five minutes and he looked over at me and said, aposhey - Iaposm going to be honest, Iaposm not really feeling a connectionapos. Kind-hearted Kailee then askedheaposd rather leave orthey should go ahead with the meal, and he opted to stay at the restaurant.  She continued: We sit down at our table and I took off my coat and he just looked at me. He said, aposyeah I thought so.apos She then asked what he meant by that comment, and he replied: Fitness and being healthy is really a big part of my le. Puzzled, Kailee asked him to explain, and the man said: Well, youaposre too fat for me.  Kailee was so shocked by his vile comments that she walked out, leaving him to dine alone. Later, she explained the whole story on TikTok and said the manaposs beauty standards were skewed. In the video, Kailee said: His exact words. Youaposre. Too. Fat. For. Me. What  Come on.

I’ve come in to try size  jeans in dferent shops, she explained. I want to see how they really fit, no matter what dress size you are. You might wonder why one minute everything fits, and two months later you can’t even zip those jeans up.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. The first pair of jeans that Maria tried on was from HM - a pair of skinny high waist denim. These are HM, she said. I’m a UK . I’ve had two children and they just don’t fit. I want to show you that on the high street,you’re feeling deflated in a changing room, it’s not you - it’s them. Next up was a pair from Zara, which Maria could barely zip up. But when she tried on a pair of size  jeans from Next, they fit easily - with a lot of room to spare. And the same with her choice from New Look - she was able to button them up with ease. I can now laugh it off, but for so many women, it’s not that easy, she sighed. I hope this video makes you remember - size is just a number. We need to ignore the sizes that are on these labels. Because these companies are not consistent. We need to tell our daughters, our friends, our mums, our sisters - that our value is not based on the size of our clothes. So next time you go shopping and you can’t work out why the jeans don’t fit just remember it’s not you - it’s them. In the caption to the Instagram video, Maria explained that she used to not buy clothes in the size up. I used to feel embarrassed, ashamed, insecure. And now thanks to the power of the internet, I realise this is a massive thing that so many women are noticing and flagging. I hope highlighting this reminds you thatyou can’t fit in those jeans or that dress, please size up and please don’t feel upset doing so. Fans rush to praise her message in the comments, as one person said: Love this! I always come out of Zara feeling a fat frump and want t go home and be nil by mouth, so at least this video shows that the sizes are all dferent. Another wrote: This is the best thing Iaposve seen today. A third commented: I love this! So true, I hate sizing up but Iaposm slowly becoming more comfortable doing so... hopefully, Iaposll get there one day.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.The second lunch box contains cheese and tomato sandwich, fruit, vegetable sticks and a yoghurt. The first box contains twice the sugar and half the second packed lunch. Andthat wasnapost enough to send alarm bells ringing for parents, the contents of the unhealthier box also happen to cost twice as much, due to most of it being pre-packaged items.Speaking to news.au, Cancer Council NSW’s senior nutrition program officer Nina Tan explained that many parents buy pre-packaged snacks for school because it saves time - or because children really want them.She said: When it comes to pre-packaged foods, companies are plastering them with nutrition-related marketing claims like ‘source of calcium’ or ‘no articial…’, and adding colours, cartoon characters and fonts designed to draw in both parents and kids.  Bright colours, cartoon animals and fun shapes are used to attract children, and text like ‘no need to chill’ and ‘the perfect lunch box biscuits’ are used to appeal to parents’ desire to make easy and quick lunch box choices for their kids, but these snacks can be packed with sugar, salt and kilojoules and often don’t provide children with the nutrients they need.Cancer Council NSW recently assessed  popular lunch box snacks in Australia and found nearly  per cent could be classied as unhealthy. Ms Tan added that they were particularly concerned by the results given the role lunch box snacks played in a children’s diet.In an attempt to tackle this concern, the council have since set up a website for parents to help them pack healthier lunches.

After moving into their new home, the poster began parking in the spot right outside as it appeared that no one was parking there. Their roommate had also informed them that there was no assigned parking in the neighbourhood, meaning they were perfectly within their rights to do so.Little did they know at the time that their perfectly reasonable choice would lead to them making an unexpected enemy, with one of their neighbours being hellbent on getting the same spot.

Soon after settling in, the driver noted that their neighbor would park in the same spot as them and would even park in it while they were away.Given that the spot wasnapost actually assigned to anyone, they were perfectly fine with sharing. But then things got a little more intense.They recalled: The problems started arising when they would leave and then put a chair in the spot, basically prohibiting me from entering the spot. They will also tend to block the spot which further irritates me because they have theI canapost have it no one can have it mentality.The poster is now considering just moving the chair, remarking that itaposs ridiculous to hold a spot that isnapost assigned, however they are concerned that doing so would make them the a**hole in this situation.Many of those commenting have since reassured the writer of the post that they are absolutely not the one being unreasonable here. One person even urged them to move the chair every time you see it, even when you don’t need the spot while another no-nonsense person remarked,I had to move it a second time, it’d be into a dumpster.Thinking along similar lines, a third person suggested: Forget moving it, Iaposd throw it out.

And,that wasnapost bad enough, the womanaposs own husband even agreed with him and told her she should be dressing more appropriately in her own home. Although we just got back from our honeymoon, I still wear lingerie and sometimes walk around in them when I wake up in the morning when making coffee or breakfast, she wrote on Redditaposs AITA forum.The other day I was in the kitchen preparing coffee while my husband was out and heard a knock on the door, I immediately went to grab my long rope before answering.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. When the woman answered the door, she was greeted by her next door neighbour, who informed her that his seven-year-old daughteraposs room looks onto their living room, and she recently saw her wearing inappropriate clothes when looking out using her binoculars. I was taken back. turns out his daughter uses her binoculars to supposedly watch the yard but she obviously peeped through our large glass windows to see inside even though we have curtains on, she continued. My neighbour said this wasnapost cool and his daughter just saw apossomething she cannotapos un-see, that is not appropriate. I asked him what he meant and he requested that I be a little considerate when it comes to clothingbut I thought that was just ridiculous since that is my house. The woman argued back, telling him that she has a right to wear whatever she wants in her own home and that his little girl has no business peeping. He told her that sheaposs just a curious little girl and meant no harm, prompting her to tell him to leave. He didnapost take it well and implied that heaposd take steps to ensure I donapost aposexposeapos his daughter to stuff like that in the future. He left and I just thought my entire day was ruined especially after he said heaposd bring this incident to the neighbourhoodaposs groupaposs attention, she continued. I told my husband what happened when he got home and he agreed with our neighbour saying that I should aposjust leave the lingerie in the bedroomapos where it belongs and learn to put some decent clothes on to avoid this type of incident. He also said I was wrong to speak to our neighbour like that and thathe was in his shoes and his kid witnessed aposthatapos heaposd be just as furiousnot more, so we should cut our neighbour some slack. The woman then turned to Reddit to question whether she was in the wrong or whether her neighbour had crossed a line. Both men are blaming you for being comfy behind closed doors while the neighbours child peeps through windows with binoculars. He should teach his child to mind their damn business, one Reddit user wrote. My petty a** would withhold any intimacy or body contact from the husband because the neighbours might see and blame you for being to inappropriate for his daughter to watch through binoculars from their house. Another added: Your neighbour is and the fact your husband agreed with them is problematic as well. He should buy you more lingerie as an apology.

But now, some schools have even gone as far as banning certain sugary items, in a bid to curb the national issue.While the issue of what your kids should be eating at school continues to be debated, one nursery teacher has revealed that what you put in your childrenaposs packed lunches could actually say more about your parenting than you think. Sharon Birch, owner and founder of the Footprints Learning for Le nursery in Hartlepool, says that she and her colleagues pass no judgement on parents, but try to gently encourage them to provide healthy and nutritious meals for their kids, by giving out helpful guides on what could be included. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.It doesn’t have to be a work of art, haute cuisine, or done to impress, it just has to be healthy and filling, she told The Sun.Sharon says the most common item found in childrenaposs lunch boxes is sandwiches, which is a tradition dating back many years, but the popular fillings have changed over the years. Sometimes, kids come to nursery with shop bought sandwiches in their packs, which Sharon says is usually representative of parents who work long hours or even those who work in supermarkets. Chocolate and crisps are generally frowned upon, and Sharon says they do try and encourage parents to come up with healthier alternatives, but admits they are very common staples for a lot of families. Meanwhile, fruit is always encouraged, but she says they do tend to step in to help with items such as grapes to ensure theyaposre cut and arenapost at risk of being a choking hazard. We understand that some parents financially struggle, and often unhealthy choices are cheaper in the supermarkets, which makes for tough choices, Sharon continued. One young girl would regularly bring in a huge naan bread, a few bars of chocolate and little . Mum told us that was all she’d eat but we offered some healthier snacks and she loved them. She went on to say that some parents will pack more mature foods, such as pitta bread and hummus and pistachios for their kids, but revealed these will only get tossed aside to share a friendaposs naughty crisps. Some parents have time to create beautul masterpiece lunches for their kids, whereas others will throw together whatever they can in the spare time they have, and both of those things are fine - thereaposs no parent shaming here.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

The ex-staffers have spoken of the airline authorities acting as the “weight police” and keeping tabs on employees’ weight. Some employees were then put into the “Appearance Management Programme”they had gone up a dress size, they said. The staff said they were told this was to ensure that they were putting on a “glamorous Emirates face” at all times.The former staff also claimed they were threatened with pay cutsthey didn’t keep up the airline’s tough image policy,Express reported.Karla Bayson, who worked for the airline for nine years, told Insider that the strict dress code banned visible tattoos.  Staff were also only allowed red, clear or neutral nail polish and had to have neat hair at all times, according to the crew member. While this might seem strict to people working in other industries, it is quite standard for cabin crew. However, Bayson claimed Emirates cabin crew were also subject to strict weight rules and constantly monitored. She said she saw colleagues told to “lose it”they had gained weight. Staff were then “checked again” in two weeks to seethey’d dropped the weight. Bayson said that some staff were suspended from inflight duties because they had gained weight. She said: “If they see you popping out from the unorm, they’re going to put you on the ground.”  The former cabin crew member claimed staff who had given birth were sometimes grounded until they had lost weight. Another staff member claimed crew were encouraged to report other staff who had gained weight. Any staff who had gained weight were given strict diet and exercise plans to follow and attendants claimed they could face pay cutsthey failed to lose the weight. One ex crew member, Maya Dukaric, said that the airline’s “weight police” would approach crew at airports and say “Hey babe, you need to slow it down”. An Emirates spokesperson told Express: “As a global airline, we treat the wellbeing of our employees with the highest priority, and we believe being fit and healthy, both physically and mentally, is a critical aspect in them carrying out their duties safely and effectively.  “It may not always be apparent to our customers, but the responsibilities of our cabin crew are vast, and their ability to influence and achieve safe outcomes when needed, requires extensive training and a minimum standard of physical fitness. “We’re proud of our colleagues who form Emirates’ cabin crew: who provide unwavering, exceptional service and who help maintain the safety and quality of operations and service Emirates is known for. “We do not comment on internal policies or procedures or specic, confidential cases of existing or past employees.Just last yearThe Mirror reported ona veteran Emirates flight attendant who claimed she quit her job after three years of being asked to check her weight because she was considered too heavy.Duygu Karaman was subject to the confidence crushing weight checks after a colleague secretly reported her, she alleges, and claims she was even put on a weight management programme.

The flight attendant, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, eventually left the job after she claims she had three years of weight checks.

Waring, a self-proclaimed UFO expert who is reportedly based in Taiwan, took to his blog, UFO Sightings Daily today, to share his most recent find from Google MapsMr Waring claims to have spotted the UFO in these bushes in South Africa Image: Google MapsByKirsty CardReporter:,  Jan | commentsA Google Maps user who claims to have used the  to locate a aposcrashed alien spacecraftapos hidden in bushes believes the pilot may be living among humans. Scott C. Waring, a self-proclaimed UFO expert who is reportedly based in Taiwan, took to his blog, UFO Sightings Daily today, to share his most recent find from Google Maps. His claim is that there is a UFO hidden in South Africa at the coordinates of °apos.S °apos.E, that has made markings ‘similar to crop circles.apos And his conspiracy theory doesnapost stop at a crashed alien visitor, the Daily Star reported. Waring has explained that he believes the pilot of the craft now lives among humans and is manipulating our technological advancements.  I was exploring on Google Maps when I came across a metallic disk landed in South Africa,” he said. “Itaposs hidden in a grove of trees and far from any city. The object looks like a classic disk with a pointed hump at its centre. One photo even shows a huge circle around it...similar to that of a crop circle, but then disappears in the next photo months later. It looks like this is a landing location of an alien craft that attempted to hide its existence from the world. The pilot has created a dirt road to the area and is probably in a city nearby manipulating the direction the human race will go by introducing new technology, cures, ideas and such. This needs further investigation. We need someone on location. Iaposll ask around to seeitaposs possible to get more info on it.  The apparent UFO discovery attracted the attention of Waringaposs fans. He claims to have spotted the image on January , . One fan said: The best way is to go there to the disc and check to see what it is. It can very well be a craft that went down due to problems. It is not a natural formation due to the features it has. The so-called expert makes frequent claims about secret alien le and hidden alien bases - which he says he has found on Google Maps - on his blog.Earlier this year Waring, who also runs a YouTube channel and website calledET Data Base , claimed to have found theaposentrance to an alien baseaposafter spotting an odd formation onGoogleEarth.He said the peculiar shape is located on a apossmall and uninhabited island in Indonesiaapos and believes it to be a doorway to an aposunderground alien baseapos. It doesnapost fit in with its environment, he explained, and is in a secluded location where aposaliens would love to have a hidden baseapos. Using a tool on Google Earth, he measured the opening to find it was  metres across, which he says is big enough to aposget a lot of alien ships in thereapos.

Experts warned he was a heart attack waiting to happen due to severe obesity being connected to a fourfold increase in cardiac failure. Their predictions were backed up by the deaths of his father Kim Jong-il and grandfather Kim Il-sung who both died of heart attacks. Kim is thought to snack heavily on Swiss cheese and lobster washed down with up to ten bottles of wine per night, reports the Daily Star.Speculation circulated that he was suffering an illness or had passed away when he was not spotted for weeks amid health concerns. The people of North Korea were later shocked to see their leader emerge having dropped in size after a period of absence last year. His trimmer look has since prompted a new set of rumours that he may have had a gastric bypass.  It follows reports that he lost around lbs within just three months which was quickly highlighted on state television.

Declan Haughney, , and another man brought Peadar Doyle, , to the post office to collect his pension on Friday, not realising he had died.During the funeral service on Monday, priest Fr Thomas Little said “no one should ever point a finger” after what happened, the Irish Mirror reports. The emotional service brought together Peadaraposs family at the Church of the Holy Family in Co Carlow. Declan was seen carrying his uncleaposs coffin as Peadar’s niece, Charmaine gave a speech about how he was “a hero” and “like a father” to her and others.  She said: “Peadar treated each and every one of his nieces and nephews aswe were his own children – and he was like a second father to us all.” Charmaine added: “Peadar’s positivity was contagious. He was witty and had a great memory of quotes from classical movies, literature and poetry.” She told how Peadar was a perfectionist” and a great cook, cleaner, had worked as a caretaker and a waiter. He was also an exceptional painter, she said.  She said her uncle “made you feel cared for, special and loved in a way no one  could”. She added: “Peadar was a quiet man who was always proud of and devoted to his family. In public, he was dignied and polite – kind and cheerful to everyone he met. “To him, loving and caring for his family and making so many memories with them was what was most important to him.”  Charmaine ended her eulogy by saying her uncle was someone whose greatness wasn’t known to many, but to those closest to him, he was their everything. She added: “He has made a monumental impression on our hearts and on our souls. His heart was bigger than himself and I’m so lucky to have had such a teacher in my le.” A Garda investigation into the circumstances of the events surrounding Peadar’s death and his escorted walk remains active – though no one has been arrested. Declan previously told the Irish Mirror how he was branded a “murderer” in the local community ever since the sensational story emerged.But he insisted he’s “not an eejit” – and believes he’s being accused of dragging his dead uncle into a post office to rob his pension because he previously stole from his aunt. He said: “Why would I want to rob my uncle  I’m  years of age yeah, I’m not a child, I’m not a young fella. I’m not an eejit to walk into Hoseys with a dead man and collect his money. Am I cuckoo  Am I cuckoo  I’m not.”  The priest added: “I would like to say too that I was deeply saddened and shocked at the way that his untimely and sad death has been portrayed. “It wasn’t fair to you as a family, it wasn’t fair to Peadar and it was so wrong to have done such a thing. “Nobody should ever point a finger at anybody because as Peadar would say to youyou point a finger at somebody, you know there are three fingers pointing back to you.” The priest continued: “We know that and I know that too and it’s very hurtful and I’m just sorry for the family for that to have happened. “It shouldn’t have happened, but I will say this too – it was uplting to see the number of people that turned out yesterday in the quiet and gentle way to light their candle on the street where he lived. “It shows that goodness always wins out in the long run. Peadar was bigger and better than all the criticism and the horrible things that were said. “He was far bigger than any of that and I do deeply believe he is with his God, to be reunited with his family, his brothers, his father and mother and those that have gone before him.” Garda Superintendent Aidan Brennan, who is leading the investigation, said they want to “establish when exactly Mr Doyle died”. Supt Brennan told KCLR FM that gardai have spoken with the men who brought Mr Doyle to the post office and received “good co-operation” from them.

Britain has given thousands of NLAW anti-tank missiles to Kyiv’s forcesA British military instructor trains Ukrainian service members to use the next generation light anti-tank weapon, NLAW Image: via REUTERSByChris HughesDefence and Security Editor:,  Jan | comments Russian special forces and spies are in Ukraine in “signicant” numbers - in the starkest warning of oncoming war, Britain has revealed. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Moscow’s elite forces have advanced across the border ahead of the main force of combat troops.The Mirror has learned Russia’s GRU military intelligence unit and Spetsnaz crack troops are believed already to be in Ukraine preparing for war. They are seen as an advance party appearing to plot an attack by , regular forces gathered at Ukraine’s eastern flank as well as thousands more in Belarus. It came as British special forces are preparing for a mass evacuation of more than , British nationalsthey become stranded.  They are being told to register with the skeleton embassy left in Kyiv, from where they will be air-evacuated or bussed by road  miles east to Poland.Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned British troops could soon be sent to eastern Europe to help bolster NATO against Russia.Mr Wallace told the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee there were iniduals already in Ukraine “linked to the Russian state in ways that are not conventional” and “that should give cause for concern”. He added: “We are becoming aware of a signicant number of iniduals that are assessed to be associated with Russian military advance force operations that currently are located in Ukraine. “And that is what we expect to see next and what we’re seeing now.”  Ukraine’s SBU intelligence and security agency is working round the clock to seize Russian spooks trying to pinpoint the country’s defences. Several have been arrested in the contested Donbas area in recent months and Ukraine forces have massively locked down security. Russian covert operatives in Ukraine will be preparing espionage, sabotage operations and anything to undermine Ukraine’s defences. Britain has given thousands of NLAW anti-tank missiles to Kyiv’s forces to help them hold back a Russian armoured attack, along with  UK military trainers.  Mr Wallace added: “Any crossing into Ukraine, whether small or large, would be viewed as a breach of that sovereignty, against international law and an invasion. “You can’t be half-pregnant, you are either invading a country or you are not.” On Tuesday Mr Johnson warned the UK may deploy troops to protect Nato allies in Europe should Russia invade, saying Vladimir Putin faces “ferocious” Ukrainian resistance. The PM said the UK and its allies stand ready to impose “heavy economic sanctions” on Russia, amid fears of “bloodshed comparable to the first war in Chechnya or Bosnia”.  Mr Johnson told the House of Commons: “If Russia pursues this path, many Russian mothers’ sons will not be coming home. “The response in the international community would be the same and the pain that would be inflicted on the Russian economy will be the same.”Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party “stands resolute” in supporting Ukraine.Mr Johnson added: “The British Army leads the Nato battle group in Estonia andRussia invades Ukraine, we would look to contribute to any new Nato deployments to protect our allies in Europe.”  He went on: “There is nothing new about large and powerful nations using the threat of brute force to terry reasonable people into giving way to otherwise completely unacceptable demands. “ButPresident Putin was to choose the path of bloodshed and destruction, he must realise that it’d be both tragic and futile, and nor should we allow him to believe that he could easily take some smaller portion of Ukraine - to salami-slice - because the resistance would be ferocious.” The SAS-led UK evacuation mission is already in Ukraine preparing for an emergency evacuation, along with the Special Forces Support Group. Foreign Office advice was posted stating: ”British nationals in Ukraine are requested to register their presence in Ukraine. This will allow us to provide the latest information but it is still advised that British nationals continue to read and follow FCDO Travel Advice.” The request for UK nationals to register their details is a ’standard operating procedure’ by the FCDO when they planning an evacuation such as in the Lebanon, Sierra Leone and more recently Kabul. A senior source said: “It could be a simple operationwe can get people to the airport and fly out, butMoscow imposes an air embargo it will be a nightmare. “We know the Germans and other countries are also planning to airlt their people and we are looking at using a road route to the Polish border, but will be the FCDO’s call.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Foreign OfficeNatoBritish ArmyBoris JohnsonBen WallaceVladimir PutinArmed forcesSpecial forcesPoliticsDaily MirrorUkraine crisis\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , ..removeA quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Address to a Haggis by Robert Burns, in FullFair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labourdight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-nicola-sturgeon-say-today-face-masks-working-home","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeonhas given give her weekly Covid update in parliament today.The final restrictions that were put in place in response to the Omicron iantwere removed on Monday, January .In an update last week the First Minister announced that nightclubs would be able to reopen, and caps on indoor events and table service requirements where alcohol is served would be removed.These measures were put in place in December, alongside a maximum capacity of  people for outdoor events.

“From Friday, face coverings will no longer be required for any adult taking part in organised activities when they are directly interacting with children under the age of

two days after they arrive back in Scotland. Currently, the international \" fully vaccinated\" definition includes two doses of the Covid vaccine and not the booster dose. However, this is being kept under review. Ms Sturgeon warned that travel restrictions could be reintroduced in light of a new iant so this is constantly being monitored. Mask wearing in schoolsMs Sturgeon has been facing renewed calls to remove the requirement for mask-wearing in Scottish schools.Masks are no longer needed in English secondary schools with the requirement being dropped from Thursday  January.Face coverings will no longer need to be worn by adults who are leading activities in childcare and early learning settings with children under  years old. Mask wearing restrictions will be changing in schools due to the increase in cases for this age group but the advice will be kept under \"close and regular review\".Strategic framework The First Minister was expected to outline a strategic framework or  roadmap to move the country to a “less restrictive” society.Ms Strugeon has confirmed that a full outline will be available in the coming weeks. Distance Aware SchemeNicola Sturgeon has encouraged Scots to take note of the Scottish Government’s Distance Aware scheme.The First Minister said badges and lanyards with the Distance Aware logo, indicating the wearer would like extra space, would be available to anyone who wants one.She said: “Soyou or anyone you know is worried about being out and about and would feel safer with a bit more space, please get a Distance Aware badge.“And for

deaths of people who have tested positiveThere were  people in intensive care on Monday, January  with recently confirmed COVID- and , people were in hospital yesterday with recently confirmed

It#s so heartening to experience the children#s energy, enthusiasm and awe when learning about whales and dolphins.Our sessions are so important as they spark passion and interest in the local environment and encourage conversations about the actions that we can all take to help protect it, now and in the future.Players of People#s Postcode Lottery have supported the charity, raising £, since  to support the development and delivery of new and immersive learning experiences that bring the marine environment to le for children in coastal communities.Our latest creative project, funded by People#s Postcode Trust and Sea-Changers, has been to launch the best of their education sessions online, working with schools and home educators across Scotland and England.Based around the trust#s research expeditions, these digital sessions introduce the amazing ersity of whales, dolphins and sharks in Scotland and give children a glimpse into what it is like to work at sea, studying and protecting ocean giants.Prior to the pandemic, every year school groups would join the charity#s crew on board their research vessel, Silurian, as she was temporarily transformed into a floating classroom.The famous yacht has now visited communities on most of the larger Hebridean islands including Mull, Skye, Islay, Lewis, Harris, Uist, Barra, Coll, Tiree and the Small Isles as well as some of the largest towns along Scotland#s west coast, such as Oban, Mallaig and Ullapool.Raising awareness and aspirations for green careers features at the centre of the charity#s education strategy.Each year the trust runs dedicated research expeditions for - and -year-olds on board Silurian.These young adults gain hands-on experience monitoring marine le, including collecting data as part of the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust long-term citizen science project, which informs local and national conservation efforts.Anyone can help the charity monitor marine le, by reporting their sightings of cetaceans – the collective name for whales, dolphins and porpoises – and basking sharks online.The trust also offers guided field trips for schools, so that younger children can take part and experience the thrill of spotting seabirds and marine mammals from land.Local wildle is not only amazing to see, but each species also has an important biological role to play.By protecting whales and giving marine ecosystems the chance to recover, we can improve the health and resilience of our seas and in turn the climate and planet for us all.We#re really proud to support the next generation of ocean ambassadors and look forward to when Silurian can once again become a floating classroom and set sail for island schools.In the meantime, teachers or home educators keen to take part in our online sessions are encouraged to get in touch by emailing info@hwdt.org"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week january 7 2022","story":"He followed a very dferent path.

This was eased on January .However, the requirements for face coverings and self-isolation will remain for the foreseeable future.Announcing the end of the restrictions last Tuesday, Sturgeon said: “Although signicant pressures and uncertainties do remain, the data nevertheless gives us confidence that we have turned the corner on the Omicron wave.”She told MSPs: “A combination of booster vaccinations, the willingness of the public to adapt their behaviour to help stem transmission, and the temporary protective measures introduced in December, has helped blunt the impact of the Omicron wave.”Changes to #coronavirus restrictions from  January:🔹 End to m distancing and table service in hospitality🔹 Nightclubs in Scotland can re-open🔹 Non-professional indoor contact sports can resume🔹 No attendance limits at indoor eventsMore ➡️ https:t.co IhaJOcfqJh pic gcHXLwMtSturgeon also announced there would be no change to the vaccine passport scheme.According to the Scottish Parliament schedule, Nicola Sturgeon is due to give a Covid update on Tuesday, January .

In fact, the benefits of plants and green spaces are now so well documented that medical professionals are beginning to see gardening as an important means of helping improve the wellbeing of some patients.Although not everyone is fortunate enough to have a garden, most will have space for an indoor plant and the value of those shouldn’t be overlooked. They remove the invisible air-borne pollutants that exist in all homes coming from everyday household cleaning products, decorating materials, upholstery and furniture.This, together with a plant’s natural ability to absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, means that they are continuously improving the quality of the air that we breathe.In addition to these direct physical and mental benefits, home-grown vegetables are undoubtedly one of the best ways to source fresh, healthy food and reduce food miles. Just imagine the satisfaction of growing your own herbs and veg, and collecting on the very day you plan to use them in your meal – it just doesn’t get any fresher than that!If you’d like to try growing your own fresh, healthy meals, here’s a few ideas about how you might start:l Potatoes should be grown from certied seed potatoes which have been tested, are disease-free and true to iety. Seed potatoes are available now in reputable garden centres and you can start them off indoors, encouraging them to sproutso they have a start when you plant them out. Potatoes will generally be planted out in March April, with First Earlies harvesting as early as June July. Second Earlies can be harvested in August September, while Maincrop potatoes can be harvested into October. The early potatoes are those wonderfully tasty ‘new potatoes’ but don’t store as well as the maincrop ieties are able to be harvested and kept for use throughout the winter.l Brassica vegetables such as cabbage, caullower, sprouts and broccoli can be grown from seed starting in the next few weeks or purchased as seedlings in the garden centre in springtime when it’s time to plant them out.l Root vegetables such as carrots or parsnips can be dficult to transplant and prefer to be grown from seed sown directly into the place where they’ll grow.l Salad vegetables are mostly very easy to grow from seed and can be started indoors in the next few weeks until it’s warm enough to let them grow outdoors. It’s also an economical way to feed the family – for the price of a lettuce in the supermarket, you could buy a pack of seeds that could grow several hundred lettuce! Many salad vegetables only take a few weeks from sowing to harvesting, so we suggest that you sow a few little and often and you’ll have a continuous crop for many months of the year. Extend the season by starting or finishing the crop indoors when the weather is too cold for growing outdoor.l Microgreens, miniature vegetables that make an attractive and tasty garnish, take only days to grow from seed and are an easy kitchen window-sill crop. As with the salad vegetables, sow little and often to have a continuous crop.Hopefully this gives you some suggestions to help you with your plans for a healthier lestyle and even helps your budget!If you need more help and advice, our plant team are always delighted to help and you will find lots more information on the seed packets and online at merryhattonHappy gardening for !"},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-gastropub-named-best-uk","story":"The Bonnie Badger in Gullane, East Lothian placed in the - category, being awarded position number .The Estrella Damm Top  Gastropub Awards is created each year by an academy of several hundred judges spread throughout the UK who vote for who they think are the must-see gastropubs.The academy is made up of food industry experts, chefs, operators, food writers and journalists, all of whom keep a close eye on the market and the trends within.class\"instagram-media\"data-instgrm-captioneddata-instgrm-permalink\"https:www.instagram p CYUfxDIBS  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"data-instgrm-version\"\"style\"background: #fffborder: border-radius: pxbox-shadow:   px  rgba,  px px  rgbamargin: pxmax-width: pxmin-width: pxpadding: width: .%width: -webkit-calcwidth: calc\"href\"https:www.instagram p CYUfxDIBS  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"style\"background: #ffffffline-height: padding:  text-align: centertext-decoration: nonewidth: %\"target\"_blank\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: %flex-grow: height: pxmargin-right: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: flexflex-direction: columnflex-grow: justy-content: center\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxmargin-bottom: pxwidth: px\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: block height: px margin:  auto px width: px\"width\"px\"\"px\"viewBox\"   \"version\".\"xmlns\"https:www.w.org  svg\"xmlns:xlink\"https:www.w.org  xlink\"\" fill\"#\"d\"M.,.

There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , .A quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Fair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labour dight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-nicola-sturgeon-say-today-face-masks-working-home","story":"The final restrictions that were put in place in response to the Omicron iant were removed on Monday, January .In an update last week the First Minister announced that nightclubs would be able to reopen, and caps on indoor events and table service requirements where alcohol is served would be removed.These measures were put in place in December, alongside a maximum capacity of  people for outdoor events.

Each day there is a plethora of indignation either for or against the SNP and or the Prime Minister.The other day I laughed out loud at Dr Gerald Edwards and his complaint that the SNP was making political mileage out of Boris Johnson’s behaviour. What on earth does any political party do when their opposite numbers self-destruct It never ceases to amaze me how certain correspondents’ blood pressure goes through the roof at the mere mention of the SNP. That is, until I realised I had the very same reaction to the sight or sound of Greta Thunberg.But what is independence  For me it is to separate from the voters in and around London who have dominated our Scottish world for decades. It is not about being anti-English, as I have the same liking for them as I do for French, German, Scandinavian or other peoples.I have written in the past about the pound and economy and, to tell the truth, those letter writers who expound on this or that percentage just leave me cold.

It stated that Lord Hailsham’s speech at the installation ceremony was reported at the time as providing a \"profound and noble start\" to his rectorship. Students at the university had not always been so well-behaved.His Lordship was in a fortunate position compared with his predecessor, Rab Butler, elected as Rector in  when Home Secretary. He had been greeted by the students at his installation with an exotic array of egg, flour and tomato. Lord Boyd Orr, University Chancellor, also got caught up in this salvo and, obviously not sitting on the fence, referred to the students as \"moronic, witless and humourless\".Butler, however, appeared to be composed about the boisterous conduct of the students, observing that he had witnessed much over the years in the House of Commons, though it had never got as far there as a selection of food items being thrown at him.Perhaps he was prepared to accept that the behaviour on that day could be embraced within the sentiments of the song\"Gaudeamus igitur, Juvenes dum sumus\" .Ian W Thomson, Lenzie."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-nicola-sturgeon-must-know-no-case-independence","story":"It seems to me that the reason that Ms Sturgeon concentrates on the process of independence – ie, endless referendums – is because she knows that there is no credible case for independence itself. She indulges in displacement activity in place of effective action.There is no economic case for Scottish independence. Every effort to produce one runs into the sands of hard facts and evidence, which show clearly that Scotland benefits from pooling and sharing within the UK to the tune of around £ billion annually and would be so much poorer after separation. And the EU will not ride to the rescue of a country with such a large deficit, without its own currency, no central bank and few foreign reserves.There is no historical case. Scotland is not a colony and is not suppressed in any way as part of the UK. Scots and Scotland have benefited greatly, and continue to do so, from being part of team GB.There is no cultural case. The lives and attitudes of city dwellers in Aberdeen or Glasgow are little dferent from the same sample in Birmingham, Bristol or Cardf. Rural le in England is much the same as rural le Scotland or Wales.There is no legal case. The UK is a unitary state formed by the willing agreement of all parties in the Act of Union and its legal status has never been challenged.There is no geographical case. We are  million people crammed on to a small island. The very idea of splitting it up into dferent countries in a world where size and influence matters could serve as the very definition of foolishness.And importantly, there is no democratic case. We had our referendum. The outcome was decisive and should put the question to bed for at least a generation.Instead of continually distracting the faithful with referendums that never happen, Ms Sturgeon should be considering why, after  years in existence, her party has dismally failed to create even the semblance of an evidence-led case for independence. Let me give her a clue: there is no such case, it does not exist, it never has.Alex Gallagher, Labour councillor, Largs.KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROADWHAT a tease that Nicola Sturgeon is. She told us in May that a vote for the SNP was a vote to support her management of the Covid crisis. Now she tells us that voting SNP meant supporting her next push for Indyref, for which she claims a mandate. She has promised her troops a referendum before the end of , and she will soon set out the legislative timetable for her referendum.Yet Ms Sturgeon also tells us that the course of the pandemic remains \"highly unpredictable\". Further, the Holyrood legislative timetable has no mention of a referendum bill. That is before Ms Sturgeon encounters a no-doubt-polite refusal from the UK Government to sanction a second referendum. She admits that she hasn’t decided on the date for the introduction of the referendum bill, but she will take that decision in the next few weeks, to enable a referendum to be held before the end of .We have been here before, year after year since , and in each year the can has been kicked a bit further down the road. I don’t think any of us needs to keep our diary clear for a referendum in . That noise you hear is the can being kicked down the road again.Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh.WHY WE NEED A YES VOTEI MUST concur with Ken Mackay . If ever we needed convincing of the need for self-determination, the need to run our own affairs, the evidence is all there. The illegal prorogation of Parliament, parties while the country was in lockdown, dodgy decoration donations, Tory MPs breaking lobbying rules, the list could go on and begs the questio:, why would we want to be part of this scandal and corruption Over the last month or so the media has reported that there is still plenty of support for Boris Johnson south of the Border, highlighting Mr Mackays point about separating from voters around London. It is predicted here in Scotland that the Conservatives will be wiped out at the next Westminster election, revealing the clear gap between voters in Scotland and those in England. Scotland seriously can’t afford another Westminster Government she did not vote for, she can’t afford any more legislation from Westminster regarding reserved matters and she certainly can’t afford Mr Johnson for a day longer than necessary.

There will be little talk of the enormous problems he tackled successfully, the health problems including intensive care and lately with his family just intense speculation on a successor – followed by a frantic searching for dirton that successor possibly going back to schooldays and a cigarette smoked behind the bicycle sheds. I suspect that there will follow a similar trashing of the leader of the Labour Party by the extreme left in order to re-instate their man.Is this what we have sunk to as a nation, no longer seeking people of actionbut media-attractive popular personalities  No longer talking about a desire to serve, but an unhealthy grasping at power for powers sake  No longer outlining what we hope to achieve in the next  months but how much we will spend usually multiplied over three or five years because it looks better and hides any temptation to link spend to success  No longer putting forward solutions to problems but articulately outlining that something is a challenge and expecting praise for identying it Heaven help uswe ever have to go to war –we do find a leader with the courage to make the dficult big decisions – we, through the media, will drag him or her down with distracting information or demand openness that will render a successful outcome impossible.James Watson, Dunbar.THE GLOBAL AGGRESSORIT looks asUkraine is heading for meltdown, leading to the general public fearing Russia and its territorial aspirations, as that is what we are repeatedly told to do.Last year, just like every other preceding year, one country alone was responsible for more than  per cent of all the money spent on Planet Earth on weapons of war meanwhile the standard of living of its own citizens is in decline. Since its creation, that itself by war, other than for five years, that rapacious country has been continuously involved overtly or covertly in armed conflict in some distant part of the globe: it currently has in the order of , servicemen stationed abroad, many actively involved in fighting and killing in at least six countries, on occasion against the wishes of their elected governments. Annually it gives military aid of . billion to one foreign government which is used to further the apartheid policy of its recipient against its indigenous population. The country I describe spies electronically on the general public of its allies to circumvent unhelpful legislation that prevents their own governments from doing so without specic legal permission. Its historic clandestine involvement in the politics of Ukraine is likely to cause a war which could spread to other European states. So we have every right to be afraid of this country, the only thing being that I’m not describing Russia, but the United States.The facts are that in  US military spending was  billion, Russia bn and the UK bn. There is nowhere in the world where there is stre that the US military industrial complex doesn’t have a finger in the pie, and to keep the profits rolling in people must die.David J Crawford, Glasgow.SLAVE TRADE-OFFI DO wonder what the history meddlers of Edinburgh and wherewould make of the following: “In  AD after a four-month Viking siege of the stronghold that was Dumbarton Rock a flotilla of  boats took prisonersto Dublin where they were sold as slaves” .Dan Edgar, Rothesay.Read more: We need an inquiry into slavery review controversy"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13407684.jpg?type=article-full","title":"sides-rewilding-debate-wrong-says-author","story":"But, says Ben Rawlence, who looked into the story of the tree while researching his beautul and affecting book, The Treeline: The Last Forest And The Future Of Le On Earth, this is a species with a more complex story.The pine that we see across Scotland is actually of two distinct genetic lineages and was brought to our shores by humans. One was brought by the Celts from the Iberian peninsula, the other by people from Ukraine.These two populations of Scots pines remain, thousands of years on, genetically distinct, and also separate in distribution.The pines brought here from the Iberian peninsula cover the landscape to the west of Loch Ness, those from the Ukraine occupy the east of that line.One of the reasons Rawlence finds them so interesting, he says, is because they are part of a much wider story, which he tells, of how humans and trees have long been interlinked.“What I hope people take away, overall, is that the way that the boreal has evolved in lots of dferent places is contingent upon humans. It has always been. We have always been entangled with its destiny. We have co-evolved together. And that’s just as true for the larch as it is for the spruce as it is for the Scots pine or the birch. The reindeer grazing create the conditions for the birch. It’s all interlinked.”He tells the story of six key species which form the treeline, Scots pine, birch, larch, spruce, poplar and rowan, and how climate change is impacting not just their distribution but the lives of the people who have lived for millennia alongside them.But it’s the Scots pine I most want to talk with him about. I’ve long been a lover myself of the tree – the way its branches stretch their needles this way and that seeking out the sun, throwing expressive shapes. I can remember the realisation that this tree that cloaked the edge of Scottish lochs, was the same that filled the air with pine scent between holiday campsite and beach in France.That was an early glimmering that this tree we call Scots may not be ours, later confirmed when a Swedish friend Jannica Honey talked to me for my book, For The Love Of Trees, about a pine she called simply the Tall, which, when she found it here, would remind her of home. The tree we call Scots has many homes, and many peoples have a relationship with it.You only have to go back around  years to find a history in which Scots pine is arriving as an invasive species, brought here from the Iberian peninsula and Ukraine. The name tells us little about where it really came from, and more about the colonising role that Britain had in global history.As Rawlence puts it, “All of this stuff is tangled up with everything  – the dominance of Britain and colonialism how we see and name things.”Research into genetics and archaeology has uncovered these stories of the tree’s past.: Fellowship of the rings: Why we must protect our ancient trees“The provenance,” says Rawlence, “of the western group of Scots pine is quite well established. They were brought from Iberia by Celts moving up the river estuaries. There’s quite a strong archaeological record of the pines moving up the west coast of Britain and then spreading into Caledonia on time scales which were much faster than they would have been had they been regenerating naturally. The only plausible explanation is that they were brought by humans.”The Celts from Iberia were, he says, effectively travelling “with their own habitat, the pine”, the tree that provided them with food and other resources, with flour even, which could be made from its bark. Meanwhile, people from Ukraine, where a refugium of Scots pines had lingered since the previous Ice Age were also taking their special tree with them. Recent research has shown that the eastern population of Scottish pines is genetically very similar to those pines. Again, it was people who brought the tree, as they migrated across to the Sami territories of Norway and then over the North Sea to Scotland.The tree and the people have both left their mark on the Scotland of today and its gene pools. The red hair of the Ukrainian migrants, and the black of the Celts, exist alongside the trees that they brought with them. Rawlence says that we even find traces of this migration in folklore and oral history. When he mentioned his reearch to ethnobotanist Diana Beresford- Kroeger, she immediately connected it to Celtic stories which tell of how Iberians met the Ukrainians somewhere near John O’Groats coming the other way. “There is a popular word for people of the Danube who had red hair that comes from this encounter. Those two pieces of historical evidence together with the oral history, are a lovely discovery,” he says.When we think about restoring the lost forests of Scotland, often it’s the native pine forest we imagine. But, had these people not brought the pine with them, we might be looking at a very dferent Scotland, with uplands covered with oak woodland. How does that knowledge, affect what kind of forest we might want to regenerate now Rawlence is keen that we don’t write humans, who, as he says, have co-evolved with trees, out of both nature’s history and its future. “I applaud the rewilding efforts, the efforts to recover nature,” he says. “But it’s worth remembering that humans were always there. And the sustainability of those efforts and those landscapes is going to be contingent upon some kind of human interaction – whether that’s farming, new kinds of wildle tourism, a hunting economy. We have to have a relationship and an entanglement with it. And hopefully these efforts should also be tied to social justice and access for everybody.”He touches on an important debate, in these times of increasing rewilding. We might ask ourselves what the aims of rewilding really are  What are we trying to restore, and in a time when, due to climate change, the conditions are set to change anyway “This is the central tension that I was trying to get to in the chapter on Scotland,” Rawlence says. “Both sides of the rewilding debate are looking back. You’ve got the existing conservation economy saying it was never like that. You’ve got the rewilding utopianism of a kind of pristine boreal forest, which we know by  years ago was already gone in the British Isles. Both of their claims, those dferent claims to the past, are incomplete.”It was his attempt to follow the boreal treeline – the northern line that winds across altitude and latitude and is the limits of where trees will grow – that brought Rawlence to the north of Scotland and the story of the Scots pine. Rawlence, who is not an ecologist, but a former Human Rights Watch researcher and political speechwriter, who has, in Wales, set up an education institution to teach “creative and adaptive thinking” called Black Mountains College. He started to look at this treeline zone when he was on the hunt for a good new subject following his book on Somali refugees, City of Thorns: Nine Lives in the World’s Largest Refugee Camp.“The Horn of Africa,” he says, “is a very sensitive area, just like the Arctic. Historically it has had a very stable, very narrow temperature range, with monsoons and very delicate climate patterns which are finely calibrated, which were being disrupted.” What he noticed was that all the “displacement issues, the conflict and the human rights issues” he was covering were connected to and driven by this “underlying change”.“I thought, well, the next thing I want to do is not just go somewhere cold but look at another place where climate change is visible. If we’re going to talk about climate change and we’re going to interrogate what it means, why don’t we go and look at the places where it’s been happening for a long time.”He went in search of a storyline, a way of communicating the enormous topic of climate, something that would enable him to talk about the way we need to “start thinking about our relationship with the non-human world, with other species.”In the treeline he found a story which touched on the lives of indigenous peoples, impacted by climate change, but in which trees were the chief protagonist. For the treeline, he observes, has been on the march. “They’ve been moving since World War One,” he notes.It’s a movement that in many other parts of the world is visible, and noticeable to those who live there. But not here, in Scotland, where, Rawlence says, “you’re not seeing the march because you don’t have the trees. They are gone. There’s only a tiny fraction left. Here in Britain we have been highly successful at annihilating our forest. We’ve got  percent tree cover which is the lowest number in Europe. We have annihilated our ancient woodlands, perhaps more than any other country on earth. Research has shown we are one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world.”Rawlence believes that it’s no coincidence that Britain which “was the driver of the industrial revolution, a pioneer of capitalism, and property rights and enclosure and clearances” has suffered such extraordinary nature depletion. One of the books he cites as having had a profound influence on him, when he read it  years ago, was John Prebble’s The Highland Clearances.“We’ve absolutely written the text book on how to drive nature to the brink in the service of profit. Wales and Scotland and Ireland, are all particularly interesting examples of that. Because the patterns of colonialism and exploitation are written in the landscape.”One of his first chapters revolves around his search for the treeline in Scotland. What’s notable about it is that it seems like the pursuit of some elusive phantom. We have over centuries so stripped our landscape of trees that we no longer know where they might grow, what their limits might be, but nevertheless, Rawlence went hunting for the Cairngorms’ very highest trees.What he was directed to by ecologists, was, he says, not exactly the treeline, but just the place that was the closest approximation to it. “They’ve got a competition going now to see who can geolocate the highest trees in the Cairngorms, amongst the Cairngorms Connect.”In theory, Rawlence says, “Scotland is on the boreal treeline”. We were formerly a “boreal nation” like some of our neighbours. “All of the species in Scotland are continuous with Norway and Russia and it’s exactly the same historical process and exactly the same band of climate niche for those boreal species. But nobody knows where the treeline is because the trees are gone. You don’t see the march.”This means that there’s a sign here that we are not seeing. “When you lose an intact ecosystem, you lose your early warning system. You lose your map of the territory. You lose your guide.”A combination of factors mean that we are not seeing the change. One is that many species are long gone, the other is that, Rawlence describes, we don’t have indigenous communities living so closely with nature as there are in other countries. “They notice for example in Russia that there’s a new grass on the block in the Taiga. They notice that there’s a new butterfly that nobody knows the name for. Whereas in Scotland the most sensitive species to climate change are probably already gone  years ago,  years ago. That’s why we don’t see it. It’s because it’s already gone and we don’t know what we’re looking for and we’ve lost.”Often it’s said that our landscapes are missing key species, the lynx, the wolf, the bear, the beaver, many of these so long gone that it’s hard to imagine the country with them. But it’s also, as Rawlence observes, we are missing humans living closely with the landscape.There are other losses too. We don’t have the kind of indigenous knowledge that Rawlence found in some of the other communities he visited along the treeline. “Our indigenous knowledge is very very lost,” he says. “There are little echoes and tremors and traces of it. But it’s been systematically destroyed through superstition and Christian hegemony for a thousand years. You find it in crackpots and the weirdo books in the funny bookshops. It’s also in the language. It’s in Welsh. It’s in Gaelic.”As we face the prospect of a climate crisis, we might want to dig deeper into the past. Knowing the factors that made that past unfold as it did, he says, is vital. “If you understand better the contingency of the past, then the future becomes mutable. It becomes possible. It becomes something you can change, rather than this horrible place of powerlessness and denial where the only response to climate change is to run away or to bury your head in the sand, or be cynical.”Meanwhile, the treeline remains elusive in Scotland. Is it here, or is it not  Might we, through regeneration, find where it should be  “What’s exciting about Scotland is thatyou take the overgrazing out of the picture then you’ll see what’s going to happen and where the treeline is. It might be already above the top of the mountains.” A key aim of Cairngorms Connect is to allow trees to re-establish up to the natural treeline.Perhaps, he even suggests the whole of the Cairngorms were once entirely covered with forest. Cairn gorm is Gaelic for ‘blue mountains’, and he theorises perhaps this is because of the blue-green of the pines.One of the messages of The Treeline is that we are going to have to soon face a future where the climate is dferent. For Rawlence is fairly sure that we are on that trajectory towards  degrees, not the . degrees that was the fragile goal of COP.“- percent of scientists agree that . degrees is impossible,” he says. “When I started this research  years ago, it might have been argued that . degrees was in reach, but there’s now the reality of physics to contend with. And the other reality which has been a feature in my le is the reality of politics and I just know that the system is not going to sht that fast. So evenphysically it was possible, politically I know the hard limits of where we are and I despair of the ability to sht.”Rawlence’s despair at politics partly comes from his experience of working within it. In the run up to the Iraq war, he was a speechwriter for Charles Kennedy and lead for the Liberal Democrats for the campaign against that war.: Rewild Scotland: \"Beavers in all rivers. Lynx and wolf back.”“I used to wake up,” he recalls, “with nightmares about Tony Blair, frustrated with the fact we could win the argument and popular opinion, and yet with oil and the US and [President] Bush it’s happening and there’s nothing you can do. I had a very visceral experience of the unresponsiveness of the democratic system. I saw how fossil capital was hardwired into the system. Not just fossil capital but capital more broadly, and that you cannot extricate capital from its principal energy source. Without fossil fuels it doesn’t work.”He places little hope in the processes of international summits like COP. He calls the over-focussing on emissions “carbon reductionism” and dismisses net zero as a “dangerous delusion”.“I think hopefully what the book shows you is that nature is really complicated, that carbon is a system that’s in flux all the time, with enormous volatility. If you want to use the econometric metaphor like net zero, then you have to acknowledge that this is  accounting.”Nature, he says, is “supremely complicated”. It’s those communities he features in the books who live closely with it that understand it best.Rawlence has uncovered a fascinating story about the history of the Scots pine in Scotland, but what about its future  There, what he has found is not nearly so lovely. Startlingly, he notes that climate change may mean that it disappears from our landscape. This is a prediction he came across in ious scientic papers, which to him felt “earthshattering”, but which he noted was not “front page news”, nor had it even really been explored by journalists.He first noticed mention of the possibility in an RSPB handbook to Abernethy forest and that referenced models from the Met Office and University of Oregon which talked about climate velocity and the survivability of Scots pines at ious latitudes. “It didn’t take much,” he says, “to join the dots and say thatthey were gone at  degrees north and we’re at , that means that they’re gone.”“It sounds shocking and it might not arrive on the timescales that the models predict, but at some point in the next centurythe warming trajectory continues as at present and we get to C in the next decade and C by , then yes it does mean that there won’t be any more Scots pines in Scotland.“That’s a terrible thought. But hopefully that will give people pause and they will start to engage more with not just rewilding, but nature recovery and strategic ecology and thinking more broadly about our landscape and how we relate to it and what we need from it.”The Treeline: The Last Forest and the Future of Le on Earth by Ben Rawlence is published by Jonathan Cape"},{"url":null,"title":"scots-pines-disappear-scotland-due-climate-change","story":"In an in-depth interview, Ben Rawlence said he came across this prediction, which he regards as \"earthshattering\" in a couple of dfferent papers which modelled the impact of climate change on the tree.  One was created by the University of Oregon, the other the Met Office. “It didn’t take much,” he said, “to join the dots and say thatthey were gone at  degrees north and we’re at  degrees north, that means that they’re gone.”READ FULL INTERVIEW HERE: Both sides of rewilding debate are wrong, says authorThe Met office paper predicted that, in Europe, the tree will be confined to areas of Fennoscandia, Russia and the Alps.  “It sounds shocking,\" he said, \"and it might not arrive on the timescales that the models predict, but at some point in the next centurythe warming trajectory continues as at present and we get to C in the next decade and C by , then yes it does mean that there won’t be any more Scots pines in Scotland.\" “That’s a terrible thought,\" he added. \"But hopefully that will give people pause and they will start to engage more with not just rewilding, but nature recovery and strategic ecology and thinking more broadly about our landscape and how we relate to it and what we need from it.”: Fellowship of the rings: Why we must protect our ancient trees Subscribe now for the latest arts TV nostalgia features environmental news and opinion letters from just £ by clicking here"},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-nicola-sturgeon-say-today-face-masks-working-home","story":"The final restrictions that were put in place in response to the Omicron iant were removed on Monday, January .In an update last week the First Minister announced that nightclubs would be able to reopen, and caps on indoor events and table service requirements where alcohol is served would be removed.These measures were put in place in December, alongside a maximum capacity of  people for outdoor events.

Critical to this is the creation of a fabrication supply chain.As a first step, the STUC asks the First Minister to convene a major summit of successful bidders to begin the process of planning for a supply chain revolution in Scotland.Scotland gains from the Crown Estates Scotland auction of the seabed plots around the Scottish coast, netting a one-off £m. Its profits are given to the Scottish Treasury or split between some local authorities.Based on proposed project rents outlined by seabed managers Crown Estates Scotland, it was revealed that the ScotWind projects operating at its full capacity would be estimated to bring Scotland between £m and £m each year - a tiny fraction of the billions expected in profits.While the total impact on the associated supply chain and on the number of jobs created will not be known until later in the process, the First Minister said their estimates suggest as much as £ billion could be generated for every gigawatt of power. A gigawatt equates to roughly two coal-fired power plants and is enough to power , homes in Britain.Some believe the Scottish supply chain spin off is an “overpromise” with current bids currently excluding any firm commitments.Scottish energy secretary Michael Matheson last week failed to answer whether there would be any specic, binding commitments for winning bidders to deliver investment and jobs in Scotland, after being urged to make sure the benefits are not “squandered”.STUC general secretary Roz Foyer said: “Rarely has the phrase, ‘we wouldn’t have started from here,’ been more relevant than it is for the ScotWind leasing round. We should not be reliant on overseas private companies to deliver the jobs we need. More profits should be coming to Scotland to be invested in our future.“However, it is not too late for government to intervene through ownership, investment and conditionality.“We heard plenty of encouraging noises from corporations in the run up to the ScotWind announcement, now we begin the process of turning those promises into reality.”The Common Weal think tank says that a lack of manufacturing capacity in Scotland means that supply chain promises may not be forthcomingcompanies believe it is cheaper to import material rather than invest in Scotland.Last year the Herald on Sunday revealed that Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the Scottish Governments economic development agency faced the loss of up to £.m of taxpayers money through the collapse of offshore wind tower firm CS Wind, the only UK facility for manufacturing onshore and offshore wind towers and seen as a key part of Scotlands green revolution.Common Weal has long advocated the establishment of a state-owned company which would have owned energy resources, to provide secure, reliable and low-cost retail energy to households and to ensure there were renewable energy supply chain and manufacturing jobs for Scotland.Nicola Sturgeon said in  that the Scottish Government planned to set up a state-owned energy company in Scotland which was due to be established last year but was dropped in September."},{"url":null,"title":"lily-douglas-st-johnstone-hold-14th-minute-applause-late-fan","story":"Young St Johnstone fan Lily Douglas sadly passed away on Sunday after a long battle with Ewing Sarcoma - a rare type of cancer that affects bones or the tissue around bones.The -year-old had been fighting the disease since being diagnosed in , and her mother announced the tragic news on her social media pages on Sunday Evening.Lily had a passion for dancing and had previously performed at a half-time show with her dance troop at McDiarmid Park and loved going to the games.The Perth club announced they would be paying their respects to her in tomorrow evenings home match against Dundee, by asking fans to join in with a minutes applause in the th minute.Young Lily Douglas tragically passed away recently and as such we would like to pay tribute to her.Can every fan attending tomorrow join us in a minute’s applause to honour her le on the th minuteR.I.P Lily Douglas 💙A statement on the clubs website said: \"Lily Douglas was a brave young woman you tragically passed away recently.Everyone at the club would like to pass on their condolences to Lilys family.

She#s in Cruickston # there is quite a big estate there and when I went for a walk there, I came across a park almost every minute of the walk. I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sanas-Padlet-266-x-150-mm-1.jpg","title":"dreuchd ur ann an","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATURE: NEW YEAR, NEW CAREERAig an àm seo den bhliadhna, bidh sinn tric a’ smaoineachadh air ar dreuchdan atharrachadh agus mar sin is dòcha gum bi an goireas ùr aig Bòrd na Gàidhlig feumail dhuibh ma tha sibh a’ beachdachadh air dreuchd ùr ann an teagasg tro mheadhan na Gàidhlig.’S e goireas didseatach a th’ ann am padlet far a bheil làraich-lìn, sgrìobhainnean agus bhideothan air an cruinneachadh air balla.

CCEA has made it very clear that examiner judgement and not an algorithm will be at the heart of the awarding process this year.“Obviously, algorithm became quite a thing a couple of years ago and it’s certainly something that we wouldn’t be looking towards this year. So examiner’s I understand will be taking account of the disruption which has been faced by our students, just to ensure that any grades that they that they will receive will be higher than pre-pandemic year.”She said that her officials were working with civil servants in other departments across the UK on the issue of exams.She said it was important to “really ensure that our young people are not disadvantaged in any way particularly whenever they’re looking to gain either employment or to go on to third-level education.“If there is to be any change and there is to be the alternative awarding it will be similar to .”According to the latest figures from the Department of Health, five further people who had previously tested positive for Covid- have died in Northern Ireland.Another , confirmed cases of the virus have also been notied in the last -hour reporting period.On Tuesday morning, there were  Covid- inpatients in hospital,  of whom were being treated in ICUs.Most ReadFionntan McGarvey ‘lit up the sky with his smile’, funeral of tragic GAA player toldOur ‘simple’ le – Jamie Dornan’s we Amelia Warner on keeping things normalDoug Beattie’s tweets: What he said then and his explanations nowI’ve finally found love again, reveals NI granddaughter of film legend Charlie ChaplinEdwin Poots issues defamation proceedings against Doug Beattie and Tory MP Simon Hoare over offensive tweet about his weTop VideosPlayDoug Beattie apologises for tweeting #joke# about DUP minister#s wePlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayInterview: Doug Beattie implores people not to judge him by his pastLatest Northern IrelandUlster Unionist Party stands by leader Beattie left #broken# by tweets stormDUP minister seeks Stormont Executive approval for continuing NI Protocol checksMan arrested in Mark Hall murder probeEngaged Belfast couple appeal for help to find missing ringBelfast woman who missed grandad’s last birthday ‘disgusted’ by Johnson party revelationsLatestYouTuber who defamed Cardi B ordered to pay rapper further £ millionWhat the papers say – January Tycoon facing extradition to USA waits for ruling in latest stage of legal fightAlicia Witt pays tribute to late parents as ‘beautully original souls’Orange Is The New Black and Seinfield actress Kathryn Kates dies,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

is expected to start shortly on a major internal upgrade at Ballynahinch Community Centre.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has drawn up plans to reconfigure the internal layout of the Windmill Street facility as part of a signicant investment initiative.Local people are being asked for their views on the planned upgrade which could be completed as early as the summer and cost in the region of pound,.Confirmation that work is to start soon on the centre upgrade has been welcomed by Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen, who has also thanked Strangford MP Jim Shannon and her council colleague Billy Walker for their support in driving the renovation programme forward.She revealed that she had been contacted by a number of residents about the slow progress of the scheme and is pleased that everything is now on track.In addition to the planned work at the community centre, consideration is also being given to investing around pound, to finance internal alterations of the local authority-owned Market House in the town centre.And the Recorder understands that consideration is being given to providing an ultra-modern G sports pitch at the Langley Road playing fields with the adjoining sports pavilion also in line for a major upgradeA number of politicians have been lobbying for the local authority to address what they described as the organisationrsquos ldquounder investment in Ballynahinch and ensure that enhancing leisure facilities is a critical component of its future investment plans.Council officials had previously been asked to examine the potential of extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.However, they have opted to commit pound, on a major upgrade of the existing complex which will include a reconfiguration of the internal floorspace in a bid to increase the buildingrsquos usage.Politicians say they are keen to work in partnership with council officials and the Ballynahinch Community Collective to improve sports and community provision in the town to meet the needs of a wide range of people.Elected representatives say Ballynahinch needs to be at the heart of planned investment in future leisure provision across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.Politicians are keen to ensure that Ballynahinch does not miss out when it comes to leisure provision investment, given the money that has already spent in other towns across the council area.They believe that the good working relationship that exists between elected representatives across the Rowallane area can ensure that Ballynahinch does not miss out on future funding opportunitiesand that the needs of the townrsquos community are met, particularly when it comes to modern leisure, sports and community provision.Politicians want Ballynahinch to be included in any future strategy when it comes to leisure activities and provision, warning that the town cannot afford be left behind.They say the current community centre requires a much-needed upgrade with the current proposal a major step in the right direction.Elected representatives say that given the local council spend on major schemes in other parts of the district, the ratepayers of Ballynahinch deserve nothing less than an upgrade community

And as well as their cultural signicance the implications for the economic and tourism attraction of the historic centre of the county are obvious.They add: ldquoWe call on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to halt its current direction of travel and demonstrate a commitment to restoring what was an internationally recognised centre of excellence in Downpatrick.ldquoWe ask it to respect its moral responsibility to honour the trust placed in the museum by those thousands of donors and friends who expected the council to cherish and support this public treasure house of the shared histories of County Down.Last week a spokesperson for the council said it was ldquocommitted to the continuous improvement and development of its museums.The spokesperson also said a meeting was held in December with stakeholders and elected representatives to clary there would be a reduction in ldquostaff head count following the restructuring.ldquoFurther engagement with stakeholders is planned for early this year and we look forward to working with all our partners to advance the councilrsquos ambitious and exciting plans for our museum services, the spokesperson added.See Letters on pages  and ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19_January2022_Down.jpg","title":"Down go under against Antrim  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo disappointing start to their Dr McKenna Cup campaign continued when they lost out to Antrim by two points in Newry last week.The defeat means back-to-back losses for James McCartanrsquos new-look side, despite some encouraging inidual performances throughout from the Mourne outfit.Down will count themselves unlucky not to gain anything from the contest, having gone tit for tat with the Saffrons in the first half and Barry OrsquoHagan seeing his last gasp goal bound effort ricocheting over the bar instead of hitting the back of the net.McCartanrsquos men got off to a dream start when the newly ed Niall McParland sent a long ball forward into the hands of Ryan OrsquoHiggins, who opened the scoring through a well struck goal just three minutes in.Ruairi McCann and Odhran Eastwood confidently kicked over frees to bring Antrim within one point of levelling the scores before Packie OrsquoHagan doubled Downrsquos lead just before the  minute mark.Antrim did manage to completely reduce the deficit before the first water-break, with two quick-fire scores coming from Patrick McBride and a Pat Shivers free.As the players rehydrated, the surrounding supporters at Pairc Esler were awarded time to catch their breath as the fast paced game was momentarily brought to a halt.Veteran Darren OrsquoHagan entered the fray in the place of John McGeough upon the resumption before James Laverty kicked over a point from play to give the visitors the lead for the first time in the match.A well worked attack ended with Kevin McKernan levelling proceedings once again for the hosts, and soon after captain Caolan Mooney fired over between the sticks to give his side the advantage.Things began heating up in the cold weather, with plenty of firm challenges on show.Anytime the Mourne side were edging ahead, Antrim were right on their coattails and were now starting to overpower the home side in dferent areas of the pitch.Antrimrsquos McCann kicked over two unanswered points, the first from a rsquorsquo and the second from a free, although Downrsquos sharpshooting Barry OrsquoHagan restored parity in a matter of seconds.With three minutes to the interval, McCann converted his fourth free of the night to give the Saffrons a one point lead.Half time: Down - Antrim -.Down boss McCartan made his second change of the night in the form of Ross Carr swapping out Josh Connery to help give his county a dferent option at the back, although they conceded their first goal of the contest a minute into the restart.Patrick McBride duly converted a fisted effort past Downrsquos Rory Burns after Antrim team-mate Jamie McCann powered his way through the home defence.Down responded positively, splitting the sticks three times unanswered with scores from a Barry OrsquoHagan free and a brace of points from play through McKernan and Darren OrsquoHagan.After over ten minutes without a score on the board, Antrim finally kicked over the bar through Michael McCann.Causing further problems for Down, McCann proved important at both sides of the pitch when he managed to catch lsquokeeper Burnsrsquo attempted rsquo to rule out any chance of a goal.At the second water-break, the home side trailed by two with it all still to play for as both sides made changes.Barry OrsquoHagan took the mark and knocked over a brace of frees to level the scores but once again, Antrim would not be deterred and replied with a point from play by substitute Conor Murray.As the clock ticked down the next few scores would be vital in deciding the outcome and unfortunately for the home support they wouldnrsquot be given much more to cheer about.With two minutes of regulation time to go, Patrick McBride struck over what looked like an insurance point for the Saffrons.As the official announced three minutes of added time, Down pressed high in search of that crucial goal to share the points.With one last opportunity awarded to Down in the form of a free, Barry OrsquoHagan stepped up to fire his effort towards the net.However, the ball would have to travel past a sea of Antrim bodies that had smartly piled across the goal line.Agonisingly, OrsquoHaganrsquos effort smashed off the opposing Antrim wall of defence before clipping the crossbar on its way over to give the visitors a dramatic victory.Down: R Burns P Fegan, B McArdle, G Collins J Connery, N McParland, J McGeough A Doherty, L Middleton R OrsquoHiggins , C Mooney , C OrsquoRawe B OrsquoHagan , P OrsquoHagan , K McKernan Subs: D OrsquoHaganfor McGeough, R Carr for Connery, T Prenter for P OrsquoHagan.

So far the youths have engaged in wanton vandalism of ious areas of the village including putting dog faeces through letter boxes and damaging the villagersquos Christmas tree and festive lights last month.The RUC says it is vital that members of the public provide information which will bring an end of the vandalism problem.ldquoWe need the help of the community to bring those responsible to court, and without that help it will be very dficult to put an end to this problem, he said.BALLYNAHINCH ndash Management at the GPT telecommunications plant in Ballynahinch have pledged to work towards ensuring that it continues to have a future following the weekend announcement of  redundancies.The company, which manufactures hi-tech switching equipment for the telecommunications industry, revealed on Friday that it is to slice its workforce by more than half.The job losses will reduce the workforce at the Antrim Road plant to .

The only good news is that we will not be closing and are hoping that a leaner and fitter plant can be a springboard for the future, said Mr OrsquoNeill.DRUMANESS ndash Around forty villagers from Drumaness rolled up their sleeves on Sunday to give the local mill pond a much-needed clean-up.The Friends of Drumaness Dam group pulled a large quantity of rubbish out of the pond in the first of a series of work days aimed at improving the area.Fallen branches which had been washed into the dam were removed with the aid of ropes, while rubbish dumped in the centre of the pond was removed by boat. The branches were burnt on a bonfire, and all plastic collected was taken to Drumnakelly dump for safe disposal.Among the workers who took part in the work day was Mrs Sheila Lewis-Crosby, who along with her husband John is the owner of the mill pond. She and Drumaness woman Mrs Carmel Mason cleared brambles constructing a path alongside the dam.After the clean-up, the secretary of the Friends of Drumaness, Dam Lisa Fagan, congratulated the volunteers and thanked local councillor Patsy Toman for initiating the venture.ldquoThe Drumaness people can be proud of our achievement here today, she said. ldquoThere is no doubt that the whole community is sickened by these incidents, he added.DOWNPATRICK ndash People who take part in the after-dark practice of ldquolamping rabbits have this week been warned they are placing themselves in danger.The RUC has warned that people who dress up in combat clothing and walk around fields hunting rabbits with firearms could find themselves being confronted by a security force patrol.Over the Christmas and New Year period, the RUC received reports of ldquolamping in the Downpatrick and Crossgar areas and it also believed to have occurred around Saintfield.The practice has been a problem in the Castlewellan area for a number of years but it is relatively unknown in east Down.It involves hunters going into fields without farmersrsquo permission and shooting rabbits by torchlight.

It is incredible that the Conservative Party is so mishandling the local economy that a scheme of such major importance to Comber and the outlying areas can be postponed to a date four years from now, Mr Taylor said this week.ldquoThe Minister met myself and a delegation of Ards Borough councillors last year and he agreed that Comber by-pass was a priority scheme Now he has shelved it for four years.ldquoI can understand slippage of a few months due to existing schemes costing more than has already been planned but a four year delay is out of the question.Mr Taylor said he has spoken to local members of his partyrsquos Comber branch and they are ldquohorried at the decision.BISHOPSCOURT ndash A total of around  local residents have signed a petition opposing proposals to turn the former Bishopscourt airfield into a motor-race track.The petition organisers say they are delighted by the response which indicates a ldquothumbs-down by the majority of people living in the area.ldquoThe residents all live in the immediate vicinity of the airfield or along the Downpatrick to Ballyhornan road, and so are the people most likely to be affectedthe planned track were to go ahead, explained a spokesman this week.The residents say they are concerned at proposals, currently with the Planning Service in Downpatrick, to turn part of the former air base at Ballyhornan into a race track.A spokesman said the petition is to be sent to the planning authorities and to the Minister for the Environment, Mr Richard Needham, this week.

All statutory consultees bar one have now given the proposal their approval, with discussions with the final consultee in progress.Association officials say the planning application covers only the paths, pond, fencing and information  associated with the field close to the community centre.ldquoMany hours have been put in completing the application to the Heritage Fund which was submitted at the end of November with a decision due in March, Saintfield News confirms, explaining thatthe bid is successful, it will be for the development phase of the project.ldquoThis will probably take one year and will include detailed measurements of the scheduled monument buildings, work plans, costings for stabilising these and obtaining scheduled monument consent and planning approval for these works.ldquoAt the end of this development phase a further application to the Heritage Fund would be made for the delivery phase of the project. ldquoThe association says thatthis was successful and all went well, the park and windmill would be opened to the public in the spring of .However,the Heritage Fund application is unsuccessful, the association will proceed with the proposal, but the work would exclude the scheduled monument area.ldquoThis would be fenced off as unsafe and left as is, reports Saintfield News. ldquoCompetition for Heritage Fund grants is very competitive and many other projects in Northern Ireland will be applying.

Most of his career was spent preparing for defence against “a Russian style or former soviet style enemy”.He says the Russian naval test off Irish waters - combined with other Russian exercises around the globe at the same time - are designed to spread western military intelligence resources as thinly as possible while Russiafocuses on its objectives in the Ukraine.“They are doing it to expose an unprotected flank of NATO, through [the Republic of] Ireland as Russia knows Ireland does not have the ability to defend itself. It is making a very clear statement.”The exercise is located over the site of many of the EU’s transatlantic communication cables, which Russia knows how to tap for information, he adds.”Russia is reasserting its position and the timing is to split the UK, US and NATO surveillance abilities as it is doing so many similar exercises around the globe at the same time.”He iscertain it is all linked to what Russia is trying to achieve in Ukraine.“The Republic of Ireland’s military capabilities are completely useless in this environment. They do not have the ability from an intelligence view to monitor Russian movement around the Irish coast. Russian missile submarines spend a lot of time off the west coast of Ireland and the Republic does not have the ability to see, stop or disrupt this.“That is why when it comes to the protection of Irish air space they rely on the RAF to do so. There is an agreement in place between the Republic of Ireland and the UK for the RAF to provide that air cover.“There are similar arrangements in place with the Royal Navy. The Republic of Ireland does not pay for this protection but it is also protecting the UK’s flank, he notes.“This is where Northern Ireland is critical to the defence of the UK, from a geographic position, in being able to give it a foothold and extra reach out into the Atlantic.”The strategic position of NI for the defence of the UK is something that will “always be a consideration” to the UK government should there be a border poll, he adds.He believes Russia will invade Ukraine.“I personally think yes, they will.”The motivation is that Ukraine has been moving closer ideologically to the EU and Russia is afraid of it becoming part of NATO.Russia is exploitingthe Republic of Ireland, he says, because it cannot monitor its own waters or airspace and has weak immigration controls, so it presents a weak flank of NATO.“The Republic presents a focal point for Russian or other malign actors to either get into the EU or penetrate into the UK and wider NATO by getting intelligence agents into Ireland and therefore into the EU.”Weak passport controls allow Russian agents to enter the UK via the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, he says. Agents will also move from the Republic into France and the rest of the EU, especially on a  passport.“For many years intelligence agents around the world saw an Irish passport as the ‘go to’ second passport that intelligence agents had.People from so many parts of the world now hold Irish passports legitimately, he says, so it is a good cover.“It was always seen as a relatively easy place to get a legitimate passport from.”ButRussian agents inside NI are also “%” also an issue right now, he says.“They will be interested in any defence industries, military bases, shipyards. They will also be looking at anything they can do to disrupt normal government activity both north and south.”One example of this could be through dis-and-misinformation - for example stimulating support for a border poll, or support for loyalist or republican terrorist organisations, he says.“If they feel that it undermines Westminster or Dublin or the EU’s focus away from Russian activities, Russia will put its kne in that crack and wiggle it away as much aspossible.”Russian agents will also be likely to try and exacerbate any social grievances which might result in street protests, “at the very least through social media” he adds.Russian agents in NI are likely to speak without any accent and hold non-Russian passports. Traditionally their cover story is working as junior embassy staff, business executives or journalists.Their preferred agents to recruit may have roles such as engineers or computer experts in sensitivebusinesses or industries.Russian intelligence officers will “%” have people inside NI political parties and may fund political activities from front companies, he adds. The agents these officers run will also be locals who they recruit inside defence manufacturers in NI, for example.Russia had close links with Libya when it was supplying shiploads of mainly Soviet weaponry to the IRA, he notes.“They will be interested in exacerbating political conflict. That will be a definite aim of Russian intelligence services because it splits political thinking in Westminster and fixes it onto something , which then can’t be spent on supporting NATO, the EU or looking at the Russian threat.”They will be aiming to do this from both sides of the political spectrum at the same time in NI, he says, as well as in the south.As to spotting agents, he advises, “If you have a gut feeling something is wrong there could well be something wrong. So MI have got a hotline numberpeople are concerned about anything.”There are more Russian intelligenceofficers in the UK now than during the height of the ColdWar, he says, which would have been “several hundred” at that time.UUP MLA and former Royal Navy submarine commanderSteve Aiken says the exercise off the coast of Cork is the Russians “making very clear to NATO but more importantly to the EU that they can signicantly disrupt business and trade the economies of Europe”.The giveaway, he says, is that they are exercising above a number of keytransatlantic communication cables.”They are demonstrating their capability, bearing in mind that NATO are sending their standing forces into the Black Sea at the moment That would be seen by the Russians as a direct provocation to their intentions in the Ukraine.“But by carrying out exercises in the Atlantic, Mediterraneanand Arctic at the same time, the Russians are demonstrating their capability to be able to inflict as much damage to Europe as NATO could do to Russia.”The Republic of Ireland has acknowledged that it “can’t do anything” about the Russian exercises off its coast, he says.“This is particularlytrue as the Irish have no maritime or air capability whatsoever [in proportion to this threat]. I think the Russians are just demonstrating they can operate with impunity.“I would say it would be extraordinarily embarrassing when Simon Coveney calls in the Russian ambassadorto complain about something - but what is he going to do about it  He has no air capability and no maritime capability.”In the event of a threat to the Irish Republic from something such as a hijacked aircraft, he says, “they would have to call up the RAF to come and deal with it. They have no capability at all.”The Republic of Ireland only has radar around its airports but has no means to detect hostile aircraft around its coast or anywhere , he says.“They are quite unique in European terms in their limited military capability, aside from Malta. Every other EU countryinvests quite considerably in its defence capabilities.”The defence question should be a signicant consideration for anyone voting in a border poll, he says.“Of course. To me that has always been the case.”The UK’s presence in Northern Ireland is critical in its defence plans, he says.“One of the reasons the UK has managed to maintain its security is because it always controlled the sea lanes and airspace around and over Ireland.”As to whether Russia will invade Ukraine, hesuggests: “We are in a stage where anything could happen.”MORE NEWS:Ex-PSNI Chief Constable Hugh Orde: The Historical Enquiries Team was closed down to protect terrorists-turned-politiciansPSNI dodges ex-chief constable George Hamilton’s claim about murder of ex-IRA man Kevin McGuiganPSNI assessment of IRA Army Council relationship with Sinn Fein remains unchanged says Chief Constable Simon ByrnePSNI reveals why Paramilitary Crime Task Force investigates UVF, UDA and INLA - but not the IRAYoung unionists react to BBC’s Stephen Nolan: Why our peers don’t want to speak out in the mediaA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I just mentioned I was fond of a cream bun on air one day and it just stuck.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I could have the weight of the world on my shoulders before my show - I’m not always chirpy, chirpy, chirpy all the time, but as soon as I am on air I forget about all my worries and am just in that moment of communication with my listeners.Hugo on his wedding day with Joan in . The couple have one daughter and four grandchildren“The same with anytime I go out on stage and pick up a microphone to sing. Those moments are magical to me.”The wee man from Strabane certainly has musical kudos.In the early s, he was spotted on a TV talent show on RTE and signed by the then fledgling Release Records, which later spawned such stars as Philomena Begley, Ray Lynam and Eurovision star Jonny Logan.By the time he was , he had formed his own band, Hugo Duncan and the Tall Men, and had a number one hit in the Irish charts with Dear God.Hugo and his only daughter Suzanne. The broadcaster says his family is his proudest achievement alongside singing, performing and broadcasting. Duncan says he is never happier than when he is on air and forgets all his personal troubles as soon as he begins his weekly show on BBC Radio UlsterThe ever popular broadcaster explains how his music career took off when the showband era was at its height. At first he could only play three or so chords on the guitar with a capo, but he didn’t let that deter him, and while muso bosses at first demurred at making him a frontman because of his diminutive stature, they eventually relented.“I used to sing on my own in bars in Strabane and all over, then I was gigging with a wee band all over the country for £ or £. a night. That was certainly a long time ago. “I remember I turned  on a Thursday, March ,  I was married the following Thursday and the following Thursday fortnight my mother Susie who raised me on her own died.Hugo having a lark at an outside broadcast pre-pandemic. During lockdown he most missed driving as he likes to travel all over the country from his native Strabane to Kerry, Waterford, Wexford and other parts of the Republic“A close friend of mine, Theo, was a presenter on Highland Radio, who was in a band called The Polka Dots who were managed by Barney Curley. I would say my voice is good, but I’m definitely no Mario Lanza. “The management team tried to oust me because I was small, five foot five . They wanted a traditional six foot frontman, but then they went with Hugo Duncan and The Tall Men, because my friend Pio McCann said to them, “Well, are you looking for a singer or a male model ’ And so I was signed up.He added: “When we had our hit with Dear God in the Irish charts we were walking on air. We lived for today and tomorrow would look after itself. We were at one point one of the top three bands in Ireland. “But then I got into the drink in a big way, from the early s until the  December , and I have not had an alcoholic drink since then, thank God. I just stick to Coca-Cola or orange juice, but I still love being in bars.”He met his we Joan, the love of his le, while they were both working at a nylon factory in Strabane and he credits her almost entirely with keeping him grounded.Hugo recalls: “I was backward about coming forwards on the matter. She used to work in the Gorey Cinema in Newtownstewart selling ice cream, but even when we were courtin’ she wouldn’t have given me a free one.“We were courtin’ from , for  months, then I was working a night sht and I was standing in the hallway of her own house to give her a good night kiss. “There was a song on the radio playing ‘I will never be married, I’ll be no man’s we’ and I just said ‘Will you marry me ’ And that was it. It all happened up against the coats.”A huge hit on the air waves, and particularly with an older demographic of listeners, although plenty of young country music fans tune in frequently too, he is sustained by his Christian faith.“I believe in God and I would pray every day, but I wouldn’t force my religion on anybody. “People say we are two communities here, but we both, Protestant and Catholic, have far more in common than what ides us. “We all bleed when we are cut, we all cry when we are hurt. “I love that my programme goes to every part of Northern Ireland and I think this mutual love of country music can bring us all together - everyone loves the best of country music old and new across Ulster.”‘I WANT TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY AS MUCH AS I CAN’“My new year’s resolutions are to broadcast as much as I can, sing as much as I can and make people happy as much as I can,” says Hugo, who does come across as one of the most cheery people you could meet and that palpable sense of bonhomie and banter and good craic is so apparent on the air waves that it’s no wonder his show is such a hit.He started out in radio after being offered a slot at a station based in Donegal.Hugo recalls: “I began on Donegal Radio and then moved to Radio Foyle, doing  minutes here a and there and then I got a show with Radio Ulster, initially on a Saturday night, and I began to say during a wee teaser ‘Now we’ll play a song for the children before they go to bed, so phone in and tell your Uncle Hugo what you would like to hear played.’ “And then that moniker just stuck with me.”Uncle Hugo, as he prefers to be known, joined Radio Foyle during the s doing holiday relief, after which he was offered a job presenting his own weekly show. In October , he began presenting on BBC Radio Ulster.UNCLE HUGO UP THERE WITH THE NEWS LETTER’S BILLY KENNEDY AS COUNTRY MUSIC CONNOISSEURThough a much-loved radio star, an adept performer and someone with a forensic knowledge of country music to rival the News Letter’s very own in-house expert Billy Kennedy, Hugo insists that his proudest achievement in le is without question his family.“My we Joan, my daughter Suzanne and my grandchildren are the lights of my le - absolutely. “But after that I love being able to sing and entertain and more than anything, from the soles of my feet to the very top of my scalp, to try to bring people joy. I just love trying to make people happy and seeing a smile on their faces. “Also, I once sang in the Royal Albert Hall, at Villanova University and in New York.“I love singing in and around Strabane, in Lford and where in Donegal because there’s a whole network of people I know very well there.“I have always lived in Strabane, I love Strabane and I intend to die in Strabane.”I ask him why he thinks the popularity of country music is so predominant across the province.“I think it’s because so many of a certain generation grew up in the showband era and a lot of them were popularising country music. “From the s on the showbands and country music were very much loved here.“The next generation of Irish country singers coming along like Derek Ryan and Nathan Carter and Lisa McHugh, things are much more dferent for them in that they’re so much more business and PR savvy but a lot of the time they are doing covers of older songs like stuff from Foster and Allen and all the older great country music stars - there are so many of them close to my heart that it’s virtually impossible to list them all.“Butyou’re chatting about Irish country music, then a hugely important artist, in my view, is Daniel O’Donnell. “He would get up and sing for ten people with as much dedication and enthusiasm as he would sing for , people, and whatever the size of the audience he holds them captive, just in the palm of his hand.“He’s honestly a lovely human being and in my view a top musical performer - one of my absolute favourites, in fact, and someone I deeply respect.”As a celebrity broadcaster Hugo could well get a big head, but he insists this is not the case.“But I do love when I go to supermarkets and people will meet me and ask for photographs and a chat and my we gets angry because I would really stop and chat with everybody, and she’d rather I just pushed the trolley as fast as I can,” he laughs.QA: ‘GOD BLESS LITTLE CHILDREN, WHILE THEY’RE TOO YOUNG TO HATE’Tell us some of your earliest childhood memories I grew up with just my mother Susie and I in a terrace house. There was always music and a welcome in our house and my wee mother used to say she was always singing that she was “always a bridesmaid and never a bride”.We were very close to our neighbours. In those days nobody locked their doors and I was always really well looked after. I would have went in there, say next door, and they would say ‘Come on in here, Hugh’ - never Hugo, ‘To get a cup of tea and a piece of bread and butter and that will do you until you get your dinner.’ And then my godmother was always making buns for me, and I was in and out of all the houses nearby on my street.Tell us about your school days I was never academic and I was always more drawn to music, especially once my mother bought me a band kit with Providence cheques, I was always singing and gigging about the place. I think I have a short attention span.I didn’t mind arithmetic, but once they got into all those equations and all, then I switched off. I hated PE and sports.What is the secret of your the longevity of your marriage Joan is the backbone of everything, and our daughter Suzanne arrived just a year after our marriage in . We now have four grandchildren, Jake, Ellie-Mae, Molly-Jay,and Katie-Sue. Things were tough when Suzanne had cancer but we got through it all and I really think my Joan is the one who holds all the family together - she has a very strong Christian faith.Tell us your favourite country music artists Tom T Hall, a real singer songwriter and story-teller, and I actually went to his home on two dferent occasions to interview him with a film crew. He wrote a song called Old Dogs and Children and Watermelon Wine and the line of the song that really hit me and spoke to me from the moment I heard it was ‘God bless little children, while they’re still too young to hate’. I also love George Jones, Merle Haggard, Buck Owen - all the old country singers.But I love all kinds of music and singing all kinds of songs. I appreciate traditional, jazz and lots of other genres, but country always comes first. What is your favourite way to spend a day I love driving, and being in transit. I used to do -k miles a year driving up and down Ireland, all over. From home to Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Wexford, Galway, almost every county. And I just love getting out and singing and performing with a band because the buzz you get from doing what you do on stage is second to none.Listen to Hugo Duncan on BBC Radio Ulster, Mondays to Fridays, from .pm."},{"url":null,"title":"covid  ni takes further step away from restrictions as rules change again ","story":"Protestants should not say sorry for abuse in Catholic establishments   Doug Beattie says sorry for Edwin Poots brothel ‘joke’NewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsPoliticsCovid-: NI takes further step away from restrictions as rules change againTomorrow will mark another step forward in the reopening of Northern Ireland as the ban on nightclubs is lted, and Covid passes are dispensed with by hospitality businesses.By Niall DeeneyTuesday, th January , : am  \"       \"  A barman in a Belfast pub ahead of a change to the rules around Covid certicationA series of restrictions will be lted tomorrow as part of what Health Minister Robin Swann has suggested could be the “beginning of the end” of the coronavirus pandemic here.The latest changes were agreed in a meeting of the Northern Ireland Executive on Thursday, and follow an earlier loosening of the rules on Friday.From January , the requirement to be seated whilst consuming food and or drink and for table service in premises that provide alcohol was removed, along with limit of six people at a table from dferent households.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Government guidance will continue to “strongly encourage their continued use”.Also changing tomorrow will be the requirement for offices to take “reasonable measures for m social distancing”. While that requirement will go, guidance remains in place that risk assessments should be carried out.Some of the few restrictions remaining in place after tomorrow will be the requirement to wear face coverings in public settings indoors, the legal duty on retailers to take “reasonable measures to reduce the risk of transmission”, along with the requirement for risk assessments to be carried out in certain settings.Contact tracing requirements – including the need for certain settings to record visitor information – will also remain in place after tomorrow.Guidance on testing, including the expectation that those working in certain sectors are tested regularly, will also remain in place after tomorrow.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLast year because we were in deep lockdown it never happened and because of the current Covid rules it had to be postponed again, which is probably why only three walkers came out to meet him at the Knap car terrace in perfect walking weather, on a bright and crisp morning to join in a -mile replacement walk.On the hillside just above them are the neat foundations of a Roman Building which contained  rooms all grouped around a courtyard with the building being dated to the late rd century AD by the Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust. It seems a natural harbour was to be found to the east of this area and one theory is that this was a guesthouse connected with naval activity at the harbour as no evidence of a water supply or baths common in villa’s could be found. In the early ’s the trust carried out excavations on site and pieces of Roman pottery and tiles were found and a public viewing  now overlooks the site.They soon warmed up due to a short but stf climb onto the clftop and followed a narrow path through woodland to descend the Golden Stairs into Porthkerry Country Park, where the frost covered board walk led them towards the ft Porthkerry Viaduct. Deviating off the cycle path at Robin’s Walk brought them into muddy fields beside the Whitelands Brook for the climb up to join the A opposite Welford and along the verge to cross a stile leading into fields behind Blackton Farm.A well-worn farm track led to the road for the journey to Penmark Village where they entered the churchyard of St Mary’s for their mid-morning refreshments, utilising the steps on the preaching cross as seating whilst enjoying the warm sunshine. The church dates to the th century being mentioned for the first time in  and a few centuries later the tower was added, but most of its medieval traits were lost when it was renovated during the Victorian era..removeThey continued and joined part of the long distance Valeways Millennium Heritage Trail, through fields on the boundary of Cardf Airport making towards Fonmon with its lovely duck pond and stunning weeping willow tree which cascades over the water. Then climbing steps into a small wood leading to muddy fields near Home Farm they eventually exited onto Port Road following it southwards to East Aberthaw.Taking time out they paused at the Blue Anchor for a swt pint outside in the fresh air before following Well Road downhill. This road was previously known as Marshe Way, one would presume because the River Thaw flowed to reach the sea by this route until the Aberthaw Power Station was built and the river was re-routed.Tramping muddy paths below the main Vale railway line through the nature reserve which is classed as a Site of Special Scientic Interest, they headed through the reed beds beside the western end of the delightful lake, overseen by the ruined Aberthaw Limeworks built in , to arrive at the sea defence wall. Heading out onto the beach they found a suitable place for lunch sitting on a washed up tree trunk beside the dunes and overlooking the Bristol Channel and English coastline before continuing along the salt flats.The beautul refurbished clf steps on part of the Wales Coast Path brought them steeply uphill into Fontygary Leisure Park, which was eerily quiet due to the winter months and reaching Fontygary beach, they continued up steps following the coast path past the old disused limestone quarries to reach the southernmost tip of mainland Wales and Rhoose Point. Onward through Porthkerry Holiday Park and the Iron Age hillfort at the Bulwarks, to slither downhill through the woods back into Porthkerry for the steep climb back up the Golden Stairs in order to make their way along the clftop to Cold Knap, just as the sun was sinking in the western sky.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

On Monday, January , the council’s cabinet signed off plans to consult the public on its plan to introduce the nursery places.Cllr Ben Gray, cabinet member for social care and health, said: “This school needs to be replaced — it’s clearly a building which is not fit for purpose. It’s really important that this moves forward and St Nicholas gets a primary school which is fit for purpose.”The new school would be built on the current site, just north of the main building. The main building would then be demolished, and the space used for car parking and spaces for parents and carers who drive to drop off their children, addressing existing congestion issues. The school would still be just a short walk away from the village’s church.According to a recent cabinet report, the current school buildings have “major defects”, with an estimated maintenance backlog of £,, adversely affecting teaching. The school has also faced issues with sinkholes and radon gas. Reception pupils have to walk to the nearby Old School building after morning assembly, along a road without pavement.Demand for local nursery places is growing, with new housing estates recently built in St Nicholas and Bonvilston, and permission for  more houses east of St Nicholas and  east of Bonvilston..removeBut the cabinet decided it would be too expensive to find an alternative site for building a replacement school twice the size of the current one, and instead chose to put forward the new plan for a school with  places and  nursery places. Refurbishing the current buildings was also seen as too tricky given the condition of the buildings and parking issues.Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education, said: “The school wanted to stay where it is. It is a Church in Wales school and they felt that their connection to the church was very important. The buildings would be very dficult to refurbish — they’re not up to scratch and it would be very dficult to retrofit them and to fit in a nursery.”The council’s planning committee has not yet granted permission for the replacement school building. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
