These included nine valued at more than £250,000.The most expensive was the construction of a new conservation workshop on the site of the disused mushroom shed in the Home Park area of Windsor Castle, at a cost of £2.2 million, funded by the Royal Collection Trust.A further £1.4 million was spent on a replacement roof to Apartment 1, Kensington Palace - former home to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, now occupied by the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester.Work is expected to start next year on essential maintenance to the East Wing, which will see around 10,000 Royal Collection items decanted elsewhere. The Sovereign Grant for 2018-19 will be £82.2 million - a core of £49.3 million, plus an additional £32.9 million for resurfacing the palace.

The most expensive form of royal travel, mile for mile, is the royal train which costs approximately £20,000 per journey. Charles took seven journeys on it, which has sumptuous sleeping and dining cars.He also billed taxpayers £15,385 to charter a plane for a private day trip to London from Birkhall, his estate in Scotland. Aides declined to explain the reason but admitted there was no official engagement, saying royals were ‘allowed to travel from residence to residence’.The public paid £18,170 for Prince William to join the Passchendaele centenary commemoration in Belgium last July – and a further £30,414 to hire a separate private plane for Prince Charles to go too. Aides said the two princes were travelling from different starting points in Britain and following different programmes in Belgium.          Prince William flies privately internally in a country, but takes commercial planes to fly abroad, costing a lot less than his father The rise in Charles’s travel bill is in part down to the fact that, as heir to the throne, he is undertaking more travel on behalf of the Queen, who has stepped down from foreign tours in view of her age.The Prince of Wales derives most of his money from the Duchy of Cornwall, an estate of mainly farmland and residential property that was set up to provide a private income for the heir to the throne and his family. His income from the Duchy rose by 4.9 per cent to £21.7million last year, while he also got £1.2million from the Sovereign Grant from the Government. The prince paid £4.8million in tax, which he does voluntarily, a rise of 2 per cent on the previous year.           Prince Andrew, Duke of York, Queen Elizabeth II, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Charlotte of Cambridge stand on the balcony of Buckingham Palace during Trooping The ColourYesterday officials said an incredible 10,000 precious artworks would have to be removed before the builders arrive in April.Some of the paintings, vases, tapestries and antiques will be loaned to galleries and museums around the country and the world.But others will be placed into commercial storage during the duration of the works.All 10,000 items are under the care of the Royal Collection, which has launched a massive operation to find them all temporary homes.          10,000 items are under the care of the Royal Collection, which has launched a massive operation to find them all temporary homesThe Chinese Dining Room, Yellow Drawing Room and lavish bedrooms used during state visits will all be pulled apart during the renovations - the biggest works at the palace since the aftermath of the Second World War.Leaky water pipes and dangerous old wiring behind the walls and beneath the floors all need fixing. Some 10 miles of pipes, 6,500 electrical sockets and 152 antique toilets will be replaced.The Duke of York’s private apartment will be affected by the works and he will have to move elsewhere in the palace. The Princess Royal, who also lives there, already has a second apartment at nearby St James’s Palace.Yesterday a senior courtier said it was hoped the works would not prevent the royals accessing the balcony for Trooping of the Colour next year, but admitted there was a doubt, saying: ‘It will be assessed. It needs to be safe.’ Another aide said: ‘We will be able to provide more details in the autumn, but the expectation is that it will be very much business as usual.’ He added the works were internal and there would not be any scaffolding on the outside of Buckingham Palace.

However, Canada Day is not the same as the day of Canadian independence.Although Canada as we know it first began to form through the 1867 act, it was still part of the British Empire, slowly splitting off throughout the early 20th century joining the League of Nations as an independent country in 1920.Total sovereignty was only achieved in 1982, when the UK Parliament moved the power to change Canada’s constitution to the Canadian government via the Canada Act.When is Canada Day?Canada Day marks the enactment of the Constitution Act, which was on July 1, 1867 and is thus held on that day every year.However, if July 1 falls on the Sunday, then Canada Day will instead be celebrated on July 2. That is why Canada Day 2018 will be observed on Monday, July 2. How does Canada celebrate Canada Day?According to Canada’s government site, Canada Day is an ‘opportunity to gather in our communities, from coast to coast, and to proudly celebrate all we have in common.       Canada Day celebrations are not limited to just people, with brands also getting in on the act. Skittles is partnering with the David Suzuki Foundation, a Canadian environmental group, to increase awareness about the country’s animal welfare.As part of the Canada Day celebrations the candy brand will be hosting live webcam stream of a man dressed in a beaver costume building a dam. It will give $10,000 to the foundation. The feed will start at 1.51pm EST, a nod to the 151st anniversary of the celebrations.In Ottawa, many musicians will be taking to the stage to entertain crowds on Parliament Hill and in Major’s Hill Park.Other fun events such as a live painting tournament, a miniature train ride and pop up shops will be happening around the Canadian capital.Ex-RuPaul\u0027s Drag Race star Gia Gunn on gender confirming surgery World Cup 2018 - Sweden vs Switzerland: All you need to knowGemma Collins\u0027s private jet claims debunked by fans on TwitterIndependence Day: All you need to knowEngland\u0027s next World Cup game: When is it, which TV channel is it on and where will it be played?Big Brother 20 Spoilers: Who gets nominated on Week 1?Are Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas engaged?

He’s Westminster’s very own Celia Johnson. Strike up Brief Encounter’s Rachmaninov tune.Mr Skinner continued to yack at Bercow, even when offered the chance of putting the point he had wished to make. He complained the moment had passed – he had been interested in contributing to the previous exchanges.It was all down to the fact that he was not one of the Speaker’s little gang of pretty ones.Any Conservative displaying such open dissent to the Speaker would be given the most almighty carpeting by Bercow.We would have had purple-gilled apoplexy. We would have had ‘I can deal with this, thangyew’ and ‘I do not need to be told how to conduct myself, let him be in no doubt about that’ and ‘if the Hon Gentleman is somehow under the apprehension that he can cheek the Chair, I must tell him that he is sorely ill-advised’ and so forth.He would have made a tremendous to-do about it.But Mr Skinner is not treated that way. Why? Because Bercow is scared of him. It is partly a classregional thing – middle-class Southerner Bercow is timid in the face of Mr Skinner’s more Northern and working-class ways – but it is also because Bercow, like any bully, is a coward who shies away from people who fight back.          John Bercow \u0027like any bully, is a coward who shies away from people who fight back\u0027And so he settled for dealing with Mr Skinner’s testiness by saying, ‘I hope his mood improves’ – and, a short while later, letting him put an indignant but rambling question to new trade minister George Hollingbery.Mr Hollingbery announced that he hadn’t got a clue what Mr Skinner’s question was about. End of scene.Mr Skinner may never have much liked Bercow. Stalwart socialists such as he find Bercow’s drift to the Centre-Left unpersuasive and opportunistic. But he has a point, hasn’t he? This Speaker does have very obvious favourites.A short while later, for instance, he called Dame Barry Sheerman (Lab, Huddersfield), an interminable figure who is as wet as a labrador’s nose but is forever being invited to give Parliament the benefit of his opinions. The moment ‘Sheerman’ was uttered by Bercow, Mr Skinner turned and said to an Ulsterman sitting behind him: ‘That’s one of his favourites!’Who else is in the Bercow club? Let us see. ‘Mister Kenneth Claaaaaaarke,’ as Bercow pronounces it, is a prominent member.

However the figures published by Which? are hotly disputed by LINK, which insists they are wrong and based on a faulty interpretation of the data.According to Which?, almost 1,500 of the machines – split equally between those owned and run by independent operators and banks themselves – were removed between November 22, 2017, and March 31, 2018.This equates to more than 300 a month, which is a six-fold increase from a steady rate of fewer than 50 closures a month since 2015.The closures appear to be a direct result of changes to the way LINK runs and funds the cash machine network, which come into effect on Sunday.The key change involves cutting the so-called interchange fee that the banks pay the operators of cash machines for every withdrawal made by a customer from 25p to 20p in annual steps over four years.

Average class sizes have risen for the third year in a row in secondary schools, and the percentage of classes with 31 or more students has also increased.\u0027Schools have had to make huge budget cuts over the past three years because government funding hasn\u0027t kept pace with rising costs. Many have had no choice other than to cut teaching posts which inevitably means larger classes.\u0027No school wants to do this because it means teachers are less able to give inidual support to pupils and larger classes drive up workload pressures. But the funding crisis has left them in an impossible position.\u0027A Local Government Association spokesman said: \u0027As we have previously warned, demand is reducing in primary schools but increasing in secondary schools.\u0027With nearly 70 per cent of secondary schools now academies or free schools, the lack of any council power or influence over the expansion and admissions policies of academies and free schools is a real concern.\u0027Councils must be given powers to force schools to expand if local agreement cannot be reached voluntarily where this is in the best interests of new and existing pupils.\u0027Most academies will be keen to work with their local authorities, but, in the minority of situations where this isn\u0027t the case, appropriate powers are vital to ensure all children get a suitable place.School standards minister Nick Gibb said: \u0027Although we have more children in our education system than ever before, the average primary class size is still 27.1 and the average secondary class size shows little change at 21.2.\u0027This is thanks to the 825,000 new school places we have created since 2010 the largest expansion of new school places since the 1970s.\u0027Alongside this we are spending £23 billion by 2021 to ensure every child regardless of their needs, background or circumstances has access to a good school place.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/28/15/4DB4DB3300000578-0-image-m-14_1530197303339.jpg","title":"Wayne Rooney finds pub Washington DC watch England play","story":"Wayne Rooney may have completed his big money move to Washington DC United yesterday, but clearly his thoughts were on England\u0027s crunch clash against Belgium.

Now I can’t wait to get on the pitch in a United shirt and join my new teammates to bring success to this club.’Jason Levien, DC’s chief executive who also co-owns Swansea City, said: ‘This is a seminal moment for our fans and organisation. Wayne is a global soccer icon and his presence at DC United will elevate our product on the pitch and soccer as a whole in our city and in this country.‘Wayne has thrived when competing at the most elite levels of soccer and we’re thrilled to have his leadership as we enter this new era at Audi Field.’          ‘It is fantastic to be joining DC United at such an exciting time in the club’s history with the new stadium opening in just a few weeks,’ Rooney saidDavid Beckham, who joined the LA Galaxy in 2007, said: ‘It’s great for Wayne.

Buckingham Palace said she was feeling ‘under the weather’, but aides stressed there was no cause for alarm.Courtiers said her cold was mild enough that no doctor had been called and she was not taken to hospital.And it seems the Queen will no doubt be back on form very quickly – as it is understood she was well enough to travel to Windsor yesterday afternoon for the weekend as planned.As well as this, the programme of events for next week – she is due to visit Scotland – is currently expected to go ahead.

This was a private visit, and did not count as an official engagement.After a day to catch her breath, the hard-working Queen met a host of guests at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday, including David Beckham and Sir Lenny Henry, for the Young Leaders Awards Ceremony.Looking suitably floral in a green dress, she appeared alongside Prince Harry and Meghan.On Wednesday, she hosted the High Commissioner for Tonga, the ambassador from Zimbabwe and other foreign dignitaries.

It is a film about men under fire, of course. But it is also a film about heroism, fear and sacrifice.Set during the Zulu War of 1879, it is a patriotic film, but not a jingoistic one. When the Zulus sing one last song to honour the courage of the British defenders, or when Lt Chard gazes wearily over the piles of African dead, there is rarely a dry eye in the house.          Even today, 54 years after its release, Zulu has lost none of its power. It is a film about men under fire, of course. But it is also a film about heroism, fear and sacrificeSo when the Silver Screen Cinema in Folkestone announced a special screening of Zulu to raise money for the Armed Forces charity SSAFA, they could hardly have made a better choice. Or so you might have thought.But some people see things differently. Almost unbelievably, this week it emerged that more than two dozen signed an open letter to the town’s mayor, urging him to cancel the screening.Their explanation is, in its way, a masterpiece of ignorance. ‘We believe,’ they write, ‘that the choice of the film Zulu, with its inaccurate portrayal of historical events and its distortions and racist overtones could have a negative effect on relationships within the changing and richly erse communities here in Folkestone.’ Where do you start with all this? Is Zulu markedly less accurate than other films (not least Hollywood’s recent versions of history, such as Saving Private Ryan, which ignored British and Russian involvement in World War II)?Not at all.Is it demonstrably racist? Again, obviously not. The film takes care to show the Zulus as noble adversaries.          Little House on the Prairie, pictured, is facing a boycott because of the author of the original books for \u0027anti-Native and anti-Black sentiments\u0027Indeed, the current Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi served as an adviser to the filmmakers and actually plays his own great-grandfather, King Cetshwayo.Could a charity screening of Zulu really have a ‘negative effect’ on race relations on the Kentish coast? Is it plausible that, having seen it, people will start throwing spears at each other, or barricade themselves in their homes and open fire on passing foreigners?Of course not.If this story were just a bizarre anomaly, it would be easy to laugh it off. Unfortunately, though, it is part of a trend.For there was another story about censorship this week, this time from America. Yielding to pressure from more self-proclaimed activists, the U.S. Association for Library Service to Children has removed Laura Ingalls Wilder’s name from its award for children’s literature.As many readers will know, Wilder was the author of the Little House On The Prairie series, published in the Thirties and Forties, which told the story of a pioneer family in the 19th-century American West.Turned into a hugely popular TV series in the Seventies and Eighties, the books are the embodiment of old-fashioned, innocent children’s entertainment, which makes them irresistible to little girls, even today.So why on earth take Wilder’s name off the award? You can probably guess. Wilder’s books, her critics claim, are full of ‘anti-Native and anti-Black sentiments’. The characters say things like: ‘The only good Indian is a dead Indian.’ Worse, they even call black people ‘darkies’.Today, we rightly regard such terms as utterly unacceptable, but the fact is that in the 19th century, when the stories are set, people really did say such things — and worse.Never mind that Wilder was a product of her time, as are we all. For when the activists shouted ‘Racist!’, not even the childlike innocence of her stories was enough to save her.I am not alone, I know, in feeling nothing but contempt for the disingenuousness, mean-spiritedness, sanctimony and intolerance of these people. I’m not alone, either, in feeling utterly infuriated by the cowardice of the authorities, who are incapable of realising that appeasement only encourages them to find a fresh target.  Films such as Saving Private Ryan ignored the British and Russian efforts of WWIIWhat I find really depressing, though, is that this is becoming such a familiar story. The activists make a fuss. The rest of us scoff, sigh or shrug them off as maniacs.But the authorities, terrified of being branded racist, give ground. And so, almost without anybody noticing, we take one more step towards a culture defined by the suffocating narrow-mindedness of the lunatic fringe. If that sounds too sensationalist, then consider this. Only a few months ago, a friend at Oxford told me that she no longer teaches Joseph Conrad’s novella The Nigger Of The ‘Narcissus’, because the title alone means she risks being branded a racist.Never mind that Conrad is a novelist of genius and that Narcissus is a book of note. And never mind that the whole point of reading fiction is to take us outside our bubbles, to challenge our preconceptions, to surprise and provoke us.Again, of course, it would be outrageous to use such terms about black people now, but surely students are capable of understanding the difference between moral values in the past and moral values today?The irony is the ultra-liberal censors, these new fascists of our age, preach about ersity. But they are obsessed by only one thing: race, or, more accurately, accusing others of being racist. They’re certainly not interested in ersity of thought, which might challenge their petty ideological prejudices.So Zulu is out. Little House On The Prairie is out, too. What next?An obvious target is anything written by a ‘dead white man’, to use the liberal fascists’ own jargon. William Shakespeare is out, obviously, because of the anti-Semitic figure of Shylock, the moneylender in The Merchant Of Venice, and the alleged racism of his portrayal of Othello (the ‘thick-lips’, as one character calls him). Who else? Dickens has to go, partly because of the anti-Semitic caricature of Fagin in Oliver Twist, but also because his women are all drippy, passive fantasy figures.Rudyard Kipling is definitely out, because his books show the British Empire in India in a good light.How long before the censors come for Agatha Christie, whose early books also stereo-typed Jewish people and who was also guilty of using the ‘N’ word in the title of one?And amid the current hysteria about sexual harassment, will any cinema ever be allowed to show an old 007 film?Where will it end? Well, it will never end. And because these censors have no sense of humility, they cannot conceive that people in the future will doubtless find us guilty of prejudices invisible to us today.By then, though, what will be left of Western culture? For if Zulu isn’t safe, if Laura Ingalls Wilder is not safe, if even the slightest hint of political incorrectness is enough to disqualify you, then nothing and nobody is safe.The truth is that these people are the enemies, not just of tradition or even of tolerance, but of the imagination itself.They talk endlessly about celebrating difference. But what they want to do is to suppress difference, control the imagination and rewrite history. And that, of course, is why they must be fought. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/29/01/4DBDC7EB00000578-0-image-a-9_1530232068220.jpg","title":"Seal numbers Thames doubles 5 years capitals river cleaner 60 years ago","story":"    A seal swims in the River Stour in Pegwell Bay, Kent, as marine biologists from ZSL (Zoological Society of London) undertake the fifth annual seal survey in the Thames Estuary in 2017Sixty-years-ago the Natural History Museum said the Thames was biologically dead and claimed pollution levels meant it was not suitable to be a thriving animal habitat.However, changes were made and their frightening prediction was avoided.Controls were put in place after the 1957 warning to control sewage discharge into the Thames. As a result, the population of grey seals has shot up 19 per cent from 2,406 in 2017, while the harbour seal population rose by 14 per cent in the same period.The zoological society has claimed the prevalence of seals shows the Thames has recovered since there is plenty of fish for them to feed on.

It is a film about men under fire, of course. But it is also a film about heroism, fear and sacrifice.Set during the Zulu War of 1879, it is a patriotic film, but not a jingoistic one. When the Zulus sing one last song to honour the courage of the British defenders, or when Lt Chard gazes wearily over the piles of African dead, there is rarely a dry eye in the house.          Even today, 54 years after its release, Zulu has lost none of its power. It is a film about men under fire, of course. But it is also a film about heroism, fear and sacrificeSo when the Silver Screen Cinema in Folkestone announced a special screening of Zulu to raise money for the Armed Forces charity SSAFA, they could hardly have made a better choice. Or so you might have thought.But some people see things differently. Almost unbelievably, this week it emerged that more than two dozen signed an open letter to the town’s mayor, urging him to cancel the screening.Their explanation is, in its way, a masterpiece of ignorance. ‘We believe,’ they write, ‘that the choice of the film Zulu, with its inaccurate portrayal of historical events and its distortions and racist overtones could have a negative effect on relationships within the changing and richly erse communities here in Folkestone.’ Where do you start with all this? Is Zulu markedly less accurate than other films (not least Hollywood’s recent versions of history, such as Saving Private Ryan, which ignored British and Russian involvement in World War II)?Not at all.Is it demonstrably racist? Again, obviously not. The film takes care to show the Zulus as noble adversaries.          Little House on the Prairie, pictured, is facing a boycott because of the author of the original books for \u0027anti-Native and anti-Black sentiments\u0027Indeed, the current Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi served as an adviser to the filmmakers and actually plays his own great-grandfather, King Cetshwayo.Could a charity screening of Zulu really have a ‘negative effect’ on race relations on the Kentish coast? Is it plausible that, having seen it, people will start throwing spears at each other, or barricade themselves in their homes and open fire on passing foreigners?Of course not.If this story were just a bizarre anomaly, it would be easy to laugh it off. Unfortunately, though, it is part of a trend.For there was another story about censorship this week, this time from America. Yielding to pressure from more self-proclaimed activists, the U.S. Association for Library Service to Children has removed Laura Ingalls Wilder’s name from its award for children’s literature.As many readers will know, Wilder was the author of the Little House On The Prairie series, published in the Thirties and Forties, which told the story of a pioneer family in the 19th-century American West.Turned into a hugely popular TV series in the Seventies and Eighties, the books are the embodiment of old-fashioned, innocent children’s entertainment, which makes them irresistible to little girls, even today.So why on earth take Wilder’s name off the award? You can probably guess. Wilder’s books, her critics claim, are full of ‘anti-Native and anti-Black sentiments’. The characters say things like: ‘The only good Indian is a dead Indian.’ Worse, they even call black people ‘darkies’.Today, we rightly regard such terms as utterly unacceptable, but the fact is that in the 19th century, when the stories are set, people really did say such things — and worse.Never mind that Wilder was a product of her time, as are we all. For when the activists shouted ‘Racist!’, not even the childlike innocence of her stories was enough to save her.I am not alone, I know, in feeling nothing but contempt for the disingenuousness, mean-spiritedness, sanctimony and intolerance of these people. I’m not alone, either, in feeling utterly infuriated by the cowardice of the authorities, who are incapable of realising that appeasement only encourages them to find a fresh target.  Films such as Saving Private Ryan ignored the British and Russian efforts of WWIIWhat I find really depressing, though, is that this is becoming such a familiar story. The activists make a fuss. The rest of us scoff, sigh or shrug them off as maniacs.But the authorities, terrified of being branded racist, give ground. And so, almost without anybody noticing, we take one more step towards a culture defined by the suffocating narrow-mindedness of the lunatic fringe. If that sounds too sensationalist, then consider this. Only a few months ago, a friend at Oxford told me that she no longer teaches Joseph Conrad’s novella The Nigger Of The ‘Narcissus’, because the title alone means she risks being branded a racist.Never mind that Conrad is a novelist of genius and that Narcissus is a book of note. And never mind that the whole point of reading fiction is to take us outside our bubbles, to challenge our preconceptions, to surprise and provoke us.Again, of course, it would be outrageous to use such terms about black people now, but surely students are capable of understanding the difference between moral values in the past and moral values today?The irony is the ultra-liberal censors, these new fascists of our age, preach about ersity. But they are obsessed by only one thing: race, or, more accurately, accusing others of being racist. They’re certainly not interested in ersity of thought, which might challenge their petty ideological prejudices.So Zulu is out. Little House On The Prairie is out, too. What next?An obvious target is anything written by a ‘dead white man’, to use the liberal fascists’ own jargon. William Shakespeare is out, obviously, because of the anti-Semitic figure of Shylock, the moneylender in The Merchant Of Venice, and the alleged racism of his portrayal of Othello (the ‘thick-lips’, as one character calls him). Who else? Dickens has to go, partly because of the anti-Semitic caricature of Fagin in Oliver Twist, but also because his women are all drippy, passive fantasy figures.Rudyard Kipling is definitely out, because his books show the British Empire in India in a good light.How long before the censors come for Agatha Christie, whose early books also stereo-typed Jewish people and who was also guilty of using the ‘N’ word in the title of one?And amid the current hysteria about sexual harassment, will any cinema ever be allowed to show an old 007 film?Where will it end? Well, it will never end. And because these censors have no sense of humility, they cannot conceive that people in the future will doubtless find us guilty of prejudices invisible to us today.By then, though, what will be left of Western culture? For if Zulu isn’t safe, if Laura Ingalls Wilder is not safe, if even the slightest hint of political incorrectness is enough to disqualify you, then nothing and nobody is safe.The truth is that these people are the enemies, not just of tradition or even of tolerance, but of the imagination itself.They talk endlessly about celebrating difference. But what they want to do is to suppress difference, control the imagination and rewrite history. And that, of course, is why they must be fought. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/29/01/4DBDC7EB00000578-0-image-a-9_1530232068220.jpg","title":"Seal numbers Thames doubles 5 years capitals river cleaner 60 years ago","story":"    A seal swims in the River Stour in Pegwell Bay, Kent, as marine biologists from ZSL (Zoological Society of London) undertake the fifth annual seal survey in the Thames Estuary in 2017Sixty-years-ago the Natural History Museum said the Thames was biologically dead and claimed pollution levels meant it was not suitable to be a thriving animal habitat.However, changes were made and their frightening prediction was avoided.Controls were put in place after the 1957 warning to control sewage discharge into the Thames. As a result, the population of grey seals has shot up 19 per cent from 2,406 in 2017, while the harbour seal population rose by 14 per cent in the same period.The zoological society has claimed the prevalence of seals shows the Thames has recovered since there is plenty of fish for them to feed on.

I took it on her wedding day in 1985. After the ceremony, which was held in a church in Manhattan, we went back to our aunt’s apartment on Park Avenue. When I was a child, my aunt would have us all over for Christmas dinner, so her home was very much a part of our family, although I hadn’t been there for a long time.The reception was an intimate affair, maybe 50 people, mostly family. It wasn’t loud. There was no music. My aunt was older. It was fairly staid, formal even, although Jill might remember things differently. My most salient memory of that day was that she married the most perfect person you could ever find. We were all very happy.This was a candid shot. There was no time to think about anything, barely time to focus. I don’t even remember if I asked Jill, who is wearing the gold dress, to stand up. And while that is an important Picasso on the wall – Angel Fernandez de Soto, from 1903 – I hadn’t intended to shoot it. Jill just happened to be sitting in front of it.I wasn’t really intending anything much. First of all, this was a party and I was a guest. And I didn’t have assistants. I was just walking around with my camera on a tripod, the flash on top, carrying some film holders between my legs or something. I do remember asking Andrea, the woman with the red hair, to turn. And I probably told my half-brother Paul: “Look at Jill.” But it all happened in seconds. The flash froze that stare on Jill’s face just as she got up.Look closely and you’ll see the similarities between her and the angel in the lamp directly behind her: the clasped hands the legs rendered visible by the flash the dress itself, a golden lamé masterpiece by Arnold Scaasi and the way Jill’s headdress melds with the floral arrangements behind to mimic the angel’s halo.There were further coincidences: the three apples in the painting on the right, echoing the three figures and that fortuitous slit going up the back of Andrea’s dress, breaking what would have otherwise been a very solid rectangle of white in the foreground. The whole palette! I mean, how about finding a redhead whose hair matches the walls?I know Jill’s face well, having photographed her so often. We are only 13 months apart, almost like twins, except that we’re so different. She is as uninhibited as I am controlled, and she has always had great style. I can’t remember if I showed her the pictures after her wedding. My family weren’t all that interested in my photography. I think they just thought: “Oh, here comes Tina again with her camera.” They were happy I was doing something, but I could have been a lawyer or a doctor or something. They certainly weren’t sitting there anxiously waiting to see the results. Actually, I don’t think I’ve ever had anybody anxious to see my pictures, probably because I rarely shoot anyone obviously self-conscious or vain. Which is not to say that shooting the wedding wasn’t scary. It was very scary – because I had such high expectations. I still do. Just recently, I photographed a woman who had appeared in several of my works from long ago. I hadn’t seen her in 30 years. The dreams and hopes I had for that image! You just never know if those dreams are going to come true.Training: Sun Valley Center for the Arts , Idaho.High point: “Having a solo show at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1990.”Low point: “Having rotator cuff surgery on my shoulder, which meant I was unable to photograph.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/715a20f4acc85afa67978ab5e9cf4998a87e2685/0_0_3126_3924/master/3126.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af2df09afacced9b4a9c9bf3e2eed68c 700w","title":"britain global military power armed forces defence spending","story":"This is project fear as surrealism. No armed force threatens the United Kingdom, or has done for more than half a century. The idea that British nuclear missiles\u0026nbspand “global reach” have kept our islands intact for that time is rubbish. So the generals battle with the Treasury about being a “tier-one power” and “global influence for good”, requiring “full-spectrum capability” and a “seat at the top table”. Sources tell me that when Theresa May, who mercifully still supports the Treasury, asked the defence secretary Gavin Williamson what “tier one” actually meant, he had no answer. The emperor’s clothes were made of cliches stitched with jargon.Last month the public accounts committee declared Williamson’s department out of control of its budget. It had recklessly overspent, on aircraft carriers, faulty destroyers and American F-35 jets. It is blowing £31bn on\u0026nbspfour new Trident submarines, with little support even\u0026nbspamong the generals.The thesis that money equals defence is false. Britain’s recent wars have all been aggressive, not defensive. In Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya, they have been against poor, ill-equipped enemies, none of them with ships, planes or heavy armour. Britain spends more than any European country on defence, but this has merely encouraged governments to engage in foreign intervention on the flimsiest of excuses. When troops hit the ground, they are defeated by men with beards and AK-47s, leaving behind only chaos and destruction. For £40bn a year, the MoD has delivered appalling value for money.Yet still it wants more. When Boris Johnson visited Afghanistan to escape his Heathrow fiasco this week, it\u0026nbspwas reputedly to pledge another 500 soldiers to Britain’s most costly and senseless war. What has this to\u0026nbspdo with “keeping Britain safe”?Galling though it might seem, May and Trump are at\u0026nbsplast asking the right questions. What are modern armies for, other than self-promotion? What should be\u0026nbspthe future of the Nato alliance? Might soft power, plain-speaking and even realignment prove a more helpful path to peace? The present tension with Russia is largely due to Nato recklessly pushing its border eastwards after 1989. To assume that the US’s nuclear umbrella would always cover this advance was unwise. Yet to pretend that a British deterrent is a substitute for an American one is absurd.If armed conflict erupts in Europe, it will be over messy borders and disputed strips of territory. Washington will not commit great armies to Europe merely because a Moscow tank has arrived in a Russian-speaking Baltic town, any more than it did in Ukraine. No serious person can anyway imagine Nato fighting a massed confrontation with Russia in central Europe, let alone at the behest of an Erdoğan of Turkey or Orbán of Hungary. The lesson of history is that Europe has to live with Russia, good or evil. If it goes to war, Russia wins.Arguments between states today are about cyber-attacks, trade wars and economic sanctions. If the US was to demand, as it reasonably might, that Europe set up its own joint firefighting force, as it failed to do in Kosovo, it would require just a few brigades per country. This week in Luxembourg, nine EU states set up a “military intervention force” for rapid deployment in the event of a crisis. I am told it is the 10th such attempt since 1954. Perhaps Trump might make it happen.Britain’s defence structure is Ruritanian, drenched in ceremonial, institutional history and abstract nouns. It still boasts “three services” and talks of “global force\u0026nbspprojection”. Lacking coherent threats, Britain’s generals have to dream up “unknown unknowns”. The\u0026nbsprest of Europe gets by without a global presence. Britain appears not to know how.A modern state needs domestic policing and homeland protection. It needs air and sea coastguards and a reserve for emergencies in cooperation with its neighbours, EU or no EU. The rest of Britain’s military edifice can be left to central casting. The current row over defence spending and the impending dust-up at Nato may leave much blood on the carpet. It will be well worth it if afterwards someone sits down quietly, ignores the ballyhoo, and asks how much money Britain\u0026nbspreally needs to protect itself. The answer might be refreshing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c2568f4ddb7f3c5cd7682aea2356f56ea733080/0_184_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3767fa71e5cb7c4e00af594fe6489014","title":"royal family finances day transparency press","story":"Its annual day of openness is a step towards much-needed transparency, but most of the royal press pack is elsewhereIt’s hailed as the one day in the year when members of the royal family come clean about their finances. At the end of June, the palace regularly opens up its books to public scrutiny when it publishes not just the report on how much the royal household has spent but also the financial results of the Duchy of Cornwall and the Crown Estate. In a year when the disclosure of the Queen’s and Prince Charles’s investments in offshore tax havens has been met with a deafening silence from their officials, a loosening of lips was long overdue.Thursday’s disclosures show that the Queen is doing very nicely from her taxpayer-funded sovereign grant, which rose to £76m last year and will go up to £82m in the current year. Some of this money is allocated for the refurbishment of Buckingham Palace, which will cost us all an eye-watering £369m over the next decade. Some of the costs could be clawed back if Buckingham Palace were opened up more to the paying public – as happens with the Swedish royal family’s palace in Stockholm, which welcomes visitors all year round. Yet the UK family has so far failed to do so.Prince Charles is in the money, too. His income from his private estate, the Duchy of Cornwall, is expected to rise in 2017-18 to a record £22m. He also gets another £1m or so from the public purse to pay for his travel costs.Transport has long been the royal family’s Achilles heel. A single visit last year by the Prince of Wales to India, Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore cost a staggering £362,000. It’s partly down to his air fare. The prince might need expensive, non-scheduled flights on RAF planes for security reasons, but costs could be kept down if he had a smaller entourage. For shorter trips, scheduled flights should be given greater consideration.We also learned that he has increased the amount of his Duchy money going to William and Harry from £3.5m to £4.9m a year. Most of this sum (which also includes some capital spending) is allocated for their public duties, but because we are given no breakdown it is unclear how much is used for personal spending. And now Harry has a new bride, we still do not know how much extra money will go on expenditure for Meghan.So far there has been no word from the prince’s spokespeople on whether, after the embarrassing revelations in the Paradise Papers about the Duchy of Cornwall’s offshore investments, there are any plans to change how his foreign holdings are overseen, or if they will be made more transparent.There are two other odd things in Thursday’s announcements that work against proper scrutiny. First the choice of date. The announcement coincided with Prince William’s Middle East tour, which meant that most of the royal press pack were abroad rather than at Buckingham Palace and Clarence House – and were thus unable to cast an expert eye over the accounts. Was this deliberate? There were certainly mutterings from some royal correspondents that the announcement should have been rescheduled, although the palace maintained that the date could not be changed because the reports had to be passed to parliament.Second, there is the question of bringing out three financial reports on a single day. Reporters and analysts received a mountain of data, which had to be quickly processed. To cynical eyes, this looks like the palace managing the message: they take a single hit on a single day, rather than having a succession of bad press days.To be fair, the palace is more forthcoming with its financial information than in the past, and this one day of openness is a step in the right direction. But wouldn’t it be healthier if this happened all year round?• David McClure is the author of Royal Legacy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aec4d788e0d5de993e7efd7bbb3fd18e7dd3b474/0_47_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e35bf2bdef70574d3d748ba6cf7a930e","title":"how do you play fortnite my week of trying to get addicted to the must play game","story":"Millions of children are hooked on it, so surely it can’t be that difficult to play the latest ubiquitous game For their birthdays, my godchildren ask for V-Bucks – a kind of internet currency used to buy clothes or weapons or a glider for their avatars on a game they are obsessed with called Fortnite.Their parents have held out. In order to get V-Bucks, you have to give the game your credit card or PayPal details. One parent I know is almost $1,000 in the hole because their child kept purchasing new outfits on the stored card. Easy to do.But my godchildren are dying for V-Bucks, it’s all they want. Currently their avatars have grey skin. Wouldn’t it be great to play the game with cool pink skin?I watch them play Fortnite and have to remember to breathe. It is stressful and moves quickly.“Just hide out on the edge of the island,” I urge, as their avatars in their shameful grey skin, with their blunt non-V-Bucks axe, enter a barn where they will surely get killed. They explain that a storm comes through the island and you have to move closer in, where the danger of being killed is high. As they are explaining this to me, they are killed.It is the most exciting 15 minutes you can have as a 10-year-old. It is fast and the stakes are high (you could and will die). You play with your friends – looking out for each other – with up to 100 people playing at once. Dying is, of course, terrible. But as dinner is called and we start another game, I realise it doesn’t matter. You just play all night, and maybe if you’re good enough, you eventually are the last person on the island.A few days later, my editor calls when I am in Tasmania for two weeks covering a festival. Did I know there was a new game that all the kids are playing that takes their attention away from their school work and makes them stay up all night killing each other, he asks?Yes, I do know that game! My editor asks if I would, perhaps, play Fortnite for a week to see how addictive it is? Of course, as long as I can put V-Bucks on expenses.But getting addicted to Fortnite is much more difficult than I anticipate. None of my friends want to play with me and short of hanging outside primary schools to find Fortnite friends, I have to hit up people I know. At this festival in Hobart people are always rushing off to see German post-punk industrial techno, and look confused when I ask them to play Fortnite with me. But one of the editors from Vice, a 20-year-old called Shaad, knows the game.“I’ll play Fortnite with you,” he says without much enthusiasm – before looking at my phone and telling me it is too old to download the game.“You need an Xbox or something.”It is two days into what was meant to be my week getting addicted to Fortnite. There is so much hype about this game being addictive and accessible. How can a game be addictive if it’s hard to get and no one will play with you?I put a call out on Twitter: “Anyone in Hobart got an Xbox I can borrow for a week to play Fortnite?”My colleague First Dog on the Moon replies. He has an Xbox and will bring it into Hobart (a two-hour round trip from his home) when he comes in on Saturday night to watch the wrestling at Night Mass.At 1:30am, I notice several missed calls and texts from Dog. He has the Xbox – where am I? I am across the road in an underground cinema dancing to techno and can’t hear my phone.Dog takes his Xbox back to the farm.Later that week, Dog drops the Xbox at my hotel but I have already squandered four days where I could have been getting addicted.Nonetheless, I can play it for 16 hours a day and fasttrack my addiction, I think. Then the  will have to pay for me to do gaming rehab in South Korea. But when I go to pick up Dog’s Xbox, it has gone missing somewhere between the front desk and my room.Frantic calls from the front desk are made to the home of the morning concierge: “Have you seen an Xbox? It was left here!”No one has seen it. Meanwhile, I am becoming stressed. The week is almost over and I haven’t even played Fortnite, let alone become addicted to it. How am I going to file my story? How am I going to find Dog’s Xbox?If I’ve lost it, will he ever draw again?How to break it to Dog?In my hotel room, I try to download Fortnite onto my Mac, even though internet forums advise against it, saying that playing it on a Mac is “laggy.” During the partial download, my computer crashes and the 65 tabs I have open all shut.I am still yet to play a game and my week of getting addicted to Fortnite is about to come to an end. I speak to my godchildren who are loving their V-Bucks sick. One of them has bought a “tomato head avatar” the other a “Deep Space Lander”. It’s alright for some, I think sourly. They have the friends and the equipment (and now the V-Bucks) to get addicted to Fortnite.The rest of us – with our old phones, our borrowed and missing Xboxes, our overloaded PCs – can only dream of being gripped in such a thrall."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9fd6406f832a2cf3300cf99ddc99f080a594ea2/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdbf3ac301a42b627fe385990c8d2c0a","title":"israelis call world intervene behalf palestinians","story":"We’re patriotic citizens but are horrified by the escalating tensions in our country: we fear for those who live hereThe state of Israel is facing a catastrophic situation, which could, alarmingly soon, lead to extensive bloodshed. It is time for the international community to act decisively. Substantive external pressure – political, economic and cultural – offers the only chance of emerging from this impossible situation before it is too late. Not a sweeping BDS-style boycott of the country, but erse, carefully crafted, acts of pressure.We represent a group of intellectuals and cultural figures central to Israeli society, several of whom are world renowned in their fields. We are patriotic Israeli citizens who love our country and who contribute tirelessly to Israeli science and culture, and to that of the world at large. We fully intend to stay here and continue to contribute, but we are horrified by the situation and fear deeply for our lives and those of our offspring, and for the lives of the 13 million Jews and Arabs who live here and who have no other homeland.The decision to direct our plea to the outside world is not taken lightly, and we do so with a heavy heart. The pressure we believe is needed must come from governments and parliaments, of course, but also from civil society, iniduals and establishments. Ever since 1967, not a single Israeli government has put a stop to the expansion of settlements in the occupied West Bank. Moreover, in recent years, the official and openly stated ideological policy of the elected Israeli government has it that this land, from the Mediterranean to the Jordan river, belongs in its entirety to the Jewish people, wherever they may be.In the spirit of this ideology, the processes involving oppression, expulsion and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians living in the West Bank are broadening and deepening. This includes Jerusalem, too, which was annexed by Israel in 1967, and the borderlines of which extend almost from Bethlehem in the south to Ramallah in the north. Israeli courts are in the process of legitimising the destruction of entire villages, and the Knesset is passing new laws that steadily decrease the ability of the courts to have a say at all. Others legitimise the additional expropriation of private Palestinian land in favour of the settlements built on them. These acts of one-sided expropriation violate those parts of international law that protect civilians of occupied territories, and some are even in violation of Israeli law.For years the international community has been talking about a solution based on separate Israeli and Palestinian states coexisting in peace and security. But current Israeli policy renders this impossible. During the 51 years of military rule on the West Bank, Israel has taken over large quantities of land, and has placed around 600,000 Israeli citizens there in hundreds of settlements. It supplies them with roads, water and electricity, has built and financed their health, education and cultural institutions, and has given them the same civil and political rights enjoyed by citizens residing within its sovereign territory.In contrast, Israel is squeezing the living space of Palestinian residents, who enjoy no civil or political rights. With the aid of laws, special regulations and military orders it shuts them out of the areas it has allotted to its citizens and for its military training activities. It delineates and then expropriates their private and public land on the basis of rules it sets down for the sole benefit of its own citizens. It confines their villages by surrounding them with fences and barriers, destroys houses and refuses to allow them to expand it imposes collective punishments, detains thousands of men, women and minors, tries them in a military court system and imprisons them in its sovereign territory.Since all these actions are being carried out in violation of international law, the resulting situation is no longer just an internal Israeli issue. The institutions of the international community have taken many decisions intended to curb these actions, but none has ever been accompanied by enforcement mechanisms.And so a destructive, violent and explosive reality is becoming the norm in these areas. We, who are located in the midst of this reality, believe the international community must help, since that community alone is responsible for enforcing compliance with its treaties and with the decisions of its institutions, and since in the current circumstances only it can do so.Never have these issues been as clear cut and as urgent as they are today: if peace is not established in this part of the world very soon, an area that has become a timebomb of national and religious tensions, there will be no future and no life for us or the Palestinians.• Ilana Hammerman is an Israeli writer and translator.

I stared at the caterpillar, unable to attach a name to it. I don’t think my mental powers are fading: I still possess an eerie capacity to recall facts and figures and memorise long screeds of text. This is a specific loss. As a child and young adult, I delighted in being able to identify almost any wild plant or animal. And now it has gone. This ability has shrivelled from disuse: I\u0026nbspcan no longer identify them because I can no longer find\u0026nbspthem.I have lived long enough to witness the vanishing of wild mammals, butterflies, mayflies, songbirds and fish that I once feared my grandchildren would not experience: it has all happened faster than even the pessimists predicted. Walking in the countryside or snorkelling in the sea is now as painful to me as an art lover would find visits to a gallery, if on every occasion another old master had been cut from its frame.The cause of this acceleration is no mystery. The United Nations reports that our use of natural resources has tripled in 40 years. The great expansion of mining, logging, meat production and industrial fishing is cleansing the planet of its wild places and natural wonders. What economists proclaim as progress, ecologists recognise as ruin.This is what has driven the quadrupling of oceanic dead zones since 1950 the “biological annihilation” represented by the astonishing collapse of vertebrate populations the rush to carve up the last intact forests the vanishing of coral reefs, glaciers and sea ice the shrinkage of lakes, the drainage of wetlands. The living world is dying of consumption.We have a fatal weakness: a failure to perceive incremental change. As natural systems shift from one state to another, we almost immediately forget what we have lost. I have to make a determined effort to remember what I saw in my youth. Could it really be true that every patch of nettles, at this time of year, was reamed with caterpillar holes? That flycatchers were so common I scarcely gave them a second glance? That the rivers, around the autumn equinox, were almost black with eels?Others seem oblivious. When I have criticised current practice, farmers have sent me images of verdant monocultures of perennial ryegrass, with the message: “Look at this and try telling me we don’t look after nature.” It’s green, but it’s about as ecologically rich as an airport runway.One reader, Michael Groves, records the shift he has seen in the field beside his house, where the grass that used to be cut for hay is now cut for silage. Watching the cutters being driven at great speed across the field, he realised that any remaining wildlife would be shredded. Soon afterwards, he saw a roe deer standing in the mown grass. She stayed throughout the day and the following night. When he went to investigate, he found her fawn, its legs amputated. “I felt sickened, angry and powerless … how long had it taken to die?” That “grass-fed meat” the magazines and restaurants fetishise? This is the reality.When our memories are wiped as clean as the land, we fail to demand its restoration. Our forgetting is a gift to industrial lobby groups and the governments that serve them. Over the past few months I have been told repeatedly that the environment secretary, Michael Gove, gets it. I have said so myself: he genuinely seems to understand what the problems are and what needs to be done. Unfortunately, he doesn’t do it.Gove cannot be blamed for all of the fiascos to which he has put his name. The 25-year plan for nature was, it seems, gutted by the prime minister’s office. The environmental watchdog he proposed was de-fanged by the Treasury (it has subsequently been lent some dentures by parliament). Other failures are all his own work. In response to lobbying from sheep farmers, Gove has allowed ravens, a highly intelligent and long-lived species just beginning to recover from centuries of persecution, to be killed once more in order to protect lambs. There are 23 million sheep in this country and 7,400 pairs of ravens. Why must all other species give way to the white plague?Responding to complaints that most of our national\u0026nbspparks are wildlife deserts, Gove set up a commission to review them. But governments choose their conclusions in advance, through the appointments\u0026nbspthey make. A more dismal, backward-looking and uninspiring panel would be hard to find: not\u0026nbspone of its\u0026nbspmembers, as far as I can tell, has expressed\u0026nbspa desire for significant change in our national parks, and most of\u0026nbspthem, if their past statements are anything to go by,\u0026nbspare determined to keep them in their sheep-wrecked and grouse-trashed state.Now the lobbyists demand a New Zealand settlement for farming after Brexit: deregulated, upscaled, hostile to both wildlife and the human eye. If they get their way no landscape, however treasured, will be safe from broiler sheds and mega dairy units, no river protected from runoff and pollution, no songbird saved from local extinction. The merger between Bayer and Monsanto brings together the manufacturer of the world’s most lethal pesticides with the manufacturer of the world’s most lethal herbicides. Already the concentrated power of these behemoths is a hazard to democracy together they threaten both political and ecological disaster. Labour’s environment team has scarcely a word to say about any of it. Similarly, the big conservation groups have gone missing in inaction.We forget even our own histories. We fail to recall, for example, that the 1945 Dower report envisaged wilder national parks than we now possess, and that the conservation white paper the government issued in 1947 called for the kind of large-scale protection that is considered edgy and innovative today. Remembering is a radical act.That caterpillar, by the way, was a six-spot burnet: the\u0026nbsplarva of a stunning iridescent black and pink moth\u0026nbspthat once populated my neighbourhood. I will not allow myself to forget again: I will work to recover the knowledge I have lost. For I now see that without the power of memory, we cannot hope to defend the world we love."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94307e2f19960310f688689cd1e5586459761291/0_1_650_390/master/650.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00f059bea7d05a01db6b689234507db8 700w","title":"scientists call for a paris style agreement to save life on earth","story":"Conservation scientists believe our current mass extinction crisis requires a far more ambitious agreement, in the style of the Paris Climate Accord. And they argue that the bill shouldn’t be handed just to nation states, but corporations too. Let’s be honest, the global community’s response to the rising evidence of mass extinction and ecological degradation has been largely to throw crumbs at it. Where we have acted it’s been in a mostly haphazard and modest way — a protected area here, a conservation program there, a few new laws, and a pinch of funding. The problem is such actions — while laudable and important — in no way match the scope and size of the problem where all markers indicate that life on Earth continues to slide into the dustbin. But a few scientists are beginning to call for more ambition — much more — and they want to see it enshrined in a new global agreement similar to the Paris Climate Accord. They also say that the bill shouldn’t just fall on nations, but the private sector too. In 2016, E.O. Wilson — arguably the world’s most lauded living evolutionary biologist — published a book called Half Earth where he proposed that to save life on Earth (and ourselves) we must set aside around half the planet in various types of reserves. Not surprisingly, the idea was immediately controversial — but it was also picked up by other scientists hungry for an ambitious, hopeful way of facing a future of ecological Armageddon. Last year, 49 scientists wrote a landmark paper exploring how feasible Half Earth might be across Earth’s different terrestrial ecosystems. But the head-line news of this paper was really this sentence: “We propose a Global Deal for Nature — a companion to the Paris Climate Deal — to promote increased habitat protection and restoration, national — and ecoregion — scale conservation strategies, and the empowerment of indigenous peoples to protect their sovereign lands.”In less technical parlance, this is a ringing call for a massive, global agreement that would look at drastically increasing the amount of the world covered by parks — in some cases up to the Half Earth goal — and indigenous protected areas. Indigenous people are now widely recognized as some of the best defenders of nature after decades of being sidelined. This new agreement, they authors contend, should embrace the Half Earth — or Nature Needs Half — goal.“A number of empirical studies are telling us that we need to set aside about half of the terrestrial and marine realms to avoid the worst of the two great environmental catastrophes — climate change and the sixth extinction crisis — looming on the horizon,“ Eric Dinerstein, the lead author on the paper, said. Previously with WWF, Dinerstein is today the Director WildTech and the Bioersity and Wildlife Solutions Program with the NGO, RESOLVE.Such an agreement would likely fall under the United Nation’s Convention on Biological Diversity, first established in 1992, as an international treaty. Today, the CBD meets every two years. In 2010, the nations of the CBD agreed to something called the Aichi Bioersity Targets, these are 20 goals that nations are supposed to be working towards by 2020. We’ve pretty much failed to meet the majority the targets, including halving habitat loss and deforestation, sustainably managing fisheries, preventing the extinction of known endangered species, and minimizing the impact of climate change on coral reefs.But we are close on one of the targets: setting aside 17 percent of land area under protected areas and ten percent of marine and coastal areas. Currently, 15 percent of land area is protected (though much of this lies in so called ‘paper parks’ which suffer from a dearth in funding) and about 8 percent of the oceans. The CBD has had a number of disadvantages. For one, much like the Paris Agreement, it’s non-binding and largely voluntary. This has been a necessary concession in order to get so many nations sign on — just like with Paris — but it also means there’s no legal way to enforce action. Just international peer pressure. For another it’s lacking a major signatory. Guess who? Yes, of course, the United States — that global black sheep. The non-binding treaty was signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993, but was never ratified by Congress. Every other nation in the world is a member of the agreement however.Finally, the CBD has not been able to garner the same kind of media attention and interest as the various climate change declarations. For some reason, an agreement about the fate of millions of species on Earth just hasn’t grabbed our attention-deficit media. But these drawbacks need not ensure that the CBD be toothless or ineffectual. And if there’s a time for it to prove its mettle, it’s now. Since the Aichi Targets expires in 2020, the CBD needs something to replace it. And it looks likely that the idea of Half Earth will be discussed. The Executive Secretary of the CBD, Dr. Cristiana Pașca Palmer, recently told the  in April that a new agreement should include a proposal to make half the planet more nature-friendly by 2050. This is not quite Half Earth — which envisions half the planet under various types of protection — it does, however, offer a significant ratcheting up of ambition compared to the Aichi Targets committed to ten years ago.The former Minister for Environment, Waters and Forests in Romania, Pașca Palmer says bioersity is the “infrastructure” that keeps our planet going. “In my view, we need to ensure that the entire planet is used sustainably,” she said in an interview. But this, according to Pașca Palmer, will require a wholesale change in our economy operates.“We need to...shift to an economic model that accounts for the fact that we operate within a closed system – planet Earth – and that our economic growth is limited by the ecological limits of the planet”Arguably, the largest element holding back greater conservation action worldwide is funding. To date, the money is simply magnitudes less of what is actually required. “As with any public good, bioersity conservation suffers from a free-riding problem, in which governments have an incentive to provide less than the optimal level of funding in the hope that others will cover the costs,” said Edward Barbier, an economist with Colorado State University, adding, “the current global bioersity crisis is in large part due to the lack of international commitment and funding over the past 25 years.”Barbier is a lead author on a new paper suggesting a novel way to ratchet up funds for the other eight million-plus species on the planet. “It will take around $100 billion a year to protect the earth’s broad range of animal and plant species, and current funding fluctuates around $4-10 billion annually,” he said, illustrating the massive shortfall for global conservation. In order to raise $100 billion a year — ten times more than is currently spent in the very least — Barbier argues we can’t just depend on governments but must turn to the private sector. He and his co-authors argue a any new agreement through the CBD should create a mechanism that would allow private corporations to join with their own targets and funding goals. But what would compel corporations to sign on?“Corporations depend on the health of our eco-systems and are therefore at risk of losing the very foundations upon which their businesses rely,” explained Thomas Dean, co-author of the paper and sustainable develop professor at Colorado State University. ”Growing awareness of this challenge will increasingly motivate corporations to engage.”The paper points to industries where bioersity is vital to their bottom line such as fisheries, forestry, agriculture and insurance. “For too long we have viewed corporate and environmental interests as adversarial. However they need to become aligned if we are to be successful both economically and environmentally,” Dean said. “After all, this is the fundamental purpose of an economic system — serving the needs of society in the short and long term.”But is protecting 50 percent of the world even possible? Let’s put it this way: it’s not impossible. Dinerstein’s study last year found that of the 846 ecoregions on land, over ten percent of them already have attained fifty percent protection. Moreover a number of countries — including Namibia, Bhutan and Venezuela — are close to fifty percent protection on land. Dinerstein says that conservationists will have to get creative to reach such an ambitious target, but he believes it can be done. “We will have to include semi-intact areas, managed areas, areas under indigenous protection, and probably about 7-10 percent restoration of key areas…The key here is to be strategic and protect the most irreplaceable sites first over the next decade and fill in the rest over the coming years.”This doesn’t mean every ecoregion can hit the 50 percent target. Some — think the tallgrass prairies of the US — have no chance. Indeed, the study found that 207 of the world’s ecoregions have less than four percent habitat left. Dinerstein says getting to 50 percent in these areas is “delusional” but aiming for 10-15 percent in such habitats via restoration would be a starting place. Such an endeavor would go a long way towards solving another global environmental crisis: climate change. Preserving and restoring forests and other habitats has long been touted as one of the quickest and cheapest ways of decreasing global carbon emissions. Around 15 percent of global CO2 emissions today are directly tied to forests being chopped down, peatlands drained or mangroves cleared. Of course, the biggest hurdle is likely to be political — as it was, and continues to be, with combating climate change. Will proponents be able to convince the world that Half Earth would be a positive — and inspiring — way to create a better, more ecologically stable world? “It is certainly a major challenge, as has been the case with the Paris Climate Accord. But we need to start somewhere,” Dean said. If all this sounds like utopian fiction, Dinerstein pointed to the fact that Chinese scientists have already published a paper on how they could hit 50 percent protected land in one of the most populous countries on Earth. “Nature Needs Half is the biggest idea out there,” Dinerstein said, “and the only one that could guarantee a future for all life on Earth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0036315b1242e2c7eb75152f08ec7acbb1d8eb8c/0_0_6000_8000/master/6000.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c2f528e573ea3167a39f04e542a93344 2020w","title":"vertigo is not the last word in misogyny but a feminist deconstruction of it","story":"‘Farfetched nonsense,” said the New Yorker. “The film’s first half is too slow and too long,” said Variety. When Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo was released in 1958, the critics were by no means all negative – “One of the most fascinating love stories ever filmed,” said The Hollywood Reporter – but, for the most part, the response was lukewarm. “A plot structure of egg-shell thinness,” wrote Penelope Houston in Sight \u0026amp Sound.Fifty-four years later, Vertigo took over from Citizen Kane at the top of a Sight \u0026amp Sound poll of the greatest films of all time and now, 60 years after its original release, the film’s status seems assured. The plot of Vertigo has more holes than a pair of fishnets, which can be off-putting on a first viewing. But, as with many great films, the story is little more than a skeleton on which to drape all the other, more interesting elements that you begin to see once you can look beyond the villain’s insanely convoluted modus operandi, the protagonist’s unfeasible gullibility and all the other “flaws” that make this the most magnificent, preposterous thriller of them all.Vertigo was adapted from the 1954 novel D’Entre les Morts (Among the Dead) by French crime-writing duo Boileau-Narcejac, whose credits also included the screenplay for Georges Franju’s classic horror movie Eyes Without a Face (1960), as well as the novel on which Henri-Georges Clouzot based Les Diaboliques (1955), the mother of all dark thrillers with shocking twists, which Hitchcock had, not surprisingly, admired. Set in Paris during the second world war, the book was influenced by another novel, Bruges-la-Morte, Georges Rodenbach’s 1892 masterpiece of Belgian symbolism, in which a grieving widower falls for a dancer who resembles his dead wife and (spoiler!) ends up strangling her with a lock of the dead woman’s hair.Hitchcock and his screenwriters (Alec Coppel and Samuel A Taylor) transposed the story of D’Entre les Morts to San Francisco and changed the ending, but otherwise preserved its main thrust. James Stewart plays Scottie, an ex-detective with acrophobia (fear of heights), who is hired by an old acquaintance to keep an eye on his wife, Madeleine (Kim Novak), whose odd, morbid behaviour has been giving him cause for concern. Scottie becomes obsessed with the woman he is stalking. After his phobia prevents him from saving her when she leaps to her death, he is inconsolable ... until he meets Judy, who bears a vague resemblance to Madeleine, and tries to recreate his lost love by dressing her in the same clothes.If, in some quarters, Hitchcock and his films are still considered the last word in misogynistic creepiness, Vertigo is exhibit No 1. “Look how strong and stable the male characters are,” says one critic (I’m paraphrasing, but not by much), while describing the female characters as simultaneously “unhinged, duplicitous and submissive puppets” – which would be quite a feat if it were true.While Scottie is Vertigo’s protagonist, his point of view is unambiguously delusional. There are only brief flashes from the female characters’ perspectives, but they are as clear-eyed as Scottie’s own vision is blinkered, and are as essential to the story’s poignancy as the women watch helplessly while he rejects the real world and spirals down into necrophilia. Judy loves him, but he is not interested in her – he just wants to remould her into the spitting image of his fantasy woman. She reluctantly capitulates, but was there ever a line as heartbreaking as: “If I do what you tell me, will you love me?”As for dear sweet Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes), Scottie’s friend and ex-fiancee – has there ever been a woman who watched Vertigo without identifying with her, even just a little bit? She’s clever, funny, down-to-earth and selflessly supportive, but what use are these attributes when the man she loves has no sense of humour or self-awareness, and prefers instead to lose himself in an ethereal, flaky fantasy of womanhood?It is not hard to find claims that Hitchcock’s female characters are blond and bad and deserve to die. “The sexual fantasies of his adult life were lavish and peculiar, and, from the evidence of his films, he enjoyed devising the rape and murder of women,” Peter Ackroyd wrote in Alfred Hitchcock: A Brief Life. “They all get punished in the end,” Bidisha wrote in a  article about Hitchcock’s women. “They were blond. They were icy and remote,” wrote Roger Ebert. “Sooner or later, every Hitchcock woman was humiliated.”And not for the first time, I wonder if I have been watching the same films as these other writers. Hitchcock himself didn’t help matters by colluding in his own mythology with statements that seemed designed to provoke. “I always believe in following the advice of the playwright Sardou. He said: ‘Torture the women!’ ... The trouble today is that we don’t torment women enough.”Of course, the film for which Hitchcock is best known – and which has inevitably coloured the popular view of him – is Psycho (1960), in which the blond heroine (Janet Leigh) commits a crime and pays the ultimate price at a disconcertingly early stage in the narrative. And one should not overlook his reprehensible treatment of Tippi Hedren, for whom he developed an unrequited erotic obsession while shooting The Birds (1963) and Marnie (1964), resulting in the sort of abuse that would rightly call down the wrath of today’s #MeToo movement.But just for a moment, let us consider Hitchcock’s women – all his women, not just the ones played by Novak, Leigh and Hedren. At all stages of his career, he surrounded himself with strong female collaborators such as his wife Alma (whose contributions to his work should never be underestimated), Joan Harrison (secretary, screenwriter and producer), Peggy Robertson (script supervisor and assistant) and Suzanne Gauthier (personal secretary).And for a so-called misogynist, his films feature a lot of intrepid heroines. Think of sharpshooting Jill Lawrence in The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934), feisty Erica Burgoyne in Young and Innocent (1937), Iris Henderson rejecting attempts to gaslight her in The Lady Vanishes (1938), Mary Yellen tackling a gang of wreckers in Jamaica Inn (1939), Charlie Newton realising there’s more to her beloved Uncle Charlie than meets the eye in Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Dr Constance Petersen treating her patient and solving the mystery in Spellbound (1945), Eve Gill sleuthing in disguise in Stage Fright (1950), Jo McKenna singing Que Sera, Sera as a child-locating device in Hitchcock’s own remake of The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956).Even when the women are nominally just love interests, they are unusually plucky and quick-witted. Take Pamela in The 39 Steps (1935), Carol Fisher in Foreign Correspondent (1940), Pat Martin in Saboteur (1942) and – above all – Lisa Fremont in Rear Window (1954), who proves she is more than just a vision of pulchritude in a perfect little day dress by breaking into the murderer’s apartment to snoop around. In all the rooms across the courtyard, Rear Window lays out the various stages of sexual relationships for the benefit of its commitment-phobic male voyeur, but marriage in Hitchcock’s films is rarely a happy-ever-after ending, more often the prelude to a woman’s struggle for survival in films such as Rebecca (1940), Suspicion (1941) and Notorious (1946).The monstrous mothers of Hitchcock’s films are often cited as another proof of his misogyny. Yet no one ever seems to question Hollywood’s perennial obsession with father issues. And why should mothers be self-effacing and weak? Besides, Mrs Bates in Psycho exists only as a figment of her son’s imagination, and Alexander Sebastian’s mother in Notorious is – from her point of view – entirely correct to be suspicious of his new wife, who is a spy. And offsetting the monstrous mothers or domineering housekeepers (Mrs Danvers in Rebecca, or Milly, hiding shrunken heads in Henrietta Flusky’s bed in Under Capricorn, 1949) there are always benign, dotty but delightfully unconventional – and both played by Jessie Royce Landis – Jessie Stevens in To Catch a Thief (1955) and Clara Thornhill in North by Northwest (1959). “You gentlemen aren’t really trying to kill my son, are you?”As for Vertigo, it mercilessly scrutinises romantic love while swooning over it. That giant redwood, Bernard Herrmann’s music, that dizzying dolly and zoom.

She refuses the familiar grace notes of comedy and sugary romance in favour of something more awkward and angular. Coixet has herself adapted this from the semi-autobiographical novel by Penelope Fitzgerald about an amiable young widow who comes to a remote coastal Suffolk town in the late 1950s, buys a dilapidated property there and enterprisingly converts it into a bookshop. She makes a success of it, largely by stocking Nabokov’s Lolita – thus incurring the envious displeasure of a local grande dame who had herself wanted the property for a self-aggrandising “arts centre”.Emily Mortimer plays Florence Green, the woman of quietly polite heroism at the story’s centre, Patricia Clarkson sports an expression of unfathomably queenly displeasure as her enemy, Mrs Gamart, and Bill Nighy plays the bibliophile recluse, Mr Brundish, who admires Florence’s courage and takes her side in this battle. He has an alarming habit of setting fire to the dustjackets of his books and so is predictably a very big fan of Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451. The prominence of that book gives something ominous to the movie’s narrative direction.It is a strange, subdued, rather miserable film, interestingly perceptive on conformism and philistinism as a way of life, and on the disconcerting wiles the inhabitants use in order to thwart Florence’s entirely reasonable plans. She is as baffled and dismayed as Kingsley Amis’s Jim Dixon is by the politics of university life. James Lance is unsettling and amusing as the oleaginous BBC producer Milo North who is a louche presence in the town, flirtatious towards Florence in an asexual and unappetising way.Perhaps only a non-British film-maker could have brought out the strangeness of this story it concludes by suggesting that everything has been about the glory involved in fighting for books and literary culture – and there is finally a rather pious invocation of John Berger. But this isn’t quite what the story has been about. It’s more to do with postwar Britain’s cold war of generation and class."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/055813e02e8b238e9293fcad66ff3e11051bb349/0_75_4208_2525/master/4208.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d27abfda0941e514c72f84d83316685c","title":"england belgium world cup group g match report","story":"Perhaps, trying to be optimistic, it might work out better this way, after all. Maybe England will have the chance later in this tournament to be grateful they avoided the possibility of a quarter-final against Brazil. And, without wishing to get too far ahead of ourselves, perhaps this defeat will not matter greatly if England can find themselves in a position whereby it is Sweden or Switzerland trying to prevent them reaching the semi-finals rather than, in theory, the five-times world champions.Alternatively it might just be that England come to regret the night Gareth Southgate chose to field a vastly changed lineup – a vastly weakened one, too, on this evidence – when the reward for preserving their place at the summit of Group G would have been a tie against Japan in the last 16.Instead England fell flat on a strangely subdued evening, full of intrigue but low on drama with the category-A players from both sides watching from the bench. It was a calculated gamble from Southgate and Adnan Januzaj’s winner, six minutes into the second half, means England will now have to take on Colombia next Tuesday, whereas Belgium get the plum tie against Japan the previous night.Japan, to put it into context, are 61st in Fifa’s world rankings, just above Honduras, Finland, Mali and Cape Verde, yet six places worse off than the Panama side England have already walloped for six. Colombia will represent a much sterner challenge and there are bound to be questions about Southgate’s thinking if the game in Moscow goes badly.Southgate plainly felt it was a risk worth taking, making eight changes and giving Harry Kane the night off. Even when England were behind, Southgate resisted any temptation to call for the player who is currently leading the Golden Boot scoring charts. Instead it was Danny Welbeck who was brought off the bench. Kane was there, in his kit, and so were Raheem Sterling, Jesse Lingard, Dele Alli and quite a few others. Marcus Rashford could not beat Thibaut Courtois with England’s outstanding chance and in the closing minutes it could hardly be described as an onslaught on the Belgian goal. And yet Southgate did not seem too crestfallen.As a spectacle this was a difficult one to assess. Roberto Martínez had put out a form of Belgium-lite, meaning the game went ahead with Thorgan Hazard, rather than his brother Eden, running at Phil Jones. Kevin De Bruyne’s absence further diminished Belgium’s powers. Romelu Lukaku was also given the night off, among nine changes, and it was a shame in many ways that the outstanding fixture of the group should be deprived of so many elite players. Hypothetical, perhaps, but it would have been much better fun if this fixture had been the first or second match, rather than with both teams already qualified.This was Southgate’s supporting cast apart from Jordan Pickford in goal and John Stones in the centre of defence and, though Ruben Loftus-Cheek also kept his place, it was difficult not to think that was to give the fit-again Alli more recovery time for the possibility of two games in the coming week.Nobody could say the two teams had been instructed to forgo their competitive instincts and, early on, Belgium’s players could be seen trying to convince the referee the ball might have crossed the goalline after a handling error from Pickford led to Gary Cahill’s recovery clearance.Equally there were other moments when whistles could be heard from the crowd, frustrated by the lack of penalty-box incident. This had been such an attractive fixture but, with both teams experimenting, something was lost. The tempo had changed. England had played with so much raw energy in their first two games. Belgium had, too – but not here.The tell-tale sign was when the first Mexican wave snaked round the stadium. On and on it went until it reached the end decorated in St George’s flags and, as always, died out immediately. Another one started and the same again. It made an interesting spectacle – the people throwing their arms in the air versus the saboteurs – but this was midway through the first half and did not say an awful lot for the match. An enthralled crowd does not usually need to make its own entertainment.England barely created a noteworthy chance in the opening 45 minutes. Rashford flickered only sporadically. Jamie Vardy found it difficult to make any kind of impression and the wing-backs, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Danny Rose, seemed reluctant to venture too far forward.Rose, in particular, had a poor evening because he will have to accept a sizeable degree of culpability for Belgium’s goal. Januzaj deserves a lot of credit for a splendid strike once he had twisted past Rose with a little feint, a drag-back and a change of body direction. From an England perspective, however, Rose was beaten too easily and it was a flat-footed attempt to stop the danger. Januzaj was coming in from the right and let fly with a diagonal, rising shot that flew over Pickford despite the goalkeeper getting his fingers to the ball.Finally there was a sense of urgency from England’s players. It was only briefly, though, and the game petered out without a great deal happening. Belgium’s understudies had outdone their English counterparts and Southgate will be glad to have Kane et al back for their next assignment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9d2e47e070382ee72bc9a7a6129fbd7eecefb47/0_156_2832_1699/master/2832.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20ca69da27f50c1f747f116c50cdcc25","title":"japan poland senegal world cup","story":"Akira Nishino, the Japan coach, admitted his tactics in the final 10 minutes of their game against Poland were “very regrettable” and left him feeling unhappy, after he told his players to “stay put” and keep the ball without trying to attack, despite the fact that they were losing. Nishino decided to “rely on the other match” in Samara, where Colombia were leading 1-0 against Senegal – a scoreline that would put Japan through via the fair-play rule provided they did not concede again or pick up any further yellow cards.That controversial approach ultimately worked as Japan, who finished with an identical record to Senegal in terms of points, goal difference and goals scored, progressed to the last 16 because they picked up two fewer cautions. Nishino, however, sounded uncomfortable with a decision that went down badly with the majority of the spectators inside the stadium as the end of the match was played out to whistling and boos.“I’m not too happy about this but I forced my players to do what I said. We did not go for victory, but we just relied on the other match. I view that it was slightly regrettable but I suppose at that point that I didn’t have any other plans. The World Cup is such that these things happen. And we went through. Therefore it was perhaps the right decision.”Aliou Cissé, the Senegal coach, refused to complain about the rule that saw his team eliminated. “This is the law of the game,” Cissé said. “We have not qualified because we did not deserve it. This is life. We have a number of rules which have been established and we have to respect that. We are fully committed and maybe because we are so committed, we get more yellow cards.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26edb92bd12f41c034a3428f955caa2bb0cd1fe1/249_651_5059_3036/master/5059.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46cf3f2fb20e8c74e452058a11116d01","title":"toni kroos germany world cup exit","story":"• ‘We were not unlucky. It is not down to bad luck’• ‘It’s a very black moment for German football’From Toni Kroos there was no attempt to downplay the significance of Germany’s exit from the World Cup, nor any attempt to deflect the blame. Admirably straight-talking when things were going well, he was also admirably straight-talking now they have gone badly.“In the end we did not do enough,” the midfielder said. “To be honest, if we can’t score a goal in 90 minutes against South Korea then we don’t deserve to go through. We got what we deserved. We were not unlucky. It is not down to bad luck.”Kroos had seemed to embody German resilience in their second group game against Sweden, making the mistake that led to Ola Toivonen’s goal but then whipping home the brilliant injury-time equaliser. Neither he nor any of his teammates could find similar inspiration in a strangely flat performance against South Korea.“I think we tried our best, it wasn’t a lack of that,” Kroos said. “We tried everything to play football but we just couldn’t get going. It makes life much easier if you score an early goal but in all three games we have been chasing it, we have been behind on the scoreline. That always makes it more difficult. We are very sad and we were also very angry but that helps nothing now.”This is the first time Germany have failed to make it beyond the first round of the World Cup since 1938 and Joachim Löw, who has been in charge for 12 years, has refused to confirm he will stay on for the two years that remain on his contract.“I don’t know if is the darkest moment for German football but it is definitely a very black one,” Kroos said. “I don’t think any of us expected this at all.

Although there are ways round it … It’s the morning after the night before, and as you gradually wake up, a jarring and worrying thought occurs to you. There’s no football. You draw a deep breath. There’s. No. Football. After 48 games in 15 days, the World Cup group stage is over. How the hell are you going to fill your day now?We are told that checking a phone first thing in the morning isn’t good for bleary eyes, but can technology really be bad if it’s being used to check the status of Marouane Fellaini’s contract? Or to see if Jack Grealish has expressed a desire to play Premier League football? There may even be breaking news on Nabil Fekir’s knee ligaments. It’s easy to forget that without the World Cup, a protracted saga about Antoine Griezmann’s release clause would be forced to provide the excitement of the entire group stage. For the truly fanatic football fan, there are always more matches to be sought out. Friday isn’t entirely free of fixtures. Gibraltar’s finest, Lincoln Red Imps, face every hipster’s favourite Kosovan club, FC Drita, in the final of the preliminary round of the Champions League, for the right to enter the first round of qualifiers. The stakes may seem a world apart from the epic World Cup events in Russia, but a two-legged tie with former finalists Malmö awaits the game’s winner.While thinking about travel, perhaps your club’s pre-season friendlies are something to plan for? Although Leeds’ progressive trip to Myanmar has sadly been and gone, you could follow Manchester City or Liverpool to New York in late July, and ask the locals how they fared in the World Cup. For readers in the UK, how about arranging lifts to see Curzon Ashton prepare for the visit of European heavyweights Burnley, or work out how you get to watch the Severn Derby, Cardiff v Bodmin Town. On the other hand, maybe thinking about the expenditure reminds you that splashed the cash on a replica shirt and a massive round of drinks for everybody in the wake of England’s 6-1 thrashing of Panama. Perhaps globe-trotting plans are of little use. Some consolation, though, would be spending the morning simulating the remainder of the tournament on Fifa 18, a soothing balm for a football-addled brain.Alternatively, if you want to pretend you’re a genuine England footballer, you could fill the tournament’s dead spaces with copious games of Fortnite, sitting resplendent with Beats around your neck, Jesse Lingard’s celebrations at hand.Or why not scroll mindlessly through football Instagram, checking out what the World Cup squads are doing on their day off, keeping an eye Iceland’s pin-up right winger Rurik Gislason, or Héctor Bellerín, who has this summer traded in the Spanish World Cup Squad for a life of high fashion. In Britain there’s always the pleasant discovery that BBC iPlayer have kept entire matches available this year. Missed the first half of Peru v Denmark? Never fear. And nostalgia could always offer its sweet seduction - an afternoon could easily disappear down a YouTube wormhole, watching Carlos Alberto in 1970, Tardelli in ’82. Then back to 1990. Pavarotti accompanies a World Cup montage. Quiet tears in a darkened room.Maybe some fresh air is needed. There is even the possibility of playing a game of actual football, but the that niggly bad back, and the worry of being nutmegged by an eight-year-old soon puts paid to that idea. Instead, why not sit in the park, cross-legged on the ground, with your Panini album open, eagerly ripping open the 30 packets of stickers you’ve just spent £24 on while sad-eyed children were buying just one packet with the precious 80p they’ve saved from their pocket money.

But campaigners have said a planned cut in fees paid by banks for each withdrawal, beginning on 1 July, is already making it more difficult for independent operators to survive, particularly in thinly-populated areas. The cut may appear small, but independent operators, which run many of the machines in convenience stores in remote locations, have said it is likely to make many ATMs unprofitable. Which? said the pace of closures has accelerated rapidly since 2015, and that cutbacks are deepest in rural areas, despite promises by the Link network to maintain access. The consumer rights organisation and the Federation of Small Businesses have launched a Save Our Cashpoints campaign, calling for a review to fully evaluate the impact the cuts will have on communities and consumers’ ability to use cash payments.Earlier this month the banking industry body UK Finance said that debit card payments had overtaken cash as the most popular form of payment in the UK for the first time.It said it was aiming to protect rural communities by reducing the “interchange” fee in busy centres but increasing it in more remote areas. “This is all about the banks wanting to cut the fees they have to pay rather than anything else. Link has been forced into these cuts by the banks who are threatening to move to Visa and Mastercard schemes where the fees are even lower, but which would result in much deeper cuts to the free ATM network.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14285d5417f43df3834e275621d7084f2b93cbc6/931_1549_8330_4997/master/8330.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9dbcc29b24cdaefad1d8009bbe7135d2","title":"florence and the machine high as hope review","story":"Florence Welch’s fourth album is most powerful when focused on the small, telling details of encroaching adulthoodFlorence Welch recently told a journalist that her fourth album pursues a noticeably different direction. It is, she confirmed, less “Florence-y”. It’s a statement that is hard to read without raising a quizzical eyebrow. Being Florence-y means dealing in a showy kind of musical melodrama, where tribal drums meet sawing orchestras, grandiloquent piano and the singer’s war-cry voice, heavy on the vibrato. It’s an approach that has earned her three platinum albums and a level of fame that’s led Penguin to collect and publish her biro-written poems, lyrics and inspirational notes-to-self in a book.Moreover, we have been here before. Her last album, How Big How Blue How Beautiful, arrived in 2015 after advanced publicity suggested it was going to be less Florence-y, too: the stripped-down work, as she put it then, of “a quiet person”. In reality, it sounded like the work of a person who could drown out a car alarm at 20 paces an album during which you couldn’t swing the proverbial cat without clobbering a 36-piece orchestra, a lyrical metaphor involving Greek mythology or a massed choir of multi-tracked Florences turned up to 11.But the first single from High As Hope suggested that, this time, she might mean it. Sky Full of Song dials things down considerably compared with the florid arrangements and bug-eyed vocals of What Kind of Man?, the song that introduced How Big How Blue How Beautiful. The orchestra are present but hovering in the distance behind a muted double-bass. The Choir of the Massed Florences are in a subdued mood, the vocals so close-miked that you can hear her breathing between lines. There is a sense of someone who realised that heading any further down the path of her previous albums might have led her into the realms of self-parody.On occasion, the urge to go full-steam am-dram proves too hard to resist. The song 100 Years spends five exhausting minutes pelting the listener with every trick in the Florence book. Hunger takes a similarly Sturm und Drang approach, although its melodic foundations – and, indeed, her stark depiction of a teenage eating disorder – are strong enough to support the storeys of embellishment stuck on top. Elsewhere, she is capable of more restraint than ever before. Frequently, Welch’s notion of reining herself in simply involves waiting until the closing moments of a track before letting fly with the operatic vocal leaps and the thunderous drums. Nevertheless, these songs are allowed significantly more room to breathe than those on her previous albums.The relative lack of clutter reveals something intriguing. Clearly desperate to be the kind of artist who constructs a phantasmagorical world in which listeners might lose themselves, Welch turns out to be really adept at something more earthbound. The music is most appealing when it is pared back – as on the sparse opener June – and her voice is most powerful when she isn’t belting it out. Similarly, High As Hope’s most emotionally impactful lyrics come when she abandons the rococo metaphors and focuses on small, telling details. She is very sharp on that point in your early 30s when the realisation dawns that you can’t keep deluding yourself you’re not really an adult yet. There’s a lovely section in Hunger in which the music builds as she feels the mounting excitement of Friday approaching, only to realise that the messy hedonism of the weekend is something she is better off observing fondly from a distance: “Oh you and all your vibrant youth,” she sings, looking on, “how could anything bad ever happen to you?” South London Forever mixes up fuzzy memories of youthful indiscretions – staggering from a pub, “holding hands with someone I just met” while on ecstasy – with a warning that you should enjoy that stuff while you can, before indulging in it makes you a crushing embarrassment: “It doesn’t get any better.”The latter song is poignant and airily beautiful: it doesn’t need a tacked-on grand finale. That it has one highlights the problem at the heart of High As Hope, an album that is undoubtedly a progression from her previous work, filled with well-written songs but still frustrating to listen to. It gives the distinct impression that there is a different artist somewhere within Florence Welch, struggling against the desire for grandiosity and the kind of big musical statements that have powered her career. High as Hope suggests she should sweat the small stuff more often.• Comments on this review will be pre-moderated.Georgia Anne Muldrow – OverloadThe first fruit of the soul auteur’s hook-up with Flying Lotus’ Brainfeeder label: beautifully poised between classic 90s R\u0026ampB and something strange, disorientating and psychedelic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06ab7eb4e281a6848566975d10dd3f7e7cb7d77e/0_0_3969_2497/master/3969.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2401e7e005f6cbb9846901c2e8fd8d98 700w","title":"napping may scores own goal in face of belgium brexit striker","story":"It was a slow-motion apocalypse as the prime minister dribbled incoherently at EU summitNot even catching a glimpse of Iain Duncan Smith in the Daily Mail cleverly comparing British business to Nazi collaborators – irony meters went off the scale – could spoil Theresa May’s morning. Flying to Brussels was the prime minister’s very own “me time”. A time when she could put her feet up and no one or nothing could get to her for an hour or so. Several members of her cabinet could have launched blue-on-blue attacks. One of two might even have resigned. And she would be none the wiser. Which is just the way she liked it.Life was about to get better still. Her two-day visit to the European council was about to merge into a four-day weekend because she literally had nothing to do. The summit was meant to be the time when the prime minister spelled out the final details of Britain’s withdrawal agreement with the EU but what with one thing and another – mainly her incompetence and cluelessness – this had been pushed back yet again.She was now hoping she would be in a position to announce the terms of the withdrawal six months after Britain had withdrawn. So she could sit back, kick off her shoes and let the other EU leaders rabbit on. They might all get round to discussing Brexit once she had left, but it worked better for everyone that way. It was the only way any progress could be guaranteed.Shortly after landing, May stopped off for a coffee. It was customary to let the more important EU leaders turn up first, so she had time to kill and could watch them arrive on TV. There were Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel embracing one another. May felt a small pang of sadness. There was a time when she might have been a member of the inner circle. There again, she wasn’t even a member of the inner circle in her cabinet any more.A little later, the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, appeared and gave a mini press conference. After talking about immigration, he was asked for his thoughts on how Brexit was progressing. “I don’t want to say it’s apocalyptic but…” he said. But it was apocalyptic. Next came the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar. “We had been expecting progress … any progress,” he said unhelpfully. Was Britain really being serious in its negotiations. “We’ll have to wait and see.” If there had been anything left alive in Theresa, it too would have died at that point.Then the prime minister got the nod. There was a spare five minutes on the red carpet if she wanted to use it. May wandered purposefully towards the only microphone that wasn’t switched on so her opening words went unrecorded. Eventually the sound cut in and she could be heard saying how happy she was that the summit was prioritising the prohibition of chemical weapons. Everyone looked blank. They had imagined immigration was the main subject up for discussion.Next came the Brexit question. “We are making very good progress,” said May. The blank faces turned even blanker. What did she imagine little progress would look like? A reporter pointed out that wasn’t what the other EU leaders were saying. “We’ve been setting things out,” she babbled desperately. “We’re in a strong position … we want to sit down and move at pace.” A snail’s pace.Once inside the main hall, the Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, made a beeline for the prime minister. Pulling a Belgian football shirt out of his bag, he thrust it into May’s hands. Which she promptly held up for the cameras. Half time: Belgium 1 (May og), England 0.“Oh look,” she said. “It’s got a Number 10 on it. I live at Number 10. What a coincidence! Are Belgium playing tonight?”Michel couldn’t believe his luck and started distributing Belgium scarves to everyone else. Jean-Claude Juncker held his above his head. So, too, did Varadkar. Before long the whole room was pointing at the prime minister and chanting, “You’re shit and you know you are you’re shit, and you know you are.” Final score: Belgium 27, England 0."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae67ae011884acf5a761bd59f3e656d9e7e4198a/331_42_3664_2198/master/3664.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8952ce63fc8812e9fd86cedcceb6c1ba","title":"theresa may faces new conflict with defence secretary","story":"Gavin Williamson wants to rush through publication of defence reviewTheresa May will face pressure from the defence secretary to publish an interim report on the government’s defence review before the Nato summit later this month to demonstrate to international allies her commitment to the armed forces.Gavin Williamson is expected to attend talks with the prime minister and the chancellor at Downing Street next week where the  understands he will make one final push for her to sign off his modernising defence review.Whitehall sources said Williamson felt the Nato summit in Brussels later this month presented the government with a unique opportunity to boost Britain’s global influence by showcasing its plans to leaders including the US president, Donald Trump.The defence secretary faces an uphill battle as No 10 sources indicated May was unlikely to agree to interim publication as she had already told Williamson that his first draft of the plan was not fit for the future and needed more work.One source said: “It was half-baked. Publishing even a bit of it just now to show our strength at Nato would be problematic.”The review is aimed at shaking up British defence and security capability to match 21st-century threats. May believes it must protect the UK against cyber-attacks and other new threats, with a reduced focus on more traditional military hardware. However, the prime minister has twice shied away from pledging that the UK should remain a “tier one” military power on par with the US, Russia, China and France, even though the phrase is understood to feature in the review. She was said to have asked Williamson to explain what that would mean for UK in practice.Ministry of Defence officials are concerned that the focus on new threats should not come at the expense of the UK being ready to respond to “conventional” ones. “It’s not about eitheror, it’s about having a complementary set of capabilities,” said one.There has been an increasingly acrimonious relationship between Williamson and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, over a push for an extra £2bn a year in defence spending on top of the existing £35.3bn budget. The defence secretary’s intense politicking is understood to have irritated both No11 and No10.Whitehall sources played down reports that next week’s meeting would be used by Williamson to push for more money for defence, adding that finances were only expected to come up in the context of the MoD becoming more efficient. One said: “The MoD got £800m extra at the end of March and that’s given relief for this year. We wanted to do something in and around the Nato summit so we can unveil headline conclusions from the defence review and make a statement of intent on our capability, as opposed to showing how much we are spending.” Ministers are concerned about Trump’s plan to meet Vladimir Putin on 16 July in Helsinki, straight after the Nato summit and his visit to the UK. It will put May under pressure to use the visit to convince him not to do any sort of deal with Russia that may harm Nato or heighten tension on Europe’s eastern borders.

The investment firm part owned by Jacob Rees-Mogg set up a fund in Ireland in March and warned investors of the “considerable uncertainty” posed by Brexit.Ashcroft extols the country’s sunny Mediterranean climate in the piece that also features quotes from Malta’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, and praises its “wonderful quality of life” describing it as a country where “violent crime is rare”.The article only mentions the killing of Caruana Galizia, an investigative journalist who exposed corruption among the country’s ruling elites, in a paragraph towards the end.“Malta has also suffered reputational damage in the past year from allegations of political corruptionmoney laundering and the tragic murder of the woman journalist at the centre of many of the claims,” Ashcroft writes. “Daphne Caruana Galizia, aged 53 and a mother of three, was killed by a car bomb on October 16 2017: her three alleged killers have been charged in connection with her death, while the ‘Mr Big’ who apparently ordered the murder remains at large.”The family of the murdered journalist believe that three men awaiting trial for the crime were acting on orders from inside Malta, while they and politicians from outside the country have called for the investigation to be widened to pursue those “with a motivation for silencing” her.Ashcroft, 71, is a former Conservative party treasurer and deputy chairman who has given millions to the party. The pro-Brexit peer has substantial business interests in the small Caribbean nation of Belize and writes political books, including a controversial biography of David Cameron that featured a lurid allegation involving a dead pig’s head.

But new research suggests that the chances of dying may level off – at least for those who make it to 105 years old.The study found that death rates, which rise exponentially in adulthood, begin to decelerate after 80 years old and appear to eventually plateau, or even decline slightly, after the age of 105. By that point, the chances of passing away in a given year are approximately 50-50.“It’s the equivalent of tossing a coin each year,” said Prof Jim Vaupel, a specialist in ageing at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Germany and one of the authors.The findings add fuel to an unusually hostile debate between two camps of scientists, who are locked in an escalating dispute about whether humans are approaching their upper limit in terms of life. The latest paper, from Vaupel’s team who argue there is no evidence of a looming longevity limit, is based on data tracking the survival trajectories of almost 4,000 Italians older than 105 between 2009 and 2015. And they believe it bolsters their position. The latest study is not the first to tackle the question of what trajectory the human mortality curve takes for those who survive into extreme old age. However, previous efforts were hindered by small sample sizes and a failure to meticulously check birth records. “Age exaggeration is common among the oldest old”, according to the analysis in the journal Science. One explanation for the result is purely statistical: those who die in a certain age group in a given year tend to be the frailest. The following year, the survivors are one year older, but they are also relatively stronger and healthier. “Eventually the two factors, the ageing and the weeding out, counterbalance each other,” said Vaupel.Biological factors may also play a role. Cancer, for instance, becomes less common in the oldest people alive, which some have put down to a slow-down in cell ision in this age range. “Cancer is quite a common cause of death for people in their 70s, 80s or 90s,” said Vaupel. “But very few people die from cancer over 100.”Similar mortality plateaus are observed in a range of other species, including fruit flies and nematode worms, which the scientists said could hint at a common evolutionary explanation. Other animals, including certain fish and tree species, follow the reverse pattern, with the chances of death lessening for each year alive as they continue to grow in size.The oldest human to have lived, according to official records, was Jeanne Calment, a French woman who died at the age of 122 years in 1997. Some claim the fact that this record has not been broken, despite an expanding pool of centenarians, is evidence that humans cannot live much beyond this age. And the latest findings appear to have escalated the ongoing debate.“It seems rather far-fetched that after increasing exponentially, the chance of dying should suddenly stop in its tracks,” said Jan Vijg, a geneticist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. Vijg previously published a paper in Science’s competitor journal, Nature, suggesting that the human species has hit its maximum shelf-life that prompted five separate teams to submit critiques of the work. “I do not consider the evidence for a plateau presented in this paper to be especially strong,” Vijg added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fa3bf3abdbdce1fd9789a29e126bca7813e0d79/96_18_2313_1388/master/2313.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d62d33d2e73106466466c2c4ae66847","title":"spacewatch ryugu an asteroid under close inspection","story":"Japan’s Hayabusa2 spacecraft plans to strike the asteroid creating a crater and dislodging rocks for analysisJapan’s Hayabusa2 spacecraft has arrived at its target asteroid, Ryugu, after a journey of nearly 2bn miles (3.2bn km), which has taken three and a half years to accomplish. The spacecraft is now tracking the 900-metre-wide asteroid, from about 12 miles above its surface. Following analysis while in orbit, Hayabusa will begin a series of touchdowns on Ryugu this autumn.During these manoeuvres the spacecraft will collect surface samples. It will also release a German-French rover, the MASCOT, which will hop across the asteroid. Next year, Hayabusa will release a 4.4lb (2kg) projectile to strike the asteroid at just over a mile a second, forming a crater. The spacecraft will shelter from the impact on the opposite side of the asteroid, the event being recorded via a remote camera. The images will let scientists witness crater formation firsthand, then allow the spacecraft to collect rock samples from the exposed material. Built by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (known as JAXA), Hayabusa2 was launched atop a Japanese H-2A rocket on 3 December 2014. It is the follow-up to the partially successful Hayabusa mission, which, in 2010, carried dust fragments from the asteroid Itokawa to Earth.

Alston’s most recent inquiries into extreme poverty have taken him to the US, China, Saudi Arabia and Ghana.“The UK has gone through a period of pretty deep budget cuts first under the coalition and then the Conservatives and I am interested to see what the outcome of that has been,” Alston told the . “I am also interested to look at what seems to be a renewed debate on all sides about the need to increase spending at least for some of the key programmes.”He said the challenges facing the UK were different to the US, where he has concluded Trump’s policies were “tailor-made to maximise inequality and to plunge millions of working Americans, and those unable to work, into penury”.Alston said: “In the UK, things are at a different place where there is no great budget surplus to be mobilised. Welfare cuts have taken place but there is now an interesting debate on whether they have gone too far and what measures need to be taken to shore up the NHS and other programmes.”Alston has not yet determined exactly what he will focus on and will shortly invite submissions from groups who want to suggest matters for him to consider. They could include housing squalour, insecurity at work, in-work poverty, mental health and political disenfranchisement. Alston will arrive as survivors and residents continue to give evidence to the public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower disaster. Many have said they felt their views and needs were ignored or marginalised by the local authority.“Poverty is often characterised by a lack of political power, by a difficulty in enjoying even basic civil and political rights,” said Alston.The Institute for Fiscal Studies this month found that people with longstanding mental health problems in the UK were more than twice as likely to be in poverty as those without a longstanding health problem. Destitution, however, has fallen over the past two years, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, although there are fears that the universal credit scheme could reverse those gains. Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said Alston would see a changed picture of poverty in the UK. “Twenty years ago, poverty in Britain was concentrated among pensioners and workless households,” he said. “Now poverty has moved into the workplace with more than half of the children growing up in poverty in working households.”Meghan Campbell, the deputy director of the Oxford Human Rights Hub, cited Brexit as a looming issue because employment protections were threatened by withdrawal from the European Union. She said rising costs of child and elderly care would particularly affect the ability of women to be economically independent. Alston said: “No one is suggesting the conditions in the UK are those of a poor developing country, but every rich country, as my mission to the US showed, has pockets of poverty everywhere. “The government statistics and a erse array of civil society organisations would suggest the UK does have important challenges dealing with poverty.”The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, welcomed Alston’s plan to consider the impact of austerity.“Austerity is a political choice made by Tory-led governments that cut spending on vital public services whilst, at the same time, handing out tax giveaways for giant corporations and the super-rich,” he said. “Only last year, a separate UN investigation concluded that Tory spending cuts trampled on the human rights of disabled people, whilst the Institute for Fiscal Studies forecasts child poverty to hit record levels in the next few years.”Previous UN missions to the UK have been highly controversial. In 2013, Raquel Rolnik, the UN rapporteur on housing, proposed the government suspend cuts to what it calls the spare room subsidy but is widely known as the bedroom tax and affects residents of social housing with spare rooms. Her report was dismissed as “a Marxist diatribe” by the then housing minister Kris Hopkins.Alston is an Australian international human rights law expert currently based at New York University. When he toured the US, he studied homelessness on Skid Row in Los Angeles, poverty in African-American areas in Alabama and the stricken coal country of West Virginia. He has been a UN rapporteur since 2004 and has specialised in extreme poverty and human rights for the past four years.A government spokesperson said: “The UK has a close working relationship with UN bodies and is committed to upholding the rule of law and rules-based international system. The UK has a standing invitation to all special rapporteurs, and it is UK government policy to accept and facilitate such visits, and to encourage other UN member states to do the same.“Household incomes have never been higher and there are one million fewer people living in absolute poverty than in 2010, including 300,000 children. Poverty rates are falling while the employment rate is increasing which is really encouraging, and we’re committed to ensuring that every child gets the very best chances in life.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/646592ecdc0ad5895131d0506e5f652c1bb5e3f8/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fe4b434451dccf94844c9077e6019e1","title":"poorer areas of england have more fast food shops figures show","story":"Health agency calls on councils to consider imposing limits to help reduce obesityAlmost half of the fast-food outlets in England are in the most deprived parts of the country, figures show, raising fresh concerns about child obesity in poorer areas. In light of the disparity, the health agency has called on local authorities to consider restricting the growth of fast-food outlets near schools, parks and other places where children gather, citing concerns about child obesity in deprived areas. In April, leading paediatricians called on the government to ban fast-food outlets from opening within 400 metres of schools. More than a third of children in England are overweight or obese by the time they leave primary school, and the proportion is higher in more deprived areas.Dr Alison Tedstone, PHE’s chief nutritionist, said: “It’s not surprising some children find it difficult to resist the lure of fast-food outlets when many neighbourhoods are saturated with them.“Local authorities have the power to help shape our environment and support people in making healthier choices. They need to question whether these fast-food hotspots are compatible with their work to help families and young children live healthier lives.” The Local Government Association called for more planning powers for councils to help break up existing groups of takeaway restaurants on high streets, and said authorities were working with businesses to create healthier menus. Izzi Seccombe, chair of the LGA’s community wellbeing board, said: “Councils appreciate that a flourishing hospitality sector in our towns and cities is good for local economies, and where they have introduced restrictions on takeaways are working with businesses to help create healthier menus for their customers.“Numerous councils have set curbs on new fast-food outlets but current legislation means they lack planning powers to tackle the clustering of existing takeaways already open. New legislation is needed to empower councils to help drive forward an effective redesign of damaging food environments to help address health inequalities and tackle the obesity crisis, which requires a joined-up approach.”The figures show significant variation in the number of fast-food outlets in different parts of England, ranging from zero in some wards to more than 100 in others. Some local authorities have formed “healthier zones” in response to obesity concerns, limiting the number of fast-food outlets in places with high levels of deprivation and near schools, community centres, playgrounds and open spaces. According to PHE, overweight and obese children are consuming up to 500 extra calories a day. It said creating healthier environments was an important part of dealing with health and obesity inequalities. Childhood obesity increases the risk of being overweight later in life and suffering from preventable diseases such as type-2 diabetes, heart disease and a number of cancers. Around a quarter of the 207,617 eateries in England are fast-food outlets, the majority of which are run by independent companies that own one or two outlets. The government aims to halve childhood obesity by 2030 and is consulting on introducing mandatory calorie labelling on menus in all restaurants.

It resulted in a 15-point swing in Hamilton’s favour.Mercedes had brought their new, upgraded engine to France, one race later than Ferrari had introduced their power unit in Canada. The extra time allowed the team to improve the new specification to a greater extent than had been intended.Hamilton has won only once in Austria since its grand prix returned to the calendar in 2014 but is hopeful of a better return this weekend. Mercedes have brought their first major aerodynamic upgrade to Spielberg and in a season that is likely to be decided by a highly competitive development battle, it could prove to be a crucial.“The development race is always tight and up until now, we haven’t had a lot of development parts on the car,” Hamilton said. “I’m aware the guys are working harder and harder to ensure we bring quality rather than quantity, so it’s great to see some new bits this weekend. I’m excited to try them on track. I know how hard everyone is working back at the factory to make sure we bring the good stuff. It will undoubtedly help us.”Hamilton is conscious his fight with Vettel is finely balanced and is maintaining his focus on the difference he can make. “I just think about how can I get the car in the right ballpark so I can do what I do. Hopefully the developments will help me do it more,” he said, while acknowledging that qualifying would be key. “Everyone has some sort of upgrades. I anticipate it being one of the closest qualifying sessions we’ve had this season. That’s my feeling.”The changes are focused largely on the Mercedes’ side pods and the rear wing and represent a strong push to steal a march on Ferrari.With the following grand prix at Silverstone, where Hamilton has been dominant with four wins from the past four races, extending his lead further at the Red Bull Ring would put him in a commanding position going into the final European races, where he has traditionally been strong.The four-times world champion has been critical of the difficulty to overtake that the current generation of cars present but said the sport is heading in the right direction but that greater competition at the front remained key as F1 considers new regulations for 2021.“Karting is wheel-to-wheel racing. That’s what got me invested in racing and really caught my heart, it’s where the passion is,” Hamilton said. “That’s what I want. I want F1 to continue to be moving in this direction, and more teams involved, and everyone getting closer and closer. I feel that means the difference I can make in the sport can be seen more, I can utilise it more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/368233e5d2bb28edc94585fbbd137df78ecbd0b7/276_300_2801_1681/master/2801.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e2514f444f1688df1121c77c71cf339","title":"wigan leeds super league match report","story":"• Wigan 46-8 Leeds• Uninspired Leeds in danger of another relegation battleBrian McDermott admitted he was concerned after Leeds endured yet another defeat. Never before had the reigning champions lost seven successive league games in the modern era, and it did not take long herefor it to become apparent the Rhinos were about to create an unwanted record.This defeat leaves them hovering above the competition’s bottom four, who will split from the rest in a month’s time to fight against relegation with the Championship’s best in the Qualifiers. In 2016 Leeds’s presence in that mini-league was shocking. To be there two years from the past three would be unthinkable.But it is perhaps the nature of this defeat to second-placed Wigan which will be most concerning. Leeds had improved of late but by half-time they were 22-4 behind after being comprehensively outplayed, and matters only got worse.Such was the nature of their performance it prompted the usually positive McDermott to tell it like it was. “I could give you some cliches and they would be true – but if you’re asking me if I’m concerned then yes, for sure,” he said.Though Leeds took the lead through Brett Ferres’s early try, by half-time two tries for Liam Marshall and another for Josh Woods – the teenage half-back who was magnificent for the home side – had established a commanding advantage which Wigan did not surrender.The Rhinos’ performance only worsened after the interval. The moment Liam Farrell strode through a huge gap in Leeds’ defence to touch down underlined the gulf between the two sides, before the Rhinos topped that by throwing two wild passes in midfield in the final moments which were picked off by Wigan players and eventually finished by Marshall and Tom Davies.There were moments of promise for Leeds, Joel Moon’s late try among them. But the champions are running out of excuses as well as time. On this form Leeds may need the sides below them to keep losing should they wish to avoid the Qualifiers this summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a6767e44094da391df71782a8a89eb67d12dd0e/0_201_3488_2094/master/3488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb5556e5570a0aadb5f1362924274a1a","title":"womens cricket england new zealand","story":"On the back of a fine fielding display England’s women cantered to a comprehensive seven-wicket victory over New Zealand in a dress rehearsal for Sunday’s T20 tri-series final. Three impressive outfield catches and a nifty legside stumping contributed to the visitors falling 11 balls short of batting out their overs. Set 130, Heather Knight’s side lost both openers inside the power play but were steered to victory by Sarah Taylor and Nat Sciver doing as they pleased for 51 and 39 not out respectively. The win came with 25 balls to spare.The White Ferns’ collapse of eight for 43 was fatal, especially after losing Suzie Bates for a duck in the first over. That was the first of Amy Jones’ contributions patrolling the boundary, ing forward to snaffle the opener to give Anya Shrubsole the first of her three victims.Taylor, who with Sciver scored 81 of the 108 runs they needed to win when coming together, started her night with a standing reverse leg glance. It was not long before she was targeting the sightscreen at the other end with powerful drives in a half-century that took 35 balls. Sciver was more conventional but no less effective, muscling 39 from 31 deliveries, seeing the chase through with Knight enjoying an 11-ball cameo making 24 not out.In the earlier rubber of the doubleheader Bates and Sophie Devine all but eliminated South Africa on their own in adding 130 for the first wicket in pursuit of 149. This second time round against the hosts, the latter added another half-century (52) but only two of her colleagues joined her in double figures. Even that should not have been so. Turning out for England for the first time on home soil, the zippy 19-year-old southpaw Katie George hit Devine’s edge with her first ball only for it to be put down by Taylor. But her first international wicket would come in her second spell, trapping Amy Satterthwaite (38) lbw to break her stand of 58 with Devine that set the collapse in motion.Between times fellow teenager Sophie Ecclestone provided a moment of concern when turning an ankle minutes after trapping Katey Martin with her second delivery. The Lancastrian left the field in distress but was back to continue bowling later in the innings. A second wonderful ing effort from Jones got Shrubsole into the book again, this time moving fast and low to her right at long-on. Then, sure enough, Taylor redeemed herself from her earlier drop with her third legside stumping of the summer to stall Jess Watkin’s counterattack. Danielle Hazell also cashed in with two well-earned wickets as the Kiwi innings fell apart.Stuck at the non-strikers’ end far too often, Devine moved to 50 in 41 balls before Sciver popped up for the third excellent take with both feet off the ground at deep midwicket, delivering Shrubsole her third wicket to end the New Zealand innings prematurely.When the openers, Danielle Wyatt and Tammy Beaumont, holed out from the spin of Watkin, the visitors had a chance. But it was only a brief one. The sides now travel to the ground they call Fortress Chelmsford, where England have not lost a T20 in seven attempts. Having taken the points in three of four group games, and doing the double over New Zealand, the hosts enter the final as deserved favourites."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e0e1ecb2148ad8d0c279c3f0c0076015dd4c023/0_205_3844_2306/master/3844.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04490f6da4dde6618f2bd53fd4f0a8db","title":"facebook patent phone mic listening tv shows","story":"System would allow Facebook to identify what adults and children are watching based on ambient noiseFacebook has patented a system that can remotely activate the microphone on someone’s phone using inaudible signals broadcast via a television.The patent application describes a system where an audio fingerprint embedded in TV shows or ads, inaudible to human ears, would trigger the phone, tablet or long-rumoured smart speaker to turn on the microphone and start recording “ambient audio of the content item”. The recording could then be matched to a database of content to allow Facebook to identify what the inidual was watching – like Shazam for TV, but without the inidual choosing to activate the system. Diagrams accompanying the patent highlight how the technology would know which adult or child within a household was watching a particular broadcast.The patent, first spotted by the New York Times, positions the technology as a way for broadcasters to know exactly who is watching their TV shows or ads and for how long. The same system could then be used to build viewing profiles of inidual members of a household for better content recommendation and more targeted advertising.Privacy experts are concerned about the intrusion into people’s homes, particularly as the ambient audio recording would likely catch snippets of people’s private conversations without their knowledge.“It’s extremely disconcerting for privacy to have an inaudible beacon as it means they want to make it not obvious to the user that the device is listening,” said William Budington, a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.Such a system could also give Facebook a better understanding of people’s social connections as it would show the social network which people were meeting up in real life.Facebook was quick to downplay the patent filing. “It is common practice to file patents to prevent aggression from other companies. Because of this, patents tend to focus on future-looking technology that is often speculative in nature and could be commercialised by other companies,” said Facebook’s head of intellectual property, Allen Lo, in a statement.“The technology in this patent has not been included in any of our products, and never will be.”Facebook isn’t the first company to design a system that uses secretly broadcast audio signals to track people’s viewing habits. In 2015, a company called SilverPush developed ultrasonic audio “beacons” within TV commercials that could be identified by any device running apps that incorporated SilverPush’s software.The system allows for far more accurate tracking of people’s viewing habits at an inidual level.In March 2016, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued warning letters to app developers who had installed the software encouraging them to notify people that their app could allow third parties to monitor their viewing habits.“These apps were capable of listening in the background and collecting information about consumers without notifying them,” said Jessica Rich, the director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “Companies should tell people what information is collected, how it is collected, and who it’s shared with.”Less than a week later, SilverPush announced it was killing the tracking software to move into “new areas of growth and profitability”.The idea that Facebook already listens to people’s conversations and uses that information to deliver targeted advertising has been a popular conspiracy theory for years. It appeared to originate in May 2014 when the company launched a feature called “Identify TV and Music”, which listened to ambient noise when a user was writing a status update – with their permission.

The show, billed as “an adult fantasy about a crumbling medieval kingdom known as Dreamland”, marks Groening’s first new project in nearly two decades, since Futurama premiered in 1999.The 10-episode series, which is also Groening’s first production away from Fox, stars Broad City’s Abbi Jacobson as a boozy princess named Bean, flanked by her sidekicks Elfo, voiced by Nat Faxon, and Luci, played by the comic Eric Andre. There are seasoned voice actors involved, too, including Futurama’s John DiMaggio, Billy West, Maurice LaMarche, David Herman, Tress MacNeille, Jeny Batten, Rich Fulcher, Noel Fielding and Lucy Montgomery.“In Disenchantment, viewers will be whisked away to the crumbling medieval kingdom of Dreamland, where they will follow the misadventures of hard-drinking young princess Bean, her feisty elf companion Elfo and her personal demon Luci,” reads the official summary for Disenchantment. “Along the way, the oddball trio will encounter ogres, sprites, harpies, imps, trolls, walruses and lots of human fools.”Although the teaser, which runs a brief 45 seconds, gives away little of the show’s plot, it does reference Groening’s past work, which has nabbed him 12 Emmy awards including 10 for The Simpsons. “You’ve seen the future in Futurama, you’ve seen the present in Springfield,” says the voiceover. “So, what’s the obvious third move? The past, of course.”In a statement last summer, Groening described the show, which has been picked up for 20 episodes, as a show “about life and death, love and sex, and how to keep laughing in a world full of suffering and idiots, despite what the elders and wizards and other jerks tell you”.Disenchantment, which will be available on Netflix on 17 August, will be co-executive-produced by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, frequent collaborators of Groening’s. In April, The Simpsons became television’s longest-running scripted series when it aired its 636th episode."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fac4a123031cc96e760689928d17e36536f47f65/93_90_3345_2007/master/3345.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6da2f5a7291bd23f3964d4f45bb7a8e3","title":"queer eye netflix series best fab five makeovers","story":"Two quickfire seasons have made it one of this year’s standout shows, but which were the best episodes?While things in the US are ided politically more than ever, at least there are five queer dudes who are trying to bridge the gap between the scruffy rural everyman and the urban elites who sometimes look down on them. It’s as if the Fab Five on Netflix’s hit revival of Queer Eye are trying to Make America Gay Again. So far the technique is working. Not only are they showing dudes how to put pomade in their hair (start from the back and work forward), the finer points of a french tuck, or how to slice up an avocado, they’re also getting them to challenge their political beliefs and change the courses of their lives for the better. We’ve ranked all of the makeovers so far over the two seasons in descending order.If this episode doesn’t make you cry then you should get one of those dry-eye medications. AJ is a (hunky) guy who hasn’t come out to his family despite the fact that he has a boyfriend. Not only did the crew give him a new haircut and wardrobe, they also changed his apartment from a schlubby, unusable mess into a cute crashpad. But it’s these five guys showing him he can be masculine and openly gay that really makes this episode memorable. That and the amazing scene where …There is nothing sadder than a lonely guy smoking out of the door of his basement room while drinking whiskey and Mountain Dew. The Fab Five made his space nice, gave him some new clothes and shaped his beard, but the real impact here was shaping his life. Not only did they expose him to gay people for the first time, they imbued him with the confidence in his appearance and himself that he had lost. The coda to the episode is that he ends up reuniting with the ex-wife who still had his heart. There was no worse apartment than Skyler’s, the trans man whose house was festooned with more rainbow flags and LGBT paraphernalia than all the gift shops in Provincetown. The Fab Five did a number on it and spiffed up his look, though it seems like the improvements didn’t take. But Skyler learning what it’s like to blend masculine and feminine energies to create a whole and unique person is a journey that is worth watching again and again. The doyenne of Gay, Georgia, Tammye is a woman who gives until her heart can’t give any more. The guys didn’t do much apart from give her a new haircut and a cute dress to wear to church, however they helped repair the relationship between her and her gay son. Tammye talking about her struggles with reconciling her religion and her son is the sort of message so many parents need to hear. One thing you should never do to a cop down south is shave off his moustache. How else are we going to know that he’s 5-0? This was a guy who lives for Nascar races and didn’t think much of his clothing or his home decor. The Fab Five changed that, but the most memorable scene was this policeman’s talk with Karamo Brown, who is African American, about Black Lives Matter. It was the sort of honest, heartfelt discussion between an African American and a member of the law enforcement community that needs to happen a lot more often if we want serious change. Ah, yes, the hunky firefighters episode. Jeremy, the main subject, is a great and giving guy who wanted his station house remodelled for all his colleagues who risk their lives to keep the community safe. While the new duds weren’t that remarkable, what Bobby Berk did to their sad office was. This episode showed that a group of guys – gay, straight or otherwise – can come together and learn from each other, no matter what misconceptions they may have. In the most shocking transformation of the series so far, this tech nerd went from looking like Mike Myers in The Love Guru to a handsome young professional. For that, he can thank Jonathan Van Ness’s supreme skills as a barber. His story of growing up and accepting responsibility is a common one, but most of them don’t come with a guy who ends up looking this fly. This handyman started the episode as a “Burner” who wants to move to Reno, Nevada, for a fresh start in life and ended a “Burner” who decided to stay in Atlanta for a woman he fell in love with. With a decent taste in furniture and clothes to start with, all the guys had to teach him was how to show off his assets. Once he had that confidence, he was able to decide against an ill-advised move and find a relationship that was lurking right under his nose. No number of trips to Burning Man could do that.This is the one with the guy who was a big fat liar. Was he employed or not? Did he graduate college or didn’t he? Is he ever going to stop eating sunflower seeds and spitting the shells out into a Frisbee? Man, we sure hope he does. Cleaned up a little bit and finally held accountable for his actions, he got back the confidence to stop lying to his family and himself – at least for now. I loved Remy’s grandmother’s retro 70s house and was sad they tore down all of her photo murals. The only thing I loved more was Remy’s updated house after all of those period furnishings were gone. His own style transformation wasn’t that dramatic, but updating that house was like breaking apart the fatberg – a near-insurmountable job that required all hands on deck. The young mayor of a small but progressive town in Georgia is the face of #resist. No, really. He started growing his beard the day Hillary Clinton lost the election and hadn’t shaved it off. Having him get rid of that and wear something other than tattered sneakers when on city business was a major accomplishment. This was the guy who has a bunch of kids crammed into a tiny house and works almost 20 hours a day to keep all of those mouths fed. He’s also very religious, which was a particular challenge for Bobby Berk, who was shunned by his Evangelical family after he came out. Their discussion about religion and its accepting people of all sexualities was the highlight of an otherwise forgettable episode. Sometimes all these guys need is a haircut, a shave and to be told they can’t keep dressing like a high-school stoner. They usually have an obstacle to overcome too, but Leo’s was one of the lamest of all: he doesn’t have any friends who are dads. Oh, boo hoo. This guy who works at Walmart loves his girlfriend like Mary Berry loves a well-baked victoria sponge. The pair got some new furniture and walls for their trailer and he got some spiffy new outfits, but there wasn’t much to this one. Yes, he proposed at the end, but these two are so over-the-top affectionate that we knew how she would respond. Remember how unfunny Joe was during his standup act? Really not funny. At least he finally moved out of his childhood bedroom and into his own place. Oh no, wait. He moved down into his parents’ basement. Wow, this just gets bleaker and bleaker.They tried so hard to help this 18-year-old home-schooled kid one his way to college, but there wasn’t much to be done. While everyone was happy he got rid of the blazers with his name emblazoned on the back, there just wasn’t much change happening this time around.

After all, when he was told that there had been a shooting at the Capital, his initial response was to think of Maryland’s state capital in the heart of downtown Annapolis.To him, the Capital Gazette “reports on our kids’ soccer games and good, local, interesting stuff that we want to hear about” and he could not understand how “that could make someone that hostile”.He said earlier: “This paper is not a liberal newspaper, it’s not a right wing newspaper, it stays in the middle and covers local issues,” he said.Buckley also expressed his concern that it was a targeted attack on the media. “If this is an attack on journalism it is a sad state of affairs,” said the first-term mayor. “Because journalists, you don’t get paid enough to put your life on the line, we’re not in some war zone, we’re not in some third-world country with a dictator. We are in a Mayberry kind of town, we’re in shock we’re going to be grappling with.”Annapolis, Maryland’s state capital, is one of the oldest cities in the country and noted for its historic downtown and scenic wharfs. Buckley, an Australian American restaurateur, noted “We’re such an accepting community they’ll even let an Australian be their mayor here.”He went out of his way though to praise the police response, with officers said to have arrived in less than a minute. “I can tell you they saved lives by being there as fast as they were,” he told the . “They put their own lives in danger to do this and people need to know that that’s what emergency responders do. They are selfless.” Buckley added: “These guys, they weren’t thinking about if the guy had a grenade, a semi-automatic weapon or a rifle. They just knew they had to get him.”A Democrat who recently spoke at the March for our Lives, Buckley warned: “We can’t numb ourselves to this stuff. We have to say enough is enough.”More broadly, Capital Gazette journalists expressed disgust at the lack of action coming from Washington over the latest gun outrage.The staff writer Selene San Felice responded to news that Donald Trump had extended “thoughts and prayers” to the victims. She told CNN: “I’m not trying to make this political, but we need more than prayers. I want your prayers, but I want something else.”Felice added: “This is going to be a story for how many days? Less than a week? People will forget about us in less than a week. I’m going to need more than a couple of days of news coverage and thoughts and prayers – our whole lives have been shattered.”The Baltimore Sun, the sister newspaper of the Capital Gazette, released an editorial pointing to the atmosphere of hostility toward journalism at present in the US. “At a time of political isiveness when views of the news industry itself have become starkly polarised, many jumped quickly to speculation about whether the metaphorical war on the media had become shockingly literal ... That’s why so many reporters across the nation got a sickening feeling Thursday afternoon – they couldn’t believe something like this had happened, except that they could.”During a police press conference, Pat Furgurson, a veteran journalist for the Capital Gazette, stood behind the police in an untucked blue shirt and rumpled khakis, recording audio and even getting in a question.Afterwards, Furgurson briefly talked to his fellow reporters. Visibly shaken, he said the victims were “just trying to do their job for the public. Something like this might happen in Afghanistan or Iraq or something like that but you don’t expect it in a sleepy office across the street from a local mall.” However he insisted “we’re still putting out a newspaper” and that the Capital Gazette would be out on Friday. Asked if he had any message for others, Furguson choked up and paused for a minute. He then said “what’s so funny about peace, love and understanding” and walked away. After all, he had a story to file."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ce1f3cb377e0a8c6636b417be06746dea792679/0_157_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6a0c4f795b7d05cc7556b993ad2633d","title":"former pakistan prime minister barred from re election","story":"Ban on former leader Shahid Khaqan Abbasi raises prospect of military interferencePakistan’s former prime minister and a member of his cabinet have been controversially barred from contesting next month’s general election.It is the latest in a series of blows to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party that have fuelled accusations the country’s military is trying to deny the party a second term.On Thursday, the supreme court found the former privatisation minister Daniyal Aziz guilty of contempt, disqualifying him from parliament for five years.The verdict came one day after an election tribunal barred ex-prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi from contesting his home-constituency of Murree. A single-judge bench ruled that Abbasi was “guilty of concealment of facts” on election papers and therefore disqualified from politics for life under article 62 of Pakistan’s constitution.That clause, which requires politicians to be “honest and righteous”, was also used in 2017 by the supreme court to justify the ousting of prime minister Nawaz Sharif.Sharif, who has opposed the military establishment since he was removed from office in a 1999 coup, is calling on voters to back the PML-N on 25 July in the face of what leaders describe as a familiar conspiracy between the army and the judiciary.Aziz told the  the charges against him were “flimsy”. “There has been a long history of mangling the democratic process by state institutions,” he said, using a common codeword for the army. “Here I am, Mr Clean, and I’m pulled up on flimsy charges drummed up from a year ago.” The supreme court had objected to Aziz claiming the court was following a “script” in its ruling against Sharif.Mosharraf Zaidi, a Pakistan commentator, told the  that the remarks Aziz made constituted little more than “overheated political rhetoric,”, adding that he worried the series of unexpected twists ahead of the vote was undermining public faith in the electoral system.In an appearance on television on Wednesday night to discuss his own dismissal, Abbasi said: “It’s an election for parliament. They have made it a joke.”The tribunal ruled that he had made an error in his declaration of the value of his home in Islamabad. According to Abbasi, who will appeal against the ruling, the value he set down legitimately represented the cost at which the property was purchased in 1974. He further claimed the election tribunal went beyond its remit in applying article 62.Legal experts were ided over whether Abbasi can still run for the second seat he is contesting in Islamabad.Several leaders from the main opposition party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), have also been knocked out of contention under the same clause in the constitution.However, analysts note a preponderance of verdicts against the PML-N. Earlier in the week, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), an anti-graft court, arrested another PML-N candidate, Qamarul Islam, shortly after he announced he would contest a seat against the pro-military former interior minister.On Wednesday, Islam’s 12-year-old son was driven around the constituency in his place, hailing supporters via megaphone through the vehicle’s sunroof.The NAB is widely expected to convict Sharif on charges of corruption in the coming days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce1f81c69b576bc00460aecd908d8e12d0f82fb8/1183_841_2031_1219/master/2031.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a93ffad9c80959af60fcdf7d68fa6ee4","title":"eu leaders summit migration doubts","story":"Italy’s Conte ‘satisfied’ but Angela Merkel still needs to convince coalition partners she has a way to control immigration • EU leaders claim migration deal breakthrough - live updatesEuropean leaders papered over the isions on migration with a promise that some EU countries would take in migrants rescued from the Mediterranean sea, after marathon talks at an EU summit lasting nearly 10 hours.Announcing the end of tense summit talks shortly before dawn, the head of the European Council, Donald Tusk, tweeted that EU leaders had reached an agreement, including on migration.Hours earlier that outcome had been in doubt, when Italy threatened to veto the entire text, unless other EU states did more to help with people arriving on Italian shores. Opposition from Poland, Hungary and other central European states to any hint of mandatory action meant talks dragged through the night.Italy’s new prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said: “We are satisfied. It was a long negotiation but from today Italy is no longer alone.” But the bloc dodged an agreement on controversial refugee quotas, as a quartet of central European countries resisted language on EU-wide responsibility. The outcome is already being seen as a thin deal. It also looked doubtful whether Angela Merkel has a deal that will secure the future of her coalition government, which has been rocked by disputes over handling refugees.On leaving the summit, the German chancellor conceded that “we still have a lot of work to do to bridge the different views”, but said it was “a good signal” that the EU had agreed a common text. Merkel had warned on Thursday that the future of the European Union hinged on whether it could find answers to the “vital questions” posed by migration.Leaders agreed EU countries should help migrants rescued in the Mediterranean to alleviate the burden on Italy and Greece, but the details remained unclear. The issue has risen to the fore, since Italy closed its ports to migrant rescue ships, leaving several boats adrift at sea, until other countries stepped in to help.In an effort to avoid a chaotic situation, leaders agreed there should be “a shared effort”, but “only on a voluntary basis”. Countries will take in rescued migrants and establish processing centres to assess asylum claims on their soil.In an attempt to force the issue, Italy’s new leader Giuseppe Conte was accused of hijacking the summit, when he threatened to block the entire summit conclusions, unless he received more help.“I am a law professor,” Conte told his fellow leaders, protesting about the EU’s working methods, promoting an unusual exchange, according to a source. Bulgarian prime minister Boyko Borissov replied: “Well I used to be a fireman and this is not how you negotiate.” Sweden’s prime minister, Stefan Lӧfven, chipped in, adding that he used to be a welder and he didn’t agree with the Italian’s way of making his point either.The summit exposed Europe’s longstanding isions on migration between central Europe, which refuses to take any refugees, versus western countries, which are seeking “solidarity” even in a token way.Finding a more consensual note, EU leaders called for migrant processing centres in north African countries. They agreed to “swiftly explore the concept of regional platforms in close cooperation” with non-EU countries and the UN refugee agency and the International Organisation for Migration, also a UN-backed agency.In essence, this means migrant processing centres in countries, such as Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Niger and Tunisia. EU funds would be available to persuade countries to sign on, but so far no countries have agreed, while a couple have ruled themselves out.In a sign of the political complexities involved, the UN agency vision for the scheme clashes with those of some EU leaders, who put the accent on closing borders and stopping arrivals. Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orbán, called for a “strong border” to stop what he called an “invasion” of migrants.In contrast, the UNHCRIOM paper seen by the  calls for “strong leadership from European Union member states on upholding the right to asylum and the rights of migrants”, while stressing that the EU cannot outsource the problem.“The idea is really not us and them, either Europe or North Africa,” Eugenio Ambrosi, Europe director for the International Organization for Migration, told the . “It is a Mediterranean approach that is shared by those countries that are willing.”“What we do not want is external processing centres and we definitely do not want an Australian model,” he said, referring to controversial detention centres on Pacific islands.Conte said his government had not decided whether to set up a migrant processing centre and had not been urged to do so. But the first test from the summit may be for Merkel, who needs to convince her conservative coalition partners that she has a way to control migrants travelling to Germany from southern countries. Germany’s hardline interior minister Horst Seehofer, who is also the leader of the CSU, has threatened to close Germany’s borders to refugees, unless Merkel comes up with a plan by 1 July.This has prompted fears that closing Germany’s frontier would lead to domino effect of closures, destroying the border-free travel area that underpins a lot of jobs and trade.At the summit EU leaders also agreed to roll over wide-ranging economic sanctions against Russia, an outcome that had been in doubt, following the recent election of Italy’s populist government that is more sympathetic to Vladimir Putin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1c612d731094984b7cfc4189a8798072bb41067/0_293_2568_1541/master/2568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d9b788868e1bd75c9a593af7a4742a8","title":"italian officials allegedly met with syrias top military adviser","story":"Legal claim against Italy filed at the European commission alleges violation of EU rulesA secret meeting that is alleged to have taken place between a senior military adviser to Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, and top Italian officials has come under scrutiny from human rights organisations.Italy’s decision to host the clandestine meeting violated EU rules, the European Centre for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR) has claimed.In its legal complaint, filed against Italy at the European commission, the ECCHR has alleged a meeting took place in early 2018 between Ali Mamlouk, the head of Syria’s national security bureau, and Marco Minniti, a former intelligence chief who was serving as Italy’s interior minister at the time. It claimed the meeting violated an EU travel ban that was put in place against Mamlouk in 2011. Italy’s head of intelligence, Alberto Manenti, also allegedly attended.Initial unconfirmed reports in February stated that Italy had provided Mamlouk with a private jet to fly to Rome, but the alleged meeting was not officially recognised or announced. The ECCHR stated in its complaint that it had “received confirmation about the visit and the meetings by several government officials as well as journalistic sources”.Minniti served under the government of the former centre-left prime minister Paolo Gentiloni, who has since been replaced by the new interior minister, Matteo Salvini – the populist leader of the far-right party League. Manenti remains in his post.Reports had suggested the alleged meeting involved a discussion of national security issues.Mamlouk was singled out and placed on a “blacklist” by the EU in 2011 – a decision that put travel and financial restrictions on the military and intelligence official – because of his alleged involvement in violence against demonstrators in Syria. According to the complaint, the European council’s decision obliged all EU member states to take “necessary measures to prevent entry into, or transit through, their territories”.Mamlouk is known to be one of the most high-ranking security officials in Syria and reports directly to Assad. Human rights organisations said Mamlouk’s national security bureau was allegedly responsible for arbitrary arrests and torture, as well as the execution of Assad’s political opponents.The ECCHR added that European allies were not informed of the alleged meeting, including the high representative of foreign affairs and security policy, Federica Mogherini, who is Italian and a member of the Democratic party, which was in control of the government at the time.The Italian government – now led by a different party – did not have an immediate response to the claim.Other human rights groups, including Amnesty International, said it supported the decision to file the complaint. The groups called on the commission to initiate a formal infringement procedure against Italy, and said the Syrian government needed to be “held to account because justice shall not be set aside in the interest of intelligence cooperation”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/545bd60eb02593f0d0babab0cc3deaa84c2b7c87/0_412_7259_4356/master/7259.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3999af39e26006b4ee4252ecc1f08663","title":"mongolias shamanic rituals in pictures","story":"Banned for 70 years under communist rule, the ancient practice of shamanism has been protected by Mongolia’s constitution since 1992"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1a5651584871dc078500c3b283c2b0a69ee2a00/0_150_2352_1412/master/2352.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63cc1cfb911258a4a7293961927e06f0","title":"eu summit european leaders migration deal brexit theresa may live updates","story":"Agreement would bolster the bloc’s external borders and improve solidarity to ease pressure on nations like Greece and Italy. Follow the latest hereMore reaction is coming in from European leaders. Our Rome correspondent Stephanie Kirchgaessner has this from Italy:In Italy, the deal was hailed by prime minister Giuseppe Conte as a breakthrough.Conte said that Italy was no longer alone in dealing with the crisis on its shores. But there was – so far – no reaction on social media from the man who may matter more, the far-right interior minister Matteo Salvini. In the last 24-hours, Salvini has repeated his call for NGOs to stop saving migrants in the Mediterranean, using the hashtag #stopinvasione, stop the invasion.The Bavarian CSU, the sister party to Merkel’s CDU which had initially created the pressure for the chancellor to emerge from the summit with a new deal on migration, had already quietly switched to de-escalation mode before the German delegation headed to Brussels.Interior minister Horst Seehofer told German TV on Wednesday that while the situation was serious, the conversations that had been started were “quite sensible”. On Thursday night, former Bavarian state premier Edmund Stoiber said in a talkshow: “I am confident after hearing what is coming out of Brussels. I believe that a way can still be found”.Heads of the CSU and the CDU will meet separately in Munich and Berlin on Sunday at 3pm to debate the outcome of the Brussels summit.The BBC have tweeted photographs of the new European Commission conclusion on migration. The conclusion includes a section on rescue boats, believed to be included as a concession to Italy (see the bolded text), and an interesting paragraph declaring the establishment of “controlled centres set up in Member States ... where rapid and secure processing would occur” of those who are rescued from the sea. Here’s some of the text of the conclusion reached today:As regards the Central Mediterranean Route, efforts to stop smugglers operating out of Libya or elsewhere should be further intensified. The EU will continue to stand by Italy and other frontline Member States in this respect. It will step up its support for the Sahel region, the Libyan Coastguard, coastal and Southern communities, humane reception conditions, voluntary humanitarian returns, cooperation with other countries of origin and transit, as well as voluntary resettlement. All vessels operating in the Mediterranean must respect the applicable laws and not obstruct operations of the Libyan Coastguard.On EU territory, those who are saved, according to international law, should be taken charge of, on the basis of a shared effort, through the transfer in controlled centres set up in Member States, only on a voluntary basis, where rapid and secure processing would allow, with full EU support, to distinguish between irregular migrants, who will be returned, and those in need of international protection, for whom the principle of solidarity would apply. All the measures in the context of these controlled centres, including relocation and resettlement, will be on a voluntary basis, without prejudice to the Dublin reform.”Dimitris Avramopoulos, the EU commissioner for migration, has said the agreement reached this morning was a “positive first step towards more solidarity”.In a series of tweets in the early hours of this morning, Avramopolous called on EU member states to finalise the Common European Asylum System and to strengthen Frontex, the European border and coast guard agency.Last week, Avramopouls said the EU wanted to “intensify cooperation” with Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Niger and Morocco and announced the intention to create a “regional disembarkation scheme”, similar to the scheme discussed and agreed upon by European government leaders overnight.After a long night of talks that wrapped up at about 3am local time, leaders are expected back at 11am to begin day two of discussions. They are due to talk about Brexit today, though Theresa May has already addressed the council on the subject of Brexit, issuing a stark warning to them yesterday that their citizens’ lives will be at risk if they fail to show more flexibility on Brexit.Brussels has insisted the UK will not be able to participate in information-sharing schemes such as Ecris (European Criminal Records Information System) and Prüm, through which EU authorities track criminals and terrorists, once it is a “third country”. Yesterday, May told her fellow leaders that, if the EU continues to insist on this, Britain “will no longer be able to share real-time alerts for wanted persons, including criminals. We would be able to respond less swiftly to alerts for missing people, either side of the Channel, and reunite them with their loved ones. And our collective ability to map terrorist networks across Europe and bring those responsible to justice would be reduced. That is not what I want, and I do not believe that is what you want either”.Several papers led their coverage today with May’s warning. The Times’ splash headline was: “EU putting lives at risk over Brexit, warns May”, the Daily Express led with: “EU ‘risking lives’ in row over security”, whereas the i had: “Divided cabinet dismays Europe”.The European Council press office has shared this photo of the leaders hard at work in negotiations. Angela Merkel is in the centre on the far side of the circular table (in the jewel-green jacket).The issue of immigration – which has been long-simmering and threatened the cohesion of the EU – is of particular importance to Merkel, whose coalition government is under strain after Germany’s hardline interior minister Horst Seehofer threatened to turn away any asylum claimants already registered in another EU country, unless Merkel came up with a solution by 1 July.It is unclear whether this deal will be enough to appease the German chancellor’s critics back home.Before leaving for the EU summit, Merkel addressed the Bundestag, saying European leaders should find a solution to asylum challenges “by allowing ourselves to be guided by values and rooting for multilateralism rather than unilateralism” and that failing to do so risked creating a situation where “no one believes in the value system that has made us so strong”.For more on Merkel’s troubles at home and warnings to European leaders, read this excellent piece from my colleagues Jennifer Rankin and Philip Oltermann.European leaders have claimed to have reached a breakthrough on migration challenges, after all-night talks. Gathering in Brussels, leaders are due to turn their attention to Brexit today, but yesterday the chief subject of debate was migration, as heads of government tried to find answers to what Angela Merkel has dubbed “vital questions” posed by migration to the union.Announcing the end of tense summit talks shortly before dawn, the head of the European Council Donald Tusk tweeted that EU leaders had reached an agreement, including on migration.Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin, has been reporting through the night. She writes:Hours earlier that outcome had been in doubt, when Italy threatened to veto the entire text, unless other EU states did more to help with people arriving on Italian shores. Opposition from Poland, Hungary and other central European states to any hint of mandatory action meant talks dragged through the night.Italy’s new prime minister Giuseppe Conte said: “We are satisfied. It was a long negotiation but from today Italy is no longer alone.”But the bloc dodged an agreement on controversial refugee quotas, as a quartet of central European countries resisted language on EU-wide responsibility. “It is a thin deal,” said one senior source.The plan agreed upon aims to bolster the bloc’s external borders and improve solidarity between member states, to reduce pressure on countries like Greece, Spain and Italy, which are points of arrival into Europe.Details are hazy, but the plan seems to involve establishing screening centers in North Africa, where asylum eligibility is assessed. European Union funds would be used to persuade the countries to sign on. At present no north African countries have suggested they would be willing to participate.Leaders also agreed that EU countries should help migrants rescued in the Mediterranean to alleviate the burden on Italy and Greece – an issue that has come to the fore since Italy closed its ports to migrant rescue ships – but details of how this would work remained unclear.On leaving the summit the German chancellor conceded that “we still have a lot of work to do to bridge the different views,” but said it was “a good signal” that the EU had agreed a common text, Jennifer Rankin reports. Merkel had warned on Thursday that the future of the European Union hinged on whether it could find answers to the “vital questions” posed by migration.We will be bringing you more news from the EU summit, plus other political news, opinion and analysis throughout the day.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillA residents group campaigning against the development of more than 500 homes on playing pitches beside St Anne’s Park in north Dublin has said it is delighted that its legal challenge has been accepted. The action taken by Clonres CLG, which represents residents from the Clontarf area, and two environmentalists, was the first challenge to a decision made under the State’s new “fast-track” planning system for large-scale housing developments.Mr Justice David Barniville was told by Fintan Valentine BL, for the board, that it would agree to an order quashing the permission.The application was made under the new Strategic Housing Development “fast-track” planning system. This allows applications for schemes of more than 100 homes to be made directly to An Bord Pleanála, bypassing the local authority decision phase.The new system,designed to remove planning “blockages” to the construction of homes to address the housing crises, came into effect one year ago, but only a small number of applications have yet been processed by the board.The Crekav decision was the first to be subject to a judicial review, the only form of appeal open to third parties under the new system. The judge adjourned to matter to next month to allow the parties consider what the board had said. The board is likely to state at this point whether it proposes to reassess the application, or to issue a refusal of permission.Deirdre Nichol, of Clonres said the residents were “delighted” by the board’s decision to conceded. “We feel vindicated by the fact that we took the judicial review, which as a residents association we did not do lightly,” she said. “Our hope would be that these lands would be protected going forward and they would revest back to their use up to now as playing fields, and for the use of the geese and other endangered species.”The board, and representatives of Crekav, said they could not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.Brendan Slattery, a planning expert at law firm McCann FitzGerald, said while the first strategic housing decision to be challenged had “fallen without a fight” it did not mean the planning process was flawed . “The reason An Bord Pleanála has conceded is very narrow and has nothing to do with the new accelerated planning process. The strategic housing process remains the most effective vehicle for securing a timely planning decision,” he said. It was positive he said, that a new faster court system had brought the error to light early.“The silver lining is that the expedited court procedures made sure this issue surfaced quickly. The permission was granted in April, the challenges were commenced in May and the board has conceded an error within four weeks. That kind of early action is uncommon.”"},{"url":null,"title":"national geographic travel photographer year 2018 pictures","story":"The 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest recognises spectacular photos taken within the last two years, with entries in three categories: Nature, People and Cities. REIKO TAKAHASHI - National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year Contest - Mermaid I was fortunate to have encountered a humpback whale with her calf on my first day snorkeling near Japan’s Kumejima Island.

talks tense summit","story":"digitalservices@telegraphdigitalservices@telegraphEuropean leaders struggled to overcome deep isions on migration at a tense EU summit that dragged into the early morning hours of Friday before yielding vague pledges to strengthen external borders and explore new migrant centres.The meeting in Brussels, dominated by a nine-hour dinner, underscored how Europe\u0027s 2015 sharp rise in immigration continues to haunt the bloc despite a sharp drop in arrivals of people fleeing conflict and economic hardship in the Middle East and Africa.It took place in an atmosphere of political crisis, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel under intense political pressure at home and a new eurosceptic Italian government threatening to torpedo any deal that did not meet its demands.A bleary-eyed Mrs Merkel, speaking to reporters at 5 am, tried to put a positive spin on the result, saying it was a good signal that leaders had been able to agree a common text on the controversial migration issue.But she acknowledged that the bloc still had a lot of work to do to bridge the different views.Italy is not alone anymore, said Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.French President Emmanuel Macron said European cooperation had won the day.Speaking shortly after 5am in Brussels, Prime Minister Theresa May acknowledged there had been lengthy discussions on the EU\u0027s approach.We have come to positive conclusions, a lot of them around what the United Kingdom has been encouraging for some time, which is taking more action upstream in countries of origin so that we can ensure that people aren\u0027t having to make and aren\u0027t making these very dangerous journeys, often travelling many miles, often at the hands of the people smugglers and making the dangerous trips across the Mediterranean where we still see some people dying.Germany\u0026#39s Chancellor Angela Merkel (C) reacts as she speaks with European Council President Donald Tusk (L) and Spain\u0026#39s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez during an European Union leaders\u0026#39 summitIn a final statement full of convoluted language meant to satisfy the ergent views, the leaders agreed to set up joint asylum processing sites and restrict migrant moves within the bloc, but they made clear that virtually all of their pledges would be carried out on a voluntary basis by member states.They also agreed to tighten their external border and increase financing for Turkey, Morocco and other North African states to prevent migration to Europe.It was unclear whether the deal would prove sufficient to appease Merkel\u0027s coalition partner, the Christian Social Union (CSU), which has threatened to shut Bavaria\u0027s border to migrants -- a move which could trigger the collapse of her three-month-old government as well as the EU\u0027s Schengen zone of free travel.Diplomats described a tense, tortured meeting with small groups of leaders huddled together in a desperate bid to break the deadlock and avert the humiliation of heading home without having produced an agreement.Early in the evening, Merkel and Conte set aside 45 minutes for a chat, only to break it off after 20 minutes when the Italian leader rejected the German leader\u0027s overtures, according to diplomats.Before the dinner clash over migration started, Conte, head of a new government that includes the anti-establishment 5-Star movement and far-right League, refused to endorse a summit text on security and trade until other leaders had bowed to his demands to help Italy manage the Mediterranean arrivals.That forced the summit chairman Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to cancel their pre-planned news conference.It is so toxic. They go into the room, clash, storm out, go back again, clash again. With no end in sight, said one exasperated diplomat as dawn approached.It\u0027s pure politics driving this, emotions are flying as high as back in 2015, another EU diplomat said.Fewer than 45,000 migrants have made it to the European Union this year, according to United Nations data, a sharp drop from the tidal wave of 2015 when many thousands were entering on a daily basis.But the political tremors are still being felt across Europe, with populist, anti-immigrant parties on the rise in many countries.Ex-communist easterners led by Poland and Hungary are still refusing to accept a share of the new arrivals to alleviate the burden on countries like Italy and Greece.Please review our commenting policyMeet the Gambia dictator who ruled with fear, murder and voodoo...

The vote for Brexit was a cry for greater opportunity from those who feel that they and their children are mired in lives that offer little hope. \u0026nbspBrexit is a done deal, and the exact parameters of exit from the European Union will have limited and short-term bearing on the UK’s economic performance.The basic facts are uncontroversial. Britain will trade somewhat less than before, at least until British businesses redirect some of their trade away from the EU to more dynamic Asian and US economies.The expected decline in the extent of international trade will, for a while, reduce Britain’s overall economic welfare. But, as the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik has repeatedly emphasized, citizens’ economic welfare changes only modestly when countries with extensive trade relationships increase or decrease the extent of their international trade.Estimates of large (sometimes very large) costs of Brexit rely on the wildly unreasonable assumption that British productivity will decline precipitously and permanently.True, the UK\u0026nbsphas been growing slower than other advanced economies since the Brexit vote but that slower growth is almost entirely explained by senseless fiscal austerity being pursued by Prime Minister Theresa May’s government while other countries have neutral or even expansionary fiscal policy.There has been much handwringing about the depreciation of the pound triggered by the Brexit vote. Currency depreciation normally makes citizens poorer: they pay more for foreign products and receive reduced prices for their exports. But the UK was running a large (and growing) current account deficit.Put simply, the UK was not richer it was living beyond its means. Prolonged current account deficits would eventually have caused a sharper and, therefore, potentially more disruptive exchange rate depreciation. For now, the depreciation has helped narrow the deficit (precisely by making British exports less expensive for trading partners – stimulating demand for British goods – and making imports dearer for British consumers). Britain is on a more sustainable growth path.Moreover, as I noted at the time, the pound’s depreciation reflected an abrupt decline in “hot money flows” into the UK\u0026nbspThese foreign funds were being used by Russian oligarchs and Indian billionaires to bid up prices of property in London. After the Brexit decision, the rate of rise in London property price increases slowed markedly recently prices have actually dropped.Since the modest trade costs of Brexit are at least partially offset by favourable developments, it is crucial to recognise what is really at stake. The Brexit vote expressed the anxiety of those who felt that their prospects of rising up the income ladder were vanishing. In her October 2016 address to the Tory party conference in Birmingham, Theresa May seemed to understand that the vote was a plea for greater opportunity and fairness. But she seems to have lost track of that insight.As my student Rachel Lurie and I find in ongoing research, those who voted against Brexit were predominantly low-skilled workers stuck in dead-end jobs or unemployed in Britain’s rust-belt areas. As former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the days after the Brexit referendum, unable to face Asian competition, British manufacturing “collapsed,” and industrial towns “hollowed out,” leaving semi-skilled workers “on the wrong side of globalisation.”But rust-belt parents had a deeper reason to worry. They were bequeathing poor education and work opportunities to their children. Thus, not only were they themselves stuck, they also felt powerless to create more opportunities for their children and grandchildren.The children, for their part, are as dispirited as their parents. Commentators commonly point out that young British citizens voted more so than their elders to remain in the EU. This ignores the large numbers who did not vote: these were young citizens typically unemployed in socially dysfunctional urban communities.For example, in Greater London, the voter turnout was 79 percent in affluent Kingston upon Thames borough but only 65 percent in Hackney, where large pockets of deep poverty and alienation persist. The non-vote of the young living in bleak urban areas was as much a sign of hopelessness as the exit vote of older rust-belt citizens.Theresa May’s early reading was right: UK\u0026nbspcitizens were indeed pleading through their vote (and non-vote) for a fair shot at the future. They were urgently calling on British leaders to revitalize decaying industrial areas and bring hope to failing urban communities in which they were trapped.The message of the Brexit vote – and of similar protest votes in other western democracies since – was that if citizens do not feel economically secure at home, they will reject international commitments.That crucial message has been lost amid the frenzied Brexit negotiations. Until it is heard, it will continue to haunt, and be repeated again and again.Ashoka Mody\u0026nbspis Visiting Professor of International Economic Policy at Princeton University and former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund’s European and Research Departments.

According to House of Commons Library analysis, the debt is higher because the government uses the retail price index inflation measure to calculate interest on the loans, rather than the consumer price index.In April, it emerged that graduates will face a 6.3 per cent hike in the rate applied to their loan from this autumn, due to an increase in inflation. The government dropped use of the RPI measure for uprating the value of public sector pensions in 2011, leaving workers £650 a year worse off, Labour said, but continues to use the measure to drive up student debt. “The Conservatives are rigging interest rates to ramp up costs for students. It’s not enough that they’ve saddled graduates with an average of £50,000 in debt, they’re now charging an additional £16,000 on their loans,” said Peter Dowd MP, Labour’s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.“The government is cherry-picking inflation measures to maximise profits. They’ve used one measure to cut workers’ pensions and another to drive up student debt, simultaneously robbing the old and the young. They need to end this rip off and revert to the consumer price index.“The next Labour government will abolish tuition fees to ensure education is a right for all, not a privilege for a few.”UK Government to repackage student loans Budget 2017: Graduates to stop overpaying student loans Labour’s warning comes weeks after the Treasury Committee chair, Nicky Morgan, who is also a former Tory education secretary, criticised the government for its “absurd” use of the “flawed” RPI measure to calculate interest on student debt. “As RPI has been de-designated as a national statistic, the committee has urged the government to abandon its use to calculate student loan interest rates in favour of CPI,” Ms Morgan said in May. “In its response to the committee’s report, the Department for Education acknowledged the flaws of RPI, but argued that continuing its use has provided consistency over time.“Continuing to use a measure that it readily admits is flawed, on the grounds of consistency, is absurd it guarantees that student loan interest rates will be consistently flawed.”The Independent approached the government for a comment but did not get a response before publication.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Scotland suffered the worst losses, with 2.9 per cent of machines being removed.Closures accelerated as operators began to learn of Link’s plans, Which? said. The consumer group is calling on the Payment Systems Regulator to act urgently to halt the cuts until a thorough assessment of their impact can be made. It comes as local communities also rapidly lose bank branches as lenders cut costs and focus more on online banking.Link said on Friday its plans were designed to protect cash machine coverage in a declining market by increasing the fees paid to operators for transactions – known as interchange fees – in rural areas.\u0026nbspAt the same time it will increase the fees in urban areas where it says there is an oversupply of cash machines.“This will mean that whilst the overall number of machines is likely to fall in over-provided areas, the overall coverage will be protected for consumers,” Link said.

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler. What could possibly go wrong?Great music documentaries to watch nowGlastonbury is taking a fallow year but if you’re still craving your Pilton fix, look no further.

Part two takes a closer look at the Seventies - from Zandra Rhodes’ Queen costumes to the DIY punk explosion.Ian Gillan went to see the show with his girlfriend. He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors. Remarkably, that take was the one that ended up on the LP.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Immediately after his birth, doctors whisked him away to another hospital in another state – the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. His mother didn’t see him again until he was eight days old.The doctor told Kevin’s parents that the chance of him surviving was slim.\u0026nbspBut survive he did. However, the large tumour and the damage from its treatment prevented him from being able to do one of the most fundamental things humans do.\u0026nbspSmile.Most babies are born immediately able to communicate with the world around them in one way: by crying.The second signal babies send out is a smile. Newborns can smile spontaneously, as a reflex. This is sometimes misinterpreted by new parents as a reaction to their presence, a reward for their intense concern and sleepless efforts. However, it’s not until six to eight weeks of age that babies smile in a social way. Blind babies do this at the same time.That new parents sometimes optimistically interpret the first reflex smiles as meaning something more underscores the duality of smiling: there is the physical act, and then the interpretation society gives to it.\u0026nbspThe smile, and what the smile means.On a physical level, a smile is clear enough. There are 17 pairs of muscles controlling expression in the human face, plus a singular muscle, the orbicularis oris, a ring that goes entirely around the mouth.When the brain either reacts to a stimulus spontaneously or decides to form an expression intentionally, a message is sent out over the sixth and seventh cranial nerves. These branch across each side of the face from the eyebrows to the chin, connecting to a combination of muscles controlling the lips, nose, eyes and forehead.The basic upward curving smile is achieved primarily by two pairs of zygomaticus muscles, major and minor. These connect the corners of the mouth to the temples, tugging lips upward – often accompanied, depending on the underlying emotions and thoughts, by the levator labii superioris, raising the upper lip, and other muscles of the face.And as for the oft-cited folk wisdom about how it takes more muscles to frown than smile – the jury’s still out, especially as different smiles require different numbers of muscles. However, one source suggests that a genuine smile takes about as many muscles as a frown (and that a particularly insincere kind of smile might take not much more than the pair of risorius muscles).It is when we leave the realm of physiognomy, however, that the smile becomes enigmatic. This contraction of various facial muscles resonates across the entire arc of human history, from the grinning Greek kouros sculptures of 2,500 years ago right up to emoji, those little images that pepper our online communications.One study of smartphone users from 60 countries showed that emoji with smiling faces are by far the most prevalent in messages. The most popular overall – the face with tears of joy – was picked as the 2015 Word of the Year by Oxford Dictionaries. \u0026nbspJust as this emoji expresses more than mere happiness – tears adding the ironic twist so popular online – smiles themselves can convey so much more than happiness. Interpreting their nuances is a challenge whether dealing with art history or interpersonal encounters or the cutting edge of artificial intelligence.A 2016 study, published in the Journal of Nonverbal Behaviour, questioned thousands of people in 44 cultures about sets of photographs of eight faces – four smiling, four not.In most of these cultures, people deemed the smiling faces to be more honest than the non-smiling ones. This difference was huge in some countries, such as Switzerland, Australia and the Philippines, but small in others, such as Pakistan, Russia and France. And in a few countries, such as Iran, India and Zimbabwe, there was no trustworthiness benefit to smiling at all.Why? That question is also complicated, but in essence, the researchers concluded it has to do with whether a society is set up so that its members assume that other people are dealing with them honestly. “Greater corruption levels decreased trust granted towards smiling iniduals,” the authors concluded.That attitude harks back to a very old view of smiling as being opposed to pious solemnity. There is exactly one smile in the Old Testament – Job, ironically – though in many passages faces are said to “shine”, which could mean smiling or could mean heavenly radiance.Eastern religions often use the smile to denote enlightenment. The literal name of the 1000-year-old Flower Sermon, which describes the origin of Zen Buddhism, is: “Pick up flower, subtle smile.”\u0026nbspThe Buddha and various religious figures were depicted with serene smiles, though the original Buddhist texts are as devoid of smiling as Western scripture. Jesus weeps but never smiles.Nor did Kevin Portillo, not fully. He did not smile on schedule. At five weeks old, he was already a week into chemotherapy with vincristine, an anticancer drug so powerful it can cause bone pain and skin rashes. Doctors warned his mother that the treatment might leave him blind, or deaf, or unable to walk.“If he survived,” says his mother, Silvia Portillo, in Spanish, speaking through a translator. “The doctor always said he could not give us hope that he would survive.”Whether stunted due to the tumour or killed by the chemo, Kevin’s seventh cranial nerve withered. That nerve originates at the brainstem then branches out across the face. It is susceptible not only to tumours, as in Kevin’s case, but also to rare conditions such as Moebius syndrome, a congenital facial paralysis caused by missing or stunted cranial nerves. You can’t smile, frown, or move your eyes from side to side.“You essentially have a mask on your face,” says Roland Bienvenu, 67, a Texan with Moebius syndrome.Without being able to smile, others “can get the incorrect impression of you,” says Bienvenu. “You can almost read their thoughts. They wonder, ‘Is something wrong with him? Has he had an accident?’ They question your intellectual ability, think maybe he’s got some intellectual disability since he’s got this blank look on his face.”A lopsided smile can be as problematic as no smile at all.“I have half a smile, so even with that I am able to successfully convey emotion,” writes Dawn Shawn, born with a teratoma – a fast-growing tumour that was interfering with her windpipe.“The hardest part for me was seeing photos of myself smiling, because smiling exaggerates the fact that half my face doesn’t move very much. But eventually I learned to own it. That is me. That is how I look.”The challenges stemming from lack of a smile are frequently compounded. When people have a medical condition severe enough to keep them from smiling, other difficulties tend to be involved.“He was different than the other kids,” says Silvia of her son. “He was fed for four years through the G-tube in his stomach. He wasn’t able to have a normal life, because every few hours he had to be connected to the machine to be fed.” Little kids, being curious, would look and ask what happened to him, she says.While those who cannot smile can blame the state of their facial nerves and muscles, those who can smile are often concerned with a different aspect of physiognomy: their teeth. More than $3bn is spent worldwide on teeth-whitening products, with billions more spent on braces and on purely cosmetic dentistry: straightening crooked teeth, for instance, or reducing the amount of gum that shows when a person smiles.Caring for the state of your teeth is not a modern concern. The Romans had dentists and used chewing sticks and toothpaste. They preferred dazzling white smiles, sometimes rinsing their teeth in urine to enhance the effect.Contrary to common modern perceptions, the ancients had surprisingly good teeth, for reasons that have nothing to do with dentistry. A CAT scan of 30 adult bodies recovered at Pompeii found they had “perfect teeth”.Health news in pictures150 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active350 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.450 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.550 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.2650 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.2750 Ketamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors sayKetamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors say2850 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed2950 Measles outbreak spreads across Europe as parents shun vaccinations, WHO warnsMajor measles outbreaks are spreading across Europe despite the availability of a safe, effective vaccine, the World Health Organisation has warned.3050 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3150 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3250 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3350 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3450 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesScientists have made a “monumental leap forward” in the treatment of pancreatic cancer after discovering using two drugs together dramatically improved patients’ chances of living more than five years after diagnosis.3650 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.3750 Over-cooked potatoes and burnt toast ‘could cause cancer’The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a public warning over the risks of acrylamide - a chemical compound that forms in some foods when they are cooked at high temperatures (above 120C).3850 Cervical cancer screening attendance hits 19 year lowCervical screening tests are a vital method of preventing cancer through the detection and treatment of abnormalities in the cervix, but new research shows that the number of women using this service has dropped to a 19 year low.3950 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaThe ConversationIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4050 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide4150 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4250 Green tea could be used to treat brain issues caused by Down’s SyndromeA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”4350 Taking antidepressants in pregnancy ‘could double the risk of autism in toddlers’Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened4550 Connections between brain cells destroyed in early stages of Alzheimer’s diseaseScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memories4650 A prosthetic hand that lets people actually feel throughThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way4750 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4850 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 4950 NHS agree, after loosing legal battle, to fund HIV prevention drugHaving lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.150 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active350 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.450 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.550 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms. Melissa Whiteley, an 18-year-old engineering student from Hanford in Stoke-on-Trent, fell ill at Christmas and died in hospital a month later.650 Government to review thousands of harmful vaginal mesh implantsThe Government has pledged to review tens of thousands of cases where women have been given harmful vaginal mesh implants.750 Jeremy Hunt announces \u0027zero suicides ambition\u0027 for the NHSThe NHS will be asked to go further to prevent the deaths of patients in its care as part of a “zero suicide ambition” being launched today.850 Human trials start with cancer treatment that primes immune system to kill off tumoursHuman trials have begun with a new cancer therapy that can prime the immune system to eradicate tumours. The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. 950 NHS reviewing thousands of cervical cancer smear tests after women wrongly given all-clearThousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.1050 Potential key to halting breast cancer\u0027s spread discovered by scientistsMost breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.1150 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data. Demand for nurses was 19 per cent higher between July and September 2017 than the same period two years ago.1250 Malnutrition deaths in hospitals in England and Wales at highest level for a decadeThe number of people dying in hospital as a result of malnutrition has hit its highest level for a decade, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show. Death certificates from England and Wales show that malnutrition was listed as the primary cause in a total of 66 deaths in 2016.1350 Fertility \u0027breakthrough\u0027 as human eggs grown in lab for first timeHuman eggs with the potential to become fertilised embryos have been grown in a laboratory for the first time in a breakthrough that could unlock future fertility treatments. 1450 Cannabis extract could provide ‘new class of treatment’ for psychosisCBD has a broadly opposite effect to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active component  in cannabis and the substance that causes paranoia and anxiety.1550 Babies\u0027 health suffers from being born near fracking sites, finds major studyMothers living within a kilometre of a fracking site were 25 per cent more likely to have a child born at low birth weight, which increase their chances of asthma, ADHD and other issues1650 Over 75,000 sign petition calling for Richard Branson\u0027s Virgin Care to hand settlement money back to NHSMr Branson’s company sued the NHS last year after it lost out on an £82m contract to provide children’s health services across Surrey, citing concerns over “serious flaws” in the way the contract was awarded1750 More than 700 fewer nurses training in England in first year after NHS bursary scrappedThe numbers of people accepted to study nursing in England fell 3 per cent in 2017, while the numbers accepted in Wales and Scotland, where the bursaries were kept, increased 8.4 per cent and 8 per cent respectively1850 Landmark study links Tory austerity to 120,000 deathsThe paper found that there were 45,000 more deaths in the first four years of Tory-led efficiencies than would have been expected if funding had stayed at pre-election levels.Hours of commuting may be mind-numbingly dull, but new research shows that it might also be having an adverse effect on both your health and performance at work.  Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2050 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued.

Prior to the French Revolution, broad smiles in art were overwhelmingly the realm of the lewd, the drunk and the boisterous lower classes.“The whole face ought to reflect an air of seriousness and wisdom,” John Baptist de La Salle wrote in his 1703 The Rules of Christian Decorum and Civility, allowing that people might, under certain circumstances, convey the impression that they are happy, provided it is done within limits.“There are some people who raise their upper lip so high or let the lower lip sag so much that their teeth are almost entirely visible. This is entirely contrary to decorum, which forbids you to allow your teeth to be uncovered, for nature gave us lips to conceal them…”In The Smile Revolution in Eighteenth Century Paris, Colin Jones argues that smiling reflected the gathering sense of inidual worth that went along with the beheading of kings:This shift in social practices and in sensibilities involved the emergence of the perception, common in our own day, that the smile offered a key to inidual identity. In late eighteenth-century Paris, the smile came to be viewed as symbol of an inidual’s innermost and most authentic self. In a way that was perceived as both novel and modern, it was held to reveal the character of the person within.Photography, by capturing smiles, eventually helped popularise them. But the sitters in 19th-century photographs still rarely smiled, a neutral continence being both easier to hold over the long exposure necessary at the time and less likely to detract from the gravity of the occasion.“A photograph is a most important document, and there is nothing more damning to go down to posterity than a silly, foolish smile caught and fixed forever,” humorist Mark Twain was quoted as remarking in the 1913 memoir of an acquaintance.Around the same time, however, Kodak in the US launched extensive advertising campaigns to help consumers see photography as a means of recording joyous events and celebrations.Over the century, smiles showed a confidence in keeping with the rise of modern capitalism. “An insincere grin? That doesn’t fool anybody,” Dale Carnegie wrote in his 1936 bestseller, How to Win Friends and Influence People, embraced as a life guide by millions.“We know it is mechanical and we resent it. I am talking about a real smile, a heartwarming smile, a smile that comes from within, the kind of smile that will bring a good price in the marketplace.”Part of the attractiveness of smiles is they are so easily extended. Part of their menace is that they can also be just as easily withheld.“For a salesman, there’s no rock bottom to the life,” Charlie says at the end of Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman. “He don’t put a bolt to a nut, he don’t tell you the law or give you medicine. He’s a man way out there in the blue, riding on a smile and a shoeshine. And when they start not smiling back – that’s an earthquake.”Once Kevin was able to eat food, go to school and enjoy usual childhood pastimes – he became passionate about soccer and playing the drums – he still felt the tremors of having a half-smile in a world solidly established upon “a cultural expectation of pearly perfection”, as Richard Barnett writes in his book The Smile Stealers.“I couldn’t smile on my left, I only smiled on my right,” says Kevin. “My smile was weird … people kept asking what happened to me, why I\u0027m like this. I keep telling them I was like this when I was born.”If you see someone in a wheelchair, you anticipate that the person might have trouble walking and assume a physical condition is involved. But facial paralysis carries no telltale equipment, and is rare enough that the unaffected population is not generally familiar with the conditions that cause it, whether congenital or appearing later in life.One of the latter is Bell’s palsy, an inflammation of the sheathing around the facial nerves on one side that paralyses half the face, causing the eye and corner of the mouth to droop. It usually strikes men and women between the ages of 15 and 60.In most cases temporary, Bell’s palsy generally slowly goes away as mysteriously as it arrives. Doctors suspect it is caused by a viral infection. There are also traumatic events – car wrecks, sporting accidents – that damage nerves and muscles in the face, plus congenital irregularities such as cleft palate.A common condition that can also affect the smile is stroke. A sagging smile or face drooped on one side is one of three signs that a person has had a stroke and needs immediate emergency care (the other two are weakness or numbness in one arm, and slurred or garbled speech).While losing a smile is a serious blow at any age, it can have a particular impact on younger people, who are starting out, forming the bonds that will carry them through the rest of their lives.\u0026nbspOr trying to.“It’s a huge problem,” says Tami Konieczny, supervisor of occupational therapy at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHoP). “When you look at somebody, the first thing you see is their face, their ability to smile or not smile, or an asymmetrical smile. It’s your social world.“If someone can’t read your facial expressions, then it’s difficult to be socially accepted. It’s hugely devastating for kids. I had kids photoshopping their pictures. They are taking mirror images of their good side and copying it, photoshopping their own pictures before posting them to social media.”Photoshopping might work on Facebook. But fixing a smile bisected by nerve damage and subsequent muscle loss – Kevin couldn’t move the muscles on the left side of his face, so they atrophied – is far more complicated. Sometimes, it requires multi-stage plastic surgery spread out over a year or more.There are two major procedures available for facial reanimation, according to Phuong Nguyen, a plastic surgeon and reconstructive surgeon at CHoP.The newest, which has its roots in older techniques, is called a lengthening temporalis myoplasty – taking part of the broad band of muscle that powers the jaws and repurposing it to draw up the lips.That wasn’t ideal for Kevin because he had one side of his face working. The older, more complicated surgery was better suited to him.“Kevin had the most commonly done one, a classic two-stage cross-face nerve graft followed by a free gracilis muscle transfer,” says Nguyen. “To be perfectly honest, when Kevin had his stage, we weren’t familiar with the lengthening temporalis myoplasty procedure yet.”Nguyen later learned the new procedure from facial reanimation pioneer Ronald Zuker, a Canadian plastic and reconstructive surgeon, and from its originator, French surgeon Daniel Labbé.“My preference is to do it when kids are five years of age,” says Zuker. “At the time, if I can restore a smile for them, they can go to primary school, meet kids on the playground, meet kids in class. They have their smiles and are well-equipped to handle that situation.”Why put children through what is still elective surgery?“It’s incredibly important to be able to interact with humans on a face-to-face basis,” says Zuker. “If you don’t have the ability to smile, you are at a disadvantage. People cannot understand your inner emotions. They mistake your appearance for being disinterested, or not too bright, or not very involved in the conversation.”Still, some parents prefer to wait until their children are older and can participate in the decision.“If families want to wait, that’s perfectly fine,” says Zuker. “Sometimes when a kid is nine or 10 they look in the mirror and say, ‘You know, I really want this surgery.’ That’s the time to do it.”Which is what happened with Kevin. He was doing well, “even with that scar on his face, has always been popular at school,” says his mother. “He’s always been a happy kid.”But there were kids that made fun of him, she says. One day when he was about nine, he was sad. “I said, ‘What happened to you?’ He said, ‘Some kids, they’re not my friends. They laugh at me because I look funny.’ It was really hard for us as parents.”“We always wanted the surgery,” she says. “But we were told it was impossible. We had to wait to see how everything was changing.”At age 10, Kevin told his parents that he wanted to do what most people do without giving it a second thought. He knew it would be a long, painful, difficult procedure, but it was one he wanted to undergo.“He’s very engaging, very motivated,” says Anne-Ashley Field, his occupational therapist at CHoP. “His goal, I wrote in my notes, was to have a symmetrical smile.”As with smiles themselves, so the scientific study of smiles reflects the cleavage between the physical and the interpretive. The physical side is entwined with the long history of plastic surgery, which has tended to focus on survivors of diseases like syphilis and of the knives of vengeful authorities and warlords.The father of modern plastic surgery, Harold Gillies, reported in 1934 that restoring the ability to smile made patients’ faces “feel much more comfortable”. In addition, Gillies observed, “the psychological effect is also one of considerable value”.On the interpretive side, Charles Darwin discusses the meaning and value of smiles in his 1872 landmark The Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals. Like many, Darwin sees a smile as the first part of a continuum.“A smile, therefore, may be said to be the first stage in the development of a laugh,” \u0026nbsphe writes, then reverses course, musing that perhaps the smile is instead the remnant of laughter.He observes his own infants closely, detecting in two their first smiles at six weeks, and earlier in the third. He comments how smiles do more than merely convey happiness, mentioning the “derisive or sardonic smile” and the “unnatural or false smile”, and showing photos to see if his associates can read what they mean.The scientific study of smiles finds differences in gender (generally, women smile more) and culture. Smiles are definitely communicative – people smile more when in public than they do when alone, and more when interacting with others than when not.Scientists have shown that smiles are far easier to recognise than other expressions. What they don’t know is why.“We can do really well recognising smiles,” says Aleix Martinez, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Ohio State University and founder of its Computational Biology and Cognitive Science Lab.“Why is that true? Nobody can answer that right now. We don’t know. We really do not know. We have a classical experiment, where we showed images of facial expressions to people, but we showed them very rapidly… 10 milliseconds, 20 milliseconds.“People can detect a smile even in exposures smaller than 10 milliseconds. I can show you an image for just 10 milliseconds and you can tell me it’s a smile. It does not work with any other expression.”Fear takes an exposure time of 250 milliseconds to recognise – 25 times as long as a smile, “which makes absolutely no sense, evolutionarily speaking,” Martinez says. “Recognising fear is fundamental to survival, while a smile… But that’s how we are wired.”Studies have shown that smiling faces are judged as more familiar than neutral ones. And it’s not just us that can recognise smiles more easily. “This is true both for humans and for machines,” says Martinez. Alibaba, China’s answer to Amazon, launched its new facial recognition payment system called “Smile to Pay” in September 2017.Although scientists have been studying smiles for about 150 years, they are still at the stage of trying to count and categorise types of smile among the millions of possible facial expressions.“One of the fundamental questions in the scientific literature right now is how many facial expressions do we actually produce?” says Martinez. “Nobody knows.”Scientists such as Martinez theorise that smiles – as well as frowns and other facial expressions – are remnants of humanity’s distant pre-linguistic heritage. Human language started developing as far back as 100,000 years ago, but our expressions reach back further still, even to before our origins as human beings.“Before we could communicate verbally, we had to communicate with our faces,” Martinez says. “Which brings us to a very interesting, very fundamental question in science: where does language come from? Language is not fossilised, not found in any other living species. How could something that complex have evolved from nothingness?”One of the hypotheses is that it evolved through facial expression of emotion, he says. “First we learned to move our facial muscles – ‘I’m happy. I feel positive with you! I’m angry. I feel disgust.’ Then language came through a grammaticalisation of facial expressions, which over time evolved into what we call grammar and language.”In October 2015, Nguyen, who plays in a band, cranked up some rock music in the operating room at CHoP – he thinks it was probably something from the Smashing Pumpkins album Siamese Dream.He began work by removing a section of sural nerve from Kevin’s right ankle and attaching it to the working right side of his face, running it underneath his upper lip, to the paralysed left.“We bring it across, parking it, waiting for nerves to regrow from the right side to the left,” Nguyen says.That growth took almost a year. The nerve fibres advanced about a millimetre a day (about 24,000 times slower than a snail).In nerve grafts like this, many of the fibres don’t make it across. This means that the nerve can lose the ability to transmit information – in a few cases, completely.“The thing with nerve-based surgery, you don’t get a lot of instant gratification or feedback,” says Nguyen. “You do the procedure and don’t know if it works or not. You have to wait.”During that time, doctors would periodically tap areas of Kevin’s cheek, to see if the nerve was taking. “When it tingles, you know the nerve is growing,” says Nguyen.The body has a way of covering losses. Removing that nerve did cause a small patch of skin on Kevin’s ankle to go numb. But as he was still growing, the numb patch began to shrink as the neural network took over its function.Once Nguyen was certain the nerve was in place and functioning, it was time for the second stage of the surgery.The mystery of Mona Lisa\u0027s smile has finally been solved Mona Lisa smile \u0027based on his gay lover\u0027, art historian claimsRussian Mona Lisa could be genuineSecrets of the Mona Lisa, BBC2, TV review: the face behind the paintOne morning in August 2016, he took a purple marker and wrote a “P” on Kevin’s left temple and an “NP” on his right, for “paralysed” and “not paralysed”, a common surgical precaution against the risk of cutting into the wrong side of a patient – easier than you might imagine, considering how much of a patient’s body is draped before surgery.“It happens,” says Nguyen. “You want to make it idiot-proof.” \u0026nbspHe also drew a pair of parallel lines, marking the location of a prime artery, and an arrow: the vector Kevin’s smile would take.The surgeon made an incision from the temporal hair line, in front of Kevin’s left ear, then pivoting back under and behind it, extending into his neck – the standard location for hiding plastic surgery scars. The skin on a face peels back easily. He attached three sutures to the inside corner of Kevin’s mouth and gently pulled, to gauge exactly where the muscle should be attached.“So you know it’s in the right place,” explains Nguyen. “If you don’t get this right, they’re going to have to live with it for the rest of their life.”The moment Nguyen put strain on the triple surgical thread was the first time Kevin Portillo ever smiled on the left side of his face.That done, Nguyen removed a 12-centimetre segment of gracilis muscle, along with a section of artery and vein, from the inside of Kevin’s left thigh, as well as the obturator nerve. The muscle was secured in place by a customised splint that hooked into Kevin’s mouth and was sewn to the side of his head to keep the relocated muscle from pulling out before it healed.The section was taken from Kevin’s thigh because the powerful upper leg is rich in muscles. “There are so many muscles that do the same function… you don’t miss this,” Nguyen says.Well… most wouldn’t miss it. Kevin, a diehard young soccer fan, did. “When the surgery came I couldn’t play,” he says. “I didn’t know it would take that long. I thought it would take a couple days and I would be back.”Just how long was he sidelined?“It was more than two weeks,” he says, sorrowfully.“He wasn’t concerned with how serious the surgery was,” his mother says, laughing. “He was more concerned with not being able to play soccer.”Over the next year, Kevin began to get motion on the left side of his mouth.“It’s really kind of a magical thing,” says Nguyen. “We do this procedure, a number of hours and effort, using not a small amount of resources. We don’t know if it works or not.“I saw him post-operatively within the first couple of weeks, he looked like he had this big bulgy thing in his cheek. Nothing was moving. All of a sudden, he was smiling. It was a really incredible moment.”Well, it’s magical, but it’s also hard work. Low-tech and high-tech.\u0026nbspKevin begins his regular occupational therapy session by holding a two-cent white plastic fork in his mouth and showing that he can move it up and down.“Try to purse your lips together to make it stand up,” says Anne-Ashley Field, his therapist at CHoP. “We’ve got it pretty solid in the middle. Try to work it over to the weaker side. Nice try… and that’s harder.”Kevin puts on purple latex gloves and pulls at the inside of his cheek.“You’re going to do your stretch on the inside,” says Field. “A nice, slow hold. Good. Bring that thumb up… Do you feel like it’s getting looser than it was?”“Mmm-hmmm,” Kevin agrees, gloved fingers in mouth.She takes some photos. There is a lot of photography in facial therapy, to track progress.“Now give me the biggest open-mouthed smile you can,” says Field. “Good. Can you make the left side go up even more? Try to make your gums even.”Then, after more exercises, she asks if he is ready for the computer work.They move into the next room, to a $20,000 Lenovo biometric therapy system. Field sticks a surface EMG – an oblong black sensor that reads electrical activity in the muscle – to Kevin’s left cheek and he plays a video game, Load Ship, where he moves animated boxes from a conveyor on the screen by smiling and relaxing.“Give me a big smile,” Field says, calibrating the device. “And relax.”He plays for four minutes, the game burbling a skittery kind of jazzy electronic music.They play a few other games: one trying to get a man to a safe spot as two serrated blue spaces come together. Then a marble maze.“How are you feeling?” she asks.“Hurts,” he replies.Physical rehabilitation is the part of the surgical process that often gets overlooked, but it can make the difference between success and failure.“It’s huge, particularly with facial palsy,” says Nguyen. “You can do technically very sound surgery on two completely different patients and have two completely different outcomes based on how involved they are with their own therapy… It just doesn’t look as good.”How does Kevin feel about being able to fully smile after a lifetime of not being able to?“I’ve been getting better on how I react. I do it automatically,” says Kevin. “Sometimes when somebody says a joke. It actually feels great now. Before it felt weird to not smile. Smiling with both sides of my mouth at same time, I feel I’m one of the other people who smiles right.”His mother remembers the moment she noticed.“We were at the table, we were eating,” says Silvia. “And then we said, ‘Kevin, are you moving there?’ He started moving. Not the way he was doing today little movements.”“We were eating,” he says. “I think she said something funny, and I just smiled.”And how does smiling affect his life?“Before, I was actually shy,” he says. “Right now, I’m less shy, more active.”“I used to have trouble expressing my emotions. Now people know if I’m smiling or laughing. When I laughed, before, I laughed weird. And right now, they know, bit by bit, that I was trying to smile, I was expressing my laughter and my smile. When I play soccer, and score a goal, I’m happy. I’m smiling, to tell everybody I scored.”You’d be forgiven for thinking that classifying and counting the different types of smile would be straightforward. It’s anything but.In the mid 19th century, French neurologist Guillaume Duchenne wanted to distinguish real smiles from fake. Interested in the response of nerves and muscles to stimulation, he applied electricity to particular parts of faces to see the results.He ided smiles into two groups: those that involved the crinkling of the eyes – sincere smiles – and those that used only the muscles around the mouth – insincere smiles.Today, the full smile that uses the muscles around the mouth and eyes is known as a “Duchenne smile” – and the fake one is the “Pan Am smile”, after the kind of smile you might greet someone with if it’s part of your job to be friendly.In 1974, Leonard Rubin described three basic types of smile, based on his study of 100 people:The “Mona Lisa”, where the corners of the mouth go up and outwards and the upper teeth are exposed. The dominant muscle action is from the zygomaticus major. About two-thirds of people studied smile this wayThe “canine” smile, where the canine teeth are exposed. The dominant muscle action is from the levator labii superioris. 31 per cent of people smiled like thisThe “full dentured”, where the lips are pulled back strongly, showing both upper and lower rows of teeth. All muscles are equally dominant. Just 2 per cent of people were found to smile this wayCosmetic surgeons, who have to be meticulous in identifying the smiles that their patients are paying good money to try to achieve, call these three types commissure, cuspid and complex, respectively.Phuong Nguyen, a Philadelphia plastic and reconstructive surgeon, attempts to clarify the matter using celebrities. The Mona Lisa, he says, is the Angelina Jolie. The Tom Cruise smile is a canine smile, and a Julia Roberts is the full dentured smile. This is a subjective matter. Other doctors place Jolie in the second or third categories.Smiling is not a realm given over to easy description. Contemplate the ideal smile as recounted by one clinician in the Journal of Clinical Orthodontics:An optimal smile is characterised by an upper lip that reaches the gingival margins, with an upward or straight curvature between the philtrum and commissures an upper incisal line coincident with the border of the lower lip minimal or no lateral negative space a commissural line and occlusal frontal plane parallel to the pupillary line and harmoniously integrated dental and gingival components.The total number of different types of smile is frequently debated. A recent BBC article gave the total as 19.Arguably the most important researcher into smiles over the past 30 years has been Paul Ekman at the University of California. His 1978 Facial Action Coding System, written with Wallace V Friesen, seeks to create an atlas of nearly all possible human expressions. Ekman says, in his book Telling Lies, that their technique for measuring the face can distinguish over 50 different smiles.Confused? You’re not the only one.

But can he be converted?\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent OnlineI’ll give her this: she is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in rapturesThree hours of Public Enemy: that’s what I got when I let my son have his choice of music in the car recently. Amid his vast collection of Pokemon trading cards is a set featuring the members of Queens of the Stone Age. And one of my favourite moments as a dad was his overjoyed reaction when I told him I’d got us tickets for Metallica. He’s a music-loving father’s dream.\u0026nbspBut what’s good for the goose has to be good for the gander. Or the other way around. So when Taylor Swift announced that her reputation stadium tour was coming to Wembley, it was a case of fair’s fair. It was my daughter’s turn, even if it meant this Metallica Dad agreeing to a descent into musical purgatory on a Friday night instead of catching up with Game of Thrones.\u0026nbsp“On no, you’ll love it, you’ll have such a good time. I’m so jealous!”That was the response of a shockingly large number of female friends and acquaintances, many of whom volunteered to accompany my seven-year-old daughter Rheya\u0026nbspwhen I expressed trepidation at the prospect of an evening in the company of 100,000 screaming Swifties.\u0026nbspThe ersity of those it came from took me aback: people I just couldn’t imagine would be fans were saying it.\u0026nbspThere were culture vultures and rock fans. Twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, and forty-somethings. Some with no children, others with a hatful, whose daughters, like mine, they were taking. I sometimes found myself saying, “what, you too?”Taylor Swift seems to hold a good chunk of the female population in her thrall. And not a few men too. Quite an achievement for a onetime country singer.\u0026nbspIt seems to be Swift’s particular way with words that has drawn them in. Nashville is renowned for its story tellers. But Swift’s stories have resonated with a far wider constituency than is usual for singers coming from out of that milieu. \u0026nbspRheyaAt her Wembley show, she likened what she does to the opening up her diary. The chronicling of the ups and downs of her love life, her biting back at bad boyfriends, her reflection on experiences many of those who count themselves her fans will have had, speaks to them.\u0026nbspSelina Mills, a writer friend of mine, and one of those who had me saying “what you too?”, says she serves up “emotional truths” with that diary.\u0026nbspAnother friend, Karen Attwood, who runs Nine Media Training, says: “She’s as good with an acoustic guitar as she is with a big pop anthem and I just love her lyrics. She is having a conversation they’re gorgeous, often very funny and sarcastic.”\u0026nbspIt never hurts if you can make ’em smile. Swift does it for her fans in the same way that a cutting rhyme from rapper Chuck D does it for me. Hey, whatever floats your boat.\u0026nbspFrom beef to BFFs to beef again: Kanye West and Taylor SwiftNEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 13:   Kanye West (L) jumps onstage after Taylor Swift (C) won the Best Female Video award during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall on September 13, 2009 in New York City.

Right now, it’s them against us. This shit is ugly to the core. When it comes to the poor, no lives matter!” Now that’s the sort of the conversation I want to have.\u0026nbspFeeling suitably purged and, yes, a little self-righteous, I felt able to spend an afternoon in the company of Taylor. But after the first half hour I almost felt like saying “look what you made me do”\u0026nbspto Rheya. And my editors, because I didn’t find listening to her latest missive any easier than her fans might find sampling Slayer.\u0026nbspIt’s not that I can’t recognise a good pop song. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. But reputation’s hooks seemed swamped in a sea of expensive production. Here a backing singer trills, there a rapper rhymes, as the vocals tail off into electronic distortion. Meanwhile\u0026nbspSwift reflects on the trials and tribulations not so much of being a teenager, but of being an uber-famous member of the 1 per cent, a bona fide mega star, with the requisite stable of hip hop style feuds.\u0026nbsp1989, her first “official”\u0026nbsppop record, I found more approachable, and memorable. I confess, I already had some familiarity with that album on account of indie troubadour Ryan Adams covering the whole thing. He somehow managed to put a wistful and melancholy sheen on an upbeat and feisty pop record, widely recognised as the highpoint of her career to date. Moving further back, Nashville becomes progressively more noticeable, and Swift’s stories more innocent and easier to hear.\u0026nbspBut what about the show designed to showcase it all? If not the hottest ticket in town, it was certainly the priciest, part of an effort, it has been argued, to neutralise the scalpers who would have profited handsomely through gouging fans had Swift left money on the table.\u0026nbspI have to admit: a part of me was intrigued. I’ve been going to gigs for more than 30 years now (it makes me shudder to have to say that) and I’ve seen almost everything. Metal, indie, jazz, rap, soul, punk and more besides. I’ve been to decaying fleapit clubs, massive arenas, festivals and, yes, even great big stadia.\u0026nbspBut what I’d never experienced before my evening with Swift was one those bona fide pop mega tours the sort of thing featuring a cast of thousands, that takes several planes, and a fleet of trucks to move the thing from to venue to venue, and turns over the GDP of a small country.It was a world apart from the stadium shows I’ve previously been to. The Stone Roses, for example, needed only their songs, together with the odd inflatable ball bouncing up and down in the crowd, to make for a thoroughly memorable occasion last summer, one worth the price of tickets that weren’t exactly cheap themselves.\u0026nbspA Swift show, by contrast, majors as much on spectacle as it does on music. There were, at Wembley, enough huge snakes to send an ophidiophobic fan running for a\u0026nbsptherapist. Apparently their presence stems from an insult the Kardashian married to Kanye West lobbed at her, and they’ve since become something of a trademark. One’s probably pending.\u0026nbspThere was fire, and fireworks, and films. There was the obligatory army of dancers. Everyone was given a light bracelet on their way in, which seemed to change colours at the command of someone armed with an iPad backstage. The effect was actually rather pretty, if not exactly environmentally friendly.\u0026nbspThere was even a sort of floating cage of lights to ferry Swift between the three (count ’em) stages and, at the end, a bloke whom I’m reliably informed was once in One Direction, came on to perform a duet. Neither me nor my daughter were quite sure who he was, although his presence seemed to delight the crowd. \u0026nbspAs for Swift herself? Well, I’ll give her this. She is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in raptures.\u0026nbsp“Thank you for joining us on the reputation stadium tour,” she said. It was a line she repeated several times. I could almost hear the business manager whispering in her ear: “Don’t say anything that could be considered controversial, but make sure you reference the brand at least once every 15 minutes or so. It’s good for T-shirt sales.”In the middle of this assault on the senses I was again left wondering whether Swift isn’t in danger of losing that connection she has forged. But then, about halfway through, with her occupying stage number two, she produced an acoustic guitar and just sang. She did the same with a piano later on. It worked too. Whatever Swift is, she is no manufactured talent, incapable of surviving without studio trickery, and solely reliant on others to play the instruments. It made me wonder if all the extra stuff was really necessary.\u0026nbspThe reputation\u0026nbspalbum may not have done the business 1989 did, and Swift may have strained her connection with some, but her still loyal fans lapped up everything she did.\u0026nbspCrucially, so did my daughter. All my criticisms started to pale before her sheer unabashed joy. It would have made any parent melt, and the zone of protection I thought I’d established by wearing my Metallica tour T-shirt, with a suitably gruesome design, was breached. In a world that seems to grow grimmer by the day, I couldn’t help but be uplifted at my child’s innocent delight. I even found myself enjoying myself, if vicariously.\u0026nbspAttwood says part of Swift’s appeal, as a parent, is that “among all the hyper sexualised pop stars she is a fantastic role model for my daughter”.\u0026nbspTaylor Swift brings Robbie Williams on stage to sing ‘Angels’ Taylor Swift launches UK ‘reputation’ tour in ManchesterTaylor Swift marks Pride Month with heartfelt speech in ChicagoIs Taylor Swift off-loading her Beverly Hills property portfolio?And I get that. Even though with all that branding it sometimes seems as if she’s as much CEO as she is musician, she is, to quote Janet Jackson, in control.I don’t think Taylor will be troubling my speakers in future, but this Metallica Dad was able to make an accommodation with her.There is a postscript that may amuse you. Since getting one of those Amazon Echo Dots, my chip-off-the-old-block son has been constantly playing what he tells me are Geometry Dash composers. They play electronic video game music that leaves me cold.My daughter, meanwhile, has developed an obsession with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, to the extent that sometimes she’s even had me saying “can’t we have something else on?”.\u0026nbspIt means I might have to enjoy our next live experience vicariously. Next time they tour she’s made it clear she doesn’t want to be left out.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Having a friendship with a girl in the villa is just as important as finding romance.Coming from Newcastle, the personal trainer and gym director says: “I would say I’m a ten out of ten. Maybe a nine out of ten... I’m not good at washing the dishes.”A West End performer from London, Samira says: I’m looking for an experience that I’ve never had before, loads of fun, the opportunity to meet a really nice guy, or even a best friend, and the chance to find myself.A model from Liverpool, Harley says: “My nickname from my friends is a, maybe because I always go after what I want and I always get it.From Staffordshire, the Nuclear Systems Design Engineer says: “I’m looking for a partner, I’m looking for someone I can settle down with and tame my wild lifestyle.”The retail manager and part-time model from Blackpool says: “I don’t do my nails, or have hair or lash extensions. Everything on me is real I am who I am.”An A\u0026ampE Doctor who has already angered the Daily Mail by taking time off his job to appear on the ITV show, Alex comes from Carmarthen, West Wales. He says: I don’t like high maintenance girls. I think it’s brilliant to look good but spending three hours to get ready to go and walk on the beach is too much for me.Another model, this one from London. I have a fun energy and I am a spiritual person, he says. I’d like to think I have a depth to me so I guess that stands out and I look at things quite deeply.The oldest person to join this year\u0027s competition, Laura is a air hostess from Stirling, Scotland. “The emoji that best describes me is probably the blonde girl, she says, because I’m just a weirdo cause I’m always just like, \u0027Hey, soz about me.\u0027A student and construction worker who has a Hermione Granger\u0027s wand tattoo on his arm.

This led to a reclassification of it as an asteroid.”While asteroids are made up of rock and metals, comets form from ice, dust and rocky fragments and move through space in a different way.Oumuamua lacked the tail that forms as comets melt and release gases and dust, meaning it was difficult to determine what exactly it was.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

According to House of Commons Library analysis, the debt is higher because the government uses the retail price index inflation measure to calculate interest on the loans, rather than the consumer price index.In April, it emerged that graduates will face a 6.3 per cent hike in the rate applied to their loan from this autumn, due to an increase in inflation. The government dropped use of the RPI measure for uprating the value of public sector pensions in 2011, leaving workers £650 a year worse off, Labour said, but continues to use the measure to drive up student debt. “The Conservatives are rigging interest rates to ramp up costs for students. It’s not enough that they’ve saddled graduates with an average of £50,000 in debt, they’re now charging an additional £16,000 on their loans,” said Peter Dowd MP, Labour’s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.“The government is cherry-picking inflation measures to maximise profits. They’ve used one measure to cut workers’ pensions and another to drive up student debt, simultaneously robbing the old and the young. They need to end this rip off and revert to the consumer price index.“The next Labour government will abolish tuition fees to ensure education is a right for all, not a privilege for a few.”UK Government to repackage student loans Budget 2017: Graduates to stop overpaying student loans Labour’s warning comes weeks after the Treasury Committee chair, Nicky Morgan, who is also a former Tory education secretary, criticised the government for its “absurd” use of the “flawed” RPI measure to calculate interest on student debt. “As RPI has been de-designated as a national statistic, the committee has urged the government to abandon its use to calculate student loan interest rates in favour of CPI,” Ms Morgan said in May. “In its response to the committee’s report, the Department for Education acknowledged the flaws of RPI, but argued that continuing its use has provided consistency over time.“Continuing to use a measure that it readily admits is flawed, on the grounds of consistency, is absurd it guarantees that student loan interest rates will be consistently flawed.”The Independent approached the government for a comment but did not get a response before publication.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But the significant number of EU migrants leaving is a reminder that the UK must remain an attractive place to work,” a CBI spokesperson said.“It is also time to confirm that this offer to EU citizens is independent of wider negotiations and that it will not be taken off the table altogether in the event of ‘no deal’.”Leaders in the health and social care sector have also mounted concerns about its capacity to recruit and retain care staff from other EU countries after Brexit, warning that without the “major contribution” made by foreign workers, more elderly and disabled people will be driven into institutional care settings and away from independent living.Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, told The Independent: “Social care is a fundamental public service on which millions of older people and disabled adults depend to live their lives. It is above all a ‘people business’, but it is proving difficult to attract enough high quality staff who want to engage in this demanding, albeit rewarding, work.\u0026nbsp“Every day there are an estimated 90,000 vacancies in the social care workforce, and in some parts of the country especially a major contribution is made by care staff who have come here from abroad, both from within the EU and also far beyond it.“Philip Connolly, policy manager at Disability Rights UK, echoed her concerns, saying: “These sectors are largely made up of people from overseas, but more and more of these people have been deterred from coming following the Brexit referendum.”Ms Abbott said many EU citizens are\u0026nbspworried about their future status.“Ministers have talked as if they are a bargaining chip and the government’s latest effort falls well short of providing certainty,” she added.\u0026nbsp“The government’s policy of creating a hostile environment affects all migrants, including those perfectly entitled to be here. It is wrong, and it is damaging our society and our prosperity. It should be abandoned.”Chai Patel, policy director at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), claimed the UK was becoming a “less welcoming” place for migrants, and warned that this would be a “very serious” problem for public services and Britain’s economic future.“Immigrants pay more into public services than they take out, so if you’ve got fewer migrants coming in then you’ve got an issue with filling public sector jobs – particularly in the NHS – which is obviously disastrous,” he said.UK news in picturesPrime Minister Theresa May holds up a Belgium football shirt given to her by Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, center left, during a round table meeting at an EU summit in Brussels.

He has worked at the university for 12 years.After receiving the money, he said:\u0026nbsp“I am blessed and feeling good. I think the students should be there with me as well.\u0026nbspI try to do my best with the students to help them.\u0026nbspWhen I am cleaning the library, I chat to them and give them advice.\u0026nbspI try to encourage to them to do their best in life when they finish their studies.”A post said: “The Jamaican cleaner in the med library is the jolliest man I have ever met, he makes me smile even when I’m in the deepest depths of revision or trying to be, if you wanna reason to smile go talk to him for a min or two.\u0026nbspAnyone who has been to the biomedical sciences library knows who Herman the cleaner is. Simply put, he is the epitome of happiness.“All year round, this man works hours on end to provide us with a clean working space in which to study. But most importantly, his undying positive energy and chit-chat has managed to turn many students’ dark days into positive ones filled with joy.\u0026nbspWhether you’re just feeling generally down and out or stressed out due to exams, Herman is always there to speak to you.“This legend proves that happiness is not about what you own, what job you have or how much money you’ve got, but about appreciating what you currently have in life.”UK news in picturesPrime Minister Theresa May holds up a Belgium football shirt given to her by Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, center left, during a round table meeting at an EU summit in Brussels.

Dutch prime minister\u0026nbspMark Rutte said\u0026nbspMs May had to make a decision with her cabinet and that “the first, second, and third priority now is to solve the issue of the Irish border”.But despite other leaders’ focus on the Irish issue, senior UK government officials familiar with the prime minister’s dinner speech suggested there was little content on the border.UK should have come up with Brexit plan two years ago, Irish PM saysTime is running out to avoid a Brexit no deal, Irish PM tells MayThe ugliest secret of Brexit concerns your salaryGovernment criticised for slow progress on post-Brexit flight dealMr Varadkar told reporters on the doorstep of the European Council building: “I think it would have been helpful if they had had that white paper two years ago.\u0026nbsp“You would have thought that before people voted to leave the European Union they would have an idea what the new relationship would look like but I appreciate that that hasn’t happened, and two years later it still hasn’t happened.”He added that he looked forward to seeing the plan when it was produced, but suggested that Britain did not understand that is was not an equal partner with the EU.\u0026nbsp“It needs to understand that we’re a union of 27 member states, 500 million people. We have laws and rules and principles and they can’t be changed for any one country, even a great country like Britain,” he said.You would have thought that before people voted to leave the European Union they would have an idea what the new relationship would look like but I appreciate that that\u0026nbsphasn’t happened, and two years later it still\u0026nbsphasn’t happened“Any relationship that exists in the future between the EU and the UK isn’t going to be one of absolute equals: we’re 27 member states, the UK is one country, we’re 500 million people, the UK is 60 million. That basic fact has to be realised.”The Irish prime minister\u0026nbspsaid he would not accept a land border with the UK, but said to be “responsible” Ireland and other countries would have to make preparations at ports and airports for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.Addressing the chaos in Theresa May’s cabinet, Mr Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, told reporters in Brussels: “I do understand it’s difficult to come to agreements within her cabinet and the UK parliament, but she has to.“I don’t want to talk in apocalyptic terms. What I want to say is that I believe that the first, second, and third priority now is to solve the issue of the Irish border. When that is solved then so many other issues will be easier to discuss.”Over dinner Ms May said the UK wanted to continue to contribute to the security of the continent, telling the leaders: “Our ability to do so is being put at risk. The existing legal frameworks for third countries will not allow us to realise the ambitious future security partnership that I believe is in all our interest.\u0026nbsp“Under our current position the UK would for example be able to share information through key databases and agencies, such as SIS2, ECRIS, and Prum that allow our law enforcement to protect all European citizens.\u0026nbsp“We would no longer be able to share real-time alerts for wanted persons including serious criminals. We would be able to respond less swiftly to alerts for missing people from either side of the Channel and reunite them with our loved ones. Our collective ability to map terrorist networks and bring those responsible to justice would be reduced.\u0026nbsp“That is not what I want and I do not want to\u0026nbspbelieve it is what you want either. When you meet as\u0026nbsp27 tomorrow I urge you to consider what is in the best interests of the safety of your citizens and mine and give your negotiator a mandate to achieve this crucial objective.”Varadkar criticises government for not planning for Brexit before EU referendumInterpreting the prime minister’s words at dinner, a senior UK government official said: “Her message is that when you are considering the next steps of this you should consider the safety and security of your citizens as part of that.”Michel Barnier, the European Commission’s chief negotiator, has previously said that though information sharing could continue in some form, the UK would not be able to access EU-only databases.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

They must now set a deadline to make all blocks safe and take all steps necessary to see the work is done.”However, it is still unclear who will pay for the work after some building owners refused to meet the cost – instead telling residents to pay tens of thousands of pounds to make them safe.The government has resisted pressure to make owners pay – arguing leaseholders should “challenge the costs in courts if they are unreasonable” – although Theresa May hinted at a U-turn this week.Until now, it was thought that cladding that would fail fire safety tests introduced after the Grenfell disaster was on 141 private tower blocks.‘Like a war zone’: Harrowing testimony of first Grenfell firefighterGrenfell firefighter ‘did not consider evacuation’ ‘Grenfell two is in the post,’ says survivor who predicted deadly fireBeyonce and Jay Z pay tribute to Grenfell Tower fire victims in LondonIn his statement, Mr Brokenshire said local authorities had been “working hard to identify affected buildings in their areas” and had now tested more than 6,000 buildings.He also announced £1m for a new expert inspection team to speed up improvement works and “ensure building owners take the necessary action”.The minister said owners were responsible for the safety of their buildings and pledged the government would “hold them to account where they have unsafe cladding systems”.Town halls had begun\u0026nbsp“to compel them to take action” in some cases, MPs were told.Mr Brokenshire did not echo the prime minister’s threat that she was “not ruling anything out” if companies failed to pay to remove cladding.Speaking in the Commons, Ms May praised three companies – Barrett Homes, Legal and General and Taylor Wimpey – for “doing the right thing and taking responsibility”.And she said: “We want others to follow their lead… if they don’t, we are not ruling anything out at this stage.”Leaseholders have been forced to make insurance claims to cover the cost of removing and replacing the cladding, sometimes with the owners acting on their behalf.In many of the blocks, they have also been required to pay for round-the-clock patrols by fire wardens, because of the risk of a blaze.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

With the national team competing, cheap beer flowing and pretty locals smiling, many are understandably having the time of their lives. They are angry that anyone could write negative things about the magical, happy land they have come to love.\u0026nbsp“There would be twenty thousand of us here if it wasn’t for all the negativity,” says Glenn Jagger, 54.Alexander-Arnold: England disappointed to lose but happy to qualifyWhen do England play Colombia in the round of 16?Torres played with pride but mistakes will cost him dream Europe moveThe\u0026nbsplove is mutual. In Kaliningrad, locals have waited with excitement, and a little bit of trepidation, for the English. Some joked about leaving town for the duration.

Soviet apartment blocks dating from the 1950s were refashioned as Hanzel-and-Gretzel cottages. Potholes -\u0026nbspat least the ones on the World Cup route -\u0026nbspwere fixed. The ruins of the city’s German castle, blown up on Brezhnev’s orders in 1967, were also finally put on show. They had for decades been hidden behind ugly metal perimeter fences.And even the police were smiling. Outside the Radisson hotel, the English team hotel, they laughed at the crazy Englishmen with their painted faces and repetitive chants.

Tourists peer through murder-holes in the remains of the city’s nineteenth-century fortresses, while legends of the game stand high above them and stare back out at the city.Football provides a place to hide.

On Wednesday, the Maxim strip joint, located across the Radisson, decided it would also do its bit. On seeing their new\u0026nbspneighbours, management made the England team an offer it could not refuse: free use of any of their services. It was a generous proposal. A full programme of table dance, massage and shower would cost more than 10,000 roubles (£120).Manager Yevgenia Sorokina said the players had yet to take advantage of the offer -\u0026nbspat least to her knowledge. But the English supporters had more than made up for that disappointment. Business has been very brisk over the last few days, she said. Unusually, there hadn’t\u0026nbspbeen a single “incident”.“The girls decided they really like the English gentlemen,” she says. “They aren’t\u0026nbsprude or aggressive like Russian men can be, and they have been happy, really happy, and generous with their money.”\u0026nbspMs Sorokina said she was sure that more English fans had passed through the doors of the club than from any other country.\u0026nbsp“There were lots of Croatians, Serbs, not so many Spanish,” she said. “But many, many many more English -\u0026nbspand you can always tell its the English because they like to wear their uniforms.”\u0026nbspJudging by the white shirts inside the Kaliningrad Stadium, it did seem the numbers of England fans had grown from previous matches in Volgograd and Nizhny Novgorod. They may have even been the majority inside the near-capacity 33,000 crowd.\u0026nbspSome of those attending for the first time said they had been reassured by positive feedback from friends in Russia.\u0026nbsp“Russia has done an amazing job in resolving many of its worst impressions,” said Monit Meehan, a fan from Ohio, in the United States, who had adopted England as his team.\u0026nbsp“Most people are in Russia for the first time, and this will be their only take. So Putin will certainly feel this has been worth it.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

However, misty around east coasts to start with and often cloudier in parts of Scotland. Becoming more humid with time in the south.The World Meteorological Organisation definition of a heatwave is when the daily maximum temperature of more than five consecutive days exceeds the average maximum temperature by 5C, the normal period being 1961-1990.They are most common in summer when high pressure develops across an area.High-pressure systems are slow moving and can persist over an area for a prolonged period of time such as days or weeks.They can occur in the UK due to the location of the jet stream, which is usually to the north of the UK in the summer.This can allow high pressure to develop over the UK resulting in persistent dry and settled weather.The scorching summer of 1976 was the hottest summer since records began.It led to a severe drought owing to the exceptionally dry conditions, although it is thought that 1995 was drier.In the summer of 1976, Heathrow had 16 consecutive days over 30C from June 23 to July 8, and for 15 consecutive days from June 23 to July 7 temperatures reached 32.2C somewhere in England.But the single hottest temperature of 38.5C was set on August 10, 2003.When the mercury shoots up there are several obvious precautions to take.It is advised to make sure you drink a lot of water to make sure you stay hydrated during the hot spell.Keeping a bottle of sunscreen with you to soak up those UV rays is also highly advisable as is ensuring you have a hat to prevent sunstroke."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-9.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"720\" width=\"960","title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"So if youre after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further.Sign up to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun 10 - Receive the 10 biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-life stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TV\u0026ampShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Even better, the newsletters learn what you like, so over time you’ll see more of what you want and less of what you don’t.

Definitely, a real connection.”Who, of course, apart from Adam, who was going to be trouble from the moment he introduced himself as: “Not the serious man you see on Instagram.”A personal trainer unencumbered then by the flab of self-doubt who’s got a hint of the Blutos about him and flags up the moments he’s about to be cocky by ­saying: “Not being cocky but . . .”You can’t argue with the female ­reaction, though. Kendall, Megan, Rosie and Zara have all fallen for the swaggering great berk and Adam’s dumped all but the last of them with a smirk of self-satisfaction.As a way of endearing yourself to the core audience, it’s not good. As reality TV baddies go, however, he’s gold.It was inevitable then, I suppose, the fun police would also start taking an interest in him.Sure enough, there they were above the caption “Is Adam’s behaviour unacceptable?” on Thursday’s This Morning, where Katie Ghose, from Women’s Aid — who you’d hope had better stuff to do — was claiming: “Adam’s behaviour is a form of emotional abuse.”It didn’t take a genius to make the obvious point here. It took Towie’s Lauren Goodger, who said: “It’s just a TV show” and Adam’s merely taken the ­multiple dating rules at face value.So, if you have a genuine moral objection, take it up with ITV rather than feeding their publicity machine.Personally, I don’t. I have, though, had a nagging sense something was missing from this year’s run and it wasn’t until last week I worked out what it was either. The opposition.Big Brother, which is normally, head-to-head with Love Island, has disappeared and, I can almost guarantee, none of you have noticed or regretted its absence either.So not only has Love Island been funny, entertaining, immune to political correctness and proved a point, it’s removed the pox of Big Brother in the process.And if that isn’t public service broadcasting of the highest order and worthy of a plug, I dunno what is, frankly.The BBC failing to put Mark Lawrenson out of his obvious misery. Gary Lineker using apparently random World Cup trivia to draw attention to his goal-scoring exploits.The main BBC News actually doorstepping Lord Sugar over one stupid bladdy Tweet.This Morning’s Russell Grant spraying his astrological BS all over Love Island with the claim: “Rosie gave way to Adam too quickly ’cos of Mars in Venus and Venus and Leo.”And host Phillip Schofield failing to deliver the very obvious response: “Your head in Uranus.” TIME was, BBC comedy would make fun of Rick from The Young Ones, and all his ridiculous right-on pretensions.These days he’s running the show, in the guise of a man called Shane Allen who, not withstanding a thousand layers of state bureaucracy, has the easiest mission statement in television – make the viewers laugh.Apparently not, though. According to Shane, running BBC comedy these days is about finding “the diversity story”.Which sounds a bit like awarding the World Cup trophy to Switzerland, on the grounds of the squad’s ethnic mix.Except he doesn’t really mean diversity. It’s just those groups the BBC likes that Shane wants to employ, having made it abundantly clear “Oxbridge white blokes”, who’ve punched well above their weight, historically, are no longer required.So, at a stroke, you deny yourself any chance of finding talents and shows as brilliant, era-defining and clever as Sacha Baron Cohen (Ali G/Borat), Pete and Dud, Python, Fawlty Towers, Jimmy Carr, Fry \u0026amp Laurie, The Goodies and Not The Nine O’Clock News, while still very much lumbering us with the likes of Mel \u0026amp Sue, Famalam and Tittybangbang.For the privilege of institutionalising this failure and replacing an imagined prejudice with a very real one, I’ve also just learned we pay the BBC’s Head of Comedy £208,000 a year.Laugh?I didn’t.The Chase USA, Brooke Burns: “What South American country comes first alphabetically?”Mark: “Zimbabwe.”The Chase Australia, Andrew O’Keefe: “Beginning with the letter J, what word means liquid extracted from fruit?”Carroll: “Glucose.”Andrew O’Keefe: “What sedimentary rock is an anagram of the word leash?”Karen: “Coal.”And Andrew O’Keefe: “Which wig-shaped New York building was ­constructed in 1902?”Hat: “Trump Tower.”No, but I like the way you’re thinking, Hat.NEXT up from BBC2’s department of really dumb ideas?You take two of the greatest and most original comic talents of the last 30 years, Bob Mortimer and Paul Whitehouse.And send them bloody fishing.A combination which, in terms of things I don’t want to watch, is right up there with Vic Reeves \u0026amp Harry Enfield restoring vintage cars and Mel \u0026amp Sue attempting stand-up comedy.Mind you, the point of Gone Fishing also seemed lost on Bob Mortimer, as he trudged off to a Norfolk lake, angling for tench and asking his new mate: “What do we hope to achieve by the end of this, Paul?”Long pause.“A bit of inner peace?”What’s in it for the viewers became less and less clear as the silent pauses became longer.To the extent that, if you were lucky, Gone Fishing may just have been television to fall asleep to.If you weren’t, the last thing you may ever have heard was Bob asking: “Anything, Paul?”“No. Nothing.”On the plus side, though, corpses will have missed the moment where the BBC suddenly abandoned the fishing trip and, genuinely (I’m not making this bit up) sent Bob and Paul to a local micro-brewery.The resulting p***-up, you might not be wholly surprised to learn, wasn’t particularly well organised.Lee Dixon: “It’s a must-win game and Germany need at least a draw.”Phil Neville: “Mexico thoroughly deserve their 1-0 victory at half time.”Pablo Zabaleta: “At 3-1 down Tunisia need a goal to equalise the game.”Jason Mohammad: “One of the impressive things about Germany, the whole tournament, they were just so German-like.” Compiled by Graham Wray.THIS week’s winner is Sir Reg Holdsworth, in a wig, and Sir Reg Dwight (Elton), in a wig.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And he was right.Likewise when Boris Johnson said “f*** business” after Airbus threatened to pull jobs out of Britain post-Brexit, he wasn’t declaring war on firms that employ thousands of people.He was sick of the complaints from foreign companies with a vested interest in keeping the EU sweet — and in lobbying groups like the CBI which back Brussels over Britain.Of course the Tories are keen to ensure Brexit does as little damage as possible to businesses. Job-creation has been their biggest success since 2010.And of course the lack of certainty is worrying some firms. But they, in turn, need to understand this Government’s duty to honour the referendum in full.It cannot abandon red-line commitments — to end free movement, or to trade independently around the world — because big companies which have thrived within the EU don’t like them.Brussels is used to riding roughshod over inconvenient votes. That cannot and must not happen here.The sooner the EU’s corporate supporters grasp it the better.WHY is it OK for every country but England to show off their national pride?The Scots, Welsh, Irish, French, Americans — they love to see their flags adorning homes, offices and streets.Here, the left has made it borderline shameful to put up a St George cross. To them it means you’re parochial and even racist.It is time we killed off that myth and showed the same pride in our flag as the world does in theirs.What better time to start than with Harry Kane’s boys off to a flier in Russia? And where better than the full length of Whitehall?This brilliant idea by ex-Tory minister Nick Boles just needs Theresa May’s nod.Come on, PM . . . get cracking.THE Tories must honour their election vow to protect our troops from witch-hunts.The PM should read the letter from four ex-Cabinet ministers and act.It is a national disgrace that her Government lets veterans be hounded over action they took decades ago in the heat of battle.Our Boys would be right to doubt the Tories’ commitment to them.But at least Labour is not in power.Just one of its MPs turned up to debate bringing in a vital time limit on prosecutions.

And, indeed, free trade is what most people thought they were ­voting for in the 2016 referendum.Free trade, cunningly styled “no deal” by pro-Remain spin doctors, has always been the best option, but has become even more attractive, now that the intransigence and arrogance of EU ­negotiators has become clear.Fair play, Theresa May and David Davis — you gave the negotiations with the EU your best shot but it’s now time to take the road to freedom.Carping critics say they could have done better, but the public instinctively knows that you’ve tried hard and that it takes two to tango.So, let’s be bold and scrap all tariffs on Brexit day, March 29, 2019.It will immediately boost living ­standards, by reducing prices, and will be especially beneficial for the less well-off. Juncker will cry into his claret at the new, competitive UK.Even companies such as BMW and Airbus, which urged us to join the euro and asked their workers to vote Remain, will benefit.Their engines, and other components imported from the EU, would continue to be free of tariffs. However, ­components from outside the EU would also become tariff-free, which is not usually the case today. Not only that, but their workers would be better off too, which is a plus for any business.And instead of sending £39billion into Brussels’ unaudited coffers, let’s invest the money here.Dividing it equally among our 650 MPs would allow each one to spend £60million in their constituency, on local projects. If MPs don’t like that suggestion, the £39billion could instead be used to reduce taxes or government debt. Our democratically elected Parliament can debate the best approach and decide.Most of us understand Chancellor Philip Hammond’s dogged attempts to get public expenditure under control, after the trauma of the credit crunch.But, it must make sense to invest this money in the UK, rather than the EU.Finally, free of Juncker’s shackles, we can regain control of our fishing waters, boosting the morale and income of our beleaguered coastal communities.No longer will 60 per cent of fish in UK waters be landed by EU boats.The public, too, has its role to play now. Project Fear, promoted by the CBI, the Financial Times and big businesses, has tried to frighten us with threats of gridlocked Channel ports and lorry parks across Kent when we leave the EU.Few believe them, but let’s call their bluff. UK consumers and businesses should now start to favour and prefer non-EU and British products wherever possible, dramatically reducing pressure on those ports.Wetherspoon has started by swapping champagne for UK and Aussie sparkling wine, and German wheat beer for the English and Welsh equivalent.As a result of this tactic, the public is benefitting from equal or better quality and lower prices. And there are a large number of other EU products that can be replaced in all pubs and supermarkets in the next year or two.The public instinctively understands the benefits of world trade, so let’s make buying non-EU a national goal for the next few years.It’s tough on our excellent EU ­suppliers, of course, but that’s the price the continent is paying, unfortunately, for a failing and undemocratic system, with unelected apparatchiks like Juncker and Barnier in charge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And for the sake of society, it is absolutely right that this twisted soul was sentenced to life and should remain behind bars for decades.But the truth is that Kouider is not your average female inmate. In fact, she’s almost one of a kind.In the age of “equality”, it’s not fashionable to say that men and women are ­different. But when it comes to ­criminality, there can be no argument.Women make up a ­vanishingly small minority of those in the criminal justice system, representing less than five per cent — and in all but the most exceptional of ­circumstances, the crimes that get them incarcerated are, to put it plainly, petty.In 2016, more women were sent to prison to serve a sentence for theft than for violence against the person, robbery, sexual offences, fraud, drugs and ­motoring offences combined — and 80 per cent of those locked up for theft were shoplifters.In the past decade, the number of ­community sentences for women has fallen by nearly half. In 2016 alone, 8,447 women were put behind bars, depriving around 20,000 children of their mothers.These children will now be shunted around family members or placed in care, eating up even more limited resources than the £36,000 it costs to imprison someone for a year.And they will be stigmatised, probably for life, through no fault of their own. Whatever the macho “tough on crime” politicians say, it is plain that nothing is achieved by locking up women for minor offences.If we want to avoid pouring more of taxpayers’ hard-earned cash down the black hole of the broken prison ­system, we need to stop lumping ­vulnerable women in with violent men and start confronting the complex ­reasons behind their rare appearances in the ­justice system.Research shows that women in prison have often been victims of much more serious offences than the ones they are accused of committing.More than half report having experienced emotional, physical or sexual abuse as a child compared to under a third of men behind bars — and 57 per cent report having been ­victims of domestic violence.Depressingly, because many women fear disclosing abuse, both figures are likely to be an underestimate.The abusers, it would seem, are also the ones pushing their female partners into a life of crime.Nearly half of women in prison (48 per cent) questioned for the Surveying ­Prisoner Crime Reduction survey reported having ­committed offences to support someone else’s drug use, ­compared to just 22 per cent of men.Manipulated, under-educated and all but broken, these women suddenly ­surface in the criminal justice system, ­desperate for the help which would enable them to put their lives back on track.But instead of offering it, we treat them just the same as the low-lives who ground them down in the first place.And it’s creating a cycle of crime.Overall, 48 per cent of women leaving prison are reconvicted within one year.For those serving sentences of less than 12 months, the reconviction rate rises to 61 per cent.This statistic is hardly surprising when you bear in mind that many women lose everything as a result of imprisonment, and 60 per cent of them don’t have homes to go to on release.Without accommodation, it is much harder to get a job or training ­placement, or arrange benefits or care for children so, understandably, they turn back to petty crime.Women like Kouider must always be locked away and no one is suggesting for one moment that serious crimes should go unpunished. But when you have nearly half of all women in jail to support the drug use of someone else and nearly half having attempted suicide at some point in their lifetime — a figure more than seven times higher than that of the general population — it would very much suggest that ­incarceration is not the wisest response.And at last, the Government is latching on. Justice Secretary David Gauke has now abandoned plans for five community prisons for women in England and Wales. Instead, the Ministry of Justice will trial five residential centres to help offenders with issues such as finding work and drug rehabilitation.It may be a small step — vulnerable men are still at risk of falling through the net and Gauke must address that, too — but it’s in the right direction.If we are to stop our shuddering prison system from imploding entirely, we must start by separating the victims from the criminals.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here, and across the globe. Pourquoi? (That means “why” and is usually accompanied by a shrug and slightly hysterical hand gestures.)Fewer and fewer British kids are learning French in school. The number studying this absurd language has dropped by 30,000 in the past seven years. Instead, our children are learning languages which might actually prove to be useful later on in life.French is useful only if you visit France — and even then they’ll pretend not to understand you.Oh, and a small bunch of arid and desolate African countries which — trust me on this — you are never going to visit. Unless you want a dose of the Ebola virus or your head chopped off. French does not make the top ten of languages spoken worldwide.It only just crawls into the top 20 — between Marathi and Korean, since you asked. Marathi is spoken by some people in India. Not a huge amount of people, frankly. Nice people though, I’m sure.The Africans have learned the utter uselessness of French.In the past few years two countries from that continent have ditched French as the second language and replaced it with — of course — English. That’s Rwanda and Gabon. The switch has proved very popular indeed. More countries are set to follow suit.Do you know where else they don’t speak French any more? France. Well, in French universities. Science subjects such as physics and maths are taught in English.This is because foreign students coming to France don’t want to have to encumber themselves by learning a new language which will be of less use to them later than Swahili or Gaelic.This has been too long in coming. Right now, more and more British schools are switching to Spanish.This makes sense because while 437million people in the world speak Spanish as a first language — i.e. Spain, Central and most of South America — only about 75million speak French.That’s France, half of Belgium and about nine people in Switzerland.But never mind Spanish, important though it is. Foreign languages are too often neglected by British students.And yet we need them to compete in the world. English is the international language of commerce and culture, sure.I would make it compulsory for kids to learn Mandarin from the age of five. And as a second choice, Spanish — which we’re getting good at — or Arabic.Hell, we could do with knowing what that lot are up to. Our security services have struggled because too few English people have any knowledge of Arabic.And how about Russian?We need a bit of a revolution in the way we teach foreign languages here.For too long we have glided by thinking we need to learn nothing. Just a verse or two of Frere Jacques, that’ll do.But the world is changing and our schools need to change with it.Right now they are beginning to do so, but too slowly.Get the kids learning stuff which will help them compete in the world. And shove French in the trash can of history.Ding dang dong, indeed.THE wags seem to have had a nice night out in St Petersburg.Good for them.I do miss Abbey Clancy from the line-up, though.I suppose it would be a bit much to put Peter Crouch up front just so we got a chance to see her again.JUST as the England team looks like it’s going places and everyone’s happy, there’s a beer shortage.This is because of a national shortage of carbon dioxide.How the hell can we have a shortage of THAT?Your average human breathes out almost three pounds of the stuff every day.This is a national crisis and I think I have the answer.We need to get some people who are of no other use to the world to sit in vast vats of flat lager, belching continuously.Diane Abbott, for example.Humans involved in strenuous exercise exhale even more CO2 – maybe 12 pounds a day. So, Diane, on a treadmill, in a vast vat of lager, belching continuously. Yum.SO, the adolescent, unemployable liberal scumbags are still trying to get Donald Trump’s visit to the UK cancelled.Lefties who cannot bear to hear people express different views to their own will be staging infantile protests across London.There are even plans to have a giant blimp of the US president flying across the capital.A typically nasty and childish little prank by people who cannot abide democracy.And who do not care that the US is our major ally – and especially important once we have left the European Union.The protests are being supported by such organisations as ActionAid, which calls itself a charity.Make sure you never give those people any of your money.And one more thing, you protestors. You think Trump is only in power for four years? Think again. He will win again.Just as other populists are winning elections across Europe.The liberals have lost the argument and they are losing at the polls.NOTHING has given me as much pleasure during the World Cup as watching that fat, cheating coke-head Diego Maradona being hauled out of his seat, drunk out of his skull and incapable of standing.Hand of God – yeah. And the septum of Danniella Westbrook.The only downside was that the Argies won their game against Nigeria, undeservedly. They now face France in the next round.Argentina versus France. Like deciding who you want to win in a fist fight between Jeremy Corbyn and Nick Clegg. You kind of hope they’ll annihilate each other and no team goes through.It’s been a great World Cup so far, and very well run by the Russians. Best teams? Croatia, certainly. But England are still in the chasing pack.And how very sad to wave goodbye to the Germans. Cheerio! Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Who would have thought?Did he mention that Airbus, who have been warning of plague and pestilence if we dare to leave, have just been found to have received illegal subsidies worth £17billion from . . . the EU?Did he tell his audience that even Financial Times bosses — a paper so comfortable in Brussels’ bosom it could redesign its masthead as a blue-and-yellow brassiere — think German car manufacturers need a UK trade deal, regardless of what BMW say? Did he heck.Big businesses have done very well out of the EU for years. They’ll resist every possible attempt to reform it or improve it and in Greg Clark they’ve got a man unimaginative enough to believe everything they say.There are plenty of other businesses who are looking to the future with confidence and are excited about Britain striking out on their own.And those outfits who are complaining about Brexit will adjust, just as they did when we (thankfully) didn’t join the Euro, because we’ve got the fifth largest economy in the world and they’d be mad to turn their back on us.It’s time the PM backed Brexit voters over corporate doom-mongers.LOVE Island’s Adam is a nasty piece of work.How ITV can justify him still being on the show despite being caught sending sleazy messages to a 17-year-old girl is beyond us.People have been thrown off for much less. ITV’s shameless pursuit of ratings can’t justify him still being there.Boot him.VAR has made the World Cup a much better experience.Rather than arguing about decisions in the pub for years afterward, they get sorted out straight away.Yes, there are niggles. But between Neymar’s ludicrous dive and South Korea’s (wonderful) goal, more ­decisions are right than ever before.Dinosaur Premier League bosses should introduce it next season.The only downside is that it might have ruled out Geoff Hurst’s goal in ’66.But today’s probably painful enough for our German friends...Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

smashing Wednesdays high of 31.9C.Highs were recorded across the UK -  making it the first time in five years that temperatures have hit 30C in all four nations of the UK.Met Office meteorologist Bonnie Diamond said: Last year for England there was a warm spell where they had five days over 30C but what makes this current spell different is that its nationwide.Its staying sunny and warm and dry for most (into next week).There is a small risk of seeing some showers developing in the far south-west but otherwise it will be dry.But the heatwave has sparked health warnings with conditions expected to remain hot and sunny over the weekend.The Met Offices heat-health watch alert remains at level two, meaning social and healthcare services are at the ready to reduce harm from a potential heatwave.Authorities have also issued warnings to cut shower times down to just four minutes as temperatures continue to sizzle.With no rain on the horizon, the South East is set for its driest June since records began.The last time the area received so little rain was in 1925, recording just 3.4mm.A number of homes were evacuated and pockets of fire continue to burn across an area of around six kilometres, Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said.After a very dry month, there is still no rain on the horizon, particularly if the potential thunderstorms fail to materialise this weekend.The heat has already claimed casualties - a 17-year-old boy was recovered from the River Aire in Leeds in the early hours of Wednesday morning following a search a rescue operation.It is believed he got into difficulties while swimming on Tuesday evening.Elsewhere the body of 13-year-old Ryan Evans who went missing on Monday after getting into difficulty in Westport Lake in Stoke-on-Trent was recovered from the water.The body of 31-year-old Edward Savage was also pulled from the water at Mercers Lake in Nutfield, Surrey, on Monday.The heat has caused havoc for commuters after rail services imposed speed limits on trains due to overheating tracks caused by the steel on tracks to expand and sometimes buckle.South Western Railway said temperatures were expected to reach 47C on many parts of its route this week.Services on the London Waterloo to New Malden line are being subjected to speed restrictions from 11am each day until Friday to reduce the likelihood of buckling.A spokesman for the Met Office said: Over the next few days the high pressure will remain so there will be blue skies across the UK and that will last certainly into the weekend.We may see some thunderstorms on Sunday or Monday but nothings certain.But we can expect these sorts of high temperatures to be reached certainly until Saturday.The heatwave could even top a blistering 38C in the coming months, raising fears this summer could be even worse than the Lucifer heatwave last year.The RSPCA also called on pet owners to keep a close eye on their animals in the heat after receiving 625 calls about animals in hot environments between June 11 and 24 - the majority about dogs in hot cars.A spokeswoman said: (Were receiving) almost two calls every hour, despite the charitys key advice being to call the police on 999 in the event of an emergency.Public Health England has issued a warning saying the extreme heat may pose a risk to the most vulnerable.And while the mercury continues to rise in the UK, Englands World Cup team will also have to contend with the heat in Russia as they take on Belgium in the final group game.The Met Office forecasts the temperature for Thursdays game at the Kaliningrad stadium to be 22C (71.6F)."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000416736996.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"forest destruction maps deforestation world football pitch","story":"That means enough trees to span the whole of Italy disappeared as forests from the Amazon to the Congo were burned and knocked down.The total loss topped 113,000-square-miles last year, according to Global Forest Watch who created an interactive graphic showing the devastation.Its data, released this week, measures tree cover loss or the death of a trees leaves.The study found tropical forests around the globe lost 61,000-square-miles in 2017 which equates to roughly the size of Bangladesh.That makes 2017 the second-worst year on record after - 2016 - since researchers began gathering the data back in 2001.The Democratic Republic of Congo, Brazil, Indonesia, Madagascar and Malaysia suffered the biggest losses in 2017.Brazil lost 17,000-square-miles of tree cover in 2017 alone, down 16 percent from the previous year.The fires which devastated large parts of the southern Amazon are partly to blame for the huge deficit.Colombias losses were a much smaller proportion of the total but the South American country did experience a worrying jump.Its tree cover loss rose 46 per cent from 2016 and the 1,600-square-miles lost was more than double its average from 2001 to 2015.Tropical forests were lost at a rate equivalent to 40 football fields per minute in 2017, said Frances Seymour of the World Resources Institute (WRI).He added: Vast areas continue to be cleared for soy, beef, palm oil and other globally traded commodities. Much of this clearing is illegal.Norwegian Environment Minister Ola Elvestuen said the pace of forest losses was catastrophic and threatened efforts to slow global warming.Elvestuen added: Forest destruction is driving climate change... Norway has invested about £2.1billion to safeguard tropical forests in the past decade.Justin Adams of the the Nature Conservancy environmental group said only three per cent of public finance for slowing climate change went to natural solutions like forests.He said well-managed forests can be a source of jobs and economic growth but tree cover is just one measure of the state of the worlds forests.The UNs Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says the loss of forests worldwide slowed to just a net 12,700-square-miles a year from 2010-15.The FAO says that a forest where trees are deliberately felled to make way for new plantings is still a forest but Global Forest Watch registers the felling as tree cover loss.Anssi Pekkarinen, a senior forestry officer of the FAO, said that the FAO method of identifying the underlying land use gives a much more comprehensive picture on the worlds forests."},{"url":null,"title":"dog trapped inside lorry mcdonalds 40 minutes honks horn","story":"A witness claimed they saw the little pooch locked in the vehicle as temperatures reached a scorching 27C outside a McDonalds in Somerset.Teen Gabrielle Dart said she had heard the vehicles horn beeping as it sat outside the Frome branch of the fast food chain.Speaking to Somerset Live, the 17-year-old said: We heard a car horn which kept going off and realised it was the dog honking the horn.So I took some photos, got the manager and alerted them.The rush to help the dog comes after cops were forced to break into a blazing hot car to rescue two dogs left in a car by their owner in York.The York officers involved in the rescue attempt said even they were struggling to breathe as they worked to free the dogs from the car.Gabrielle said she was horrified to see the dog locked in the car in Somerset on Monday, June 25.She claimed a window had been opened a crack.The teen said she had notified a local shop manager but when they returned to the car park, the lorry and dog had gone.According to the RSPCA, Britons could end up with a criminal record if something happens to their dog after its left alone in a car.It is not illegal to leave a pet unattended in a vehicle.But if the animal becomes ill or dies as a result, you could be charged with animal cruelty.If convicted under the Animal Welfare Act 2006, drivers can be jailed for six months and slapped with an unlimited fine.A car sitting in 24C conditions outside can reach 34C in just ten minutes, and a dangerous 43C after half an hour -

They then headed to an address in West Park, where Isidore was arrested and charged with culpable negligence, a misdemeanor, police said.Isidore has been released after posting bail.“That guy is crazy,” she said of Francis. “He won’t leave me alone.”Francis, meanwhile, told WPLG that both he and Isidore needed to use the Mercedes, which they co-own, according to the station.“She turned the engine on, dropped it in reverse and turned,” Francis told the station. “That’s when things took a turn.”Francis said he was actually on the phone with police as he hung onto the hood while Isidore drove from Broward to Miami-Dade counties and back.“She’s swerving the car and I’m on top of the car,” Francis told a dispatcher, according to the 911 call. “I really need help.”Francis said he managed to remove the key from the car’s ignition once they reached West Park. He then told police he didn’t want to press charges against the mother of his daughter. He also refused to provide a statement, WPLG reports.Days after the incident, Francis said he’s still frightened by what happened.“This woman is going to kill me,” he told the station. “She’s really out to kill me.”A version of this story first appeared on the New York Post"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000416757581.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"church silences bells hangovers","story":"Several people complained that the Sunday 8am clanging was disturbing them as they slept off heavy Saturday nights.Vicar Christopher Brown said: “Several people want a long sleep after a night in the pub so we’ll be neighbourly and stop the bells.”He even sympathised with non-worshippers near St Mary’s Church, Fishguard, Pembrokeshire.

For years, the 68-year-old has been a scourge of the Royal Family and many were questioning whether it was appropriate for her to making such claims against the much-revered couple, who are in their nineties.Some dismissed them as “total bunkum”. Respected commentator Judy Wade said last night: “I have never seen Lady Colin Campbell with a member of the Royal Family, or on a job about the Royal Family. You can say whatever you like about the Queen because she won’t sue, but it doesn’t mean it is true.”In her 320-page book, The Queen’s Marriage — which she theatrically unveiled at a London press event — Lady Colin “reveals” what she says are secrets of the royal bedchamber. She insists “a variety of sources” told her of Philip and the Queen’s sexual passion, especially on their honeymoon at Lord Mountbatten’s Hampshire home, Broadlands.Using the Queen’s family nickname of Lilibet, she writes that “the servants were full of talk about how patently Lilibet enjoyed her introduction to the pleasures of the flesh”.“He also let slip to his other Mountbatten cousin, Patricia, that Lilibet had the most beautiful skin all over. There has never been any doubt that they had a torrid time between the sheets. It started in her marriage and continued throughout, and there was never any secret about it. Philip himself said she was a goer and in civilised circles an appreciation of sex has never been regarded as shameful but a sign of good health.”Lady Colin also described Philip as a “great flirt”, claiming she had first-hand experience. She said last night: “He loves the company of beautiful women. He’s a huge flirt. I don’t know any pretty girl he hasn’t flirted with. He’s flirted with me before. He’s never said anything untoward, he’s just flirtatious. The sort of thing he says is, ‘You’re looking good tonight’, but he is a flirt.The Queen didn’t mind at all. She gave him free rein to have Cavalier Servente — where you have friendships with the opposite sex, which are very close. To Philip they were like pets, they were his playthings. He even called them his playmates, they shared physical activities like carriage driving, and interests. It is a constructive way of keeping him occupied and entertained.At the book launch, Lady Colin added that Philip’s flirting helped fuel rumours he had cheated on the Queen. She said: “Problems started as soon as The Queen came to the throne, when courtiers went out of their way to cause problems within the marriage. Up to the point of accession they had a happy, picture-perfect marriage.”The book also suggests that when the Queen helped prevent Princess Margaret marrying divorced royal equerry Peter Townsend, her sister took revenge and spread rumours about Philip cheating.“A fashionable psychiatrist, who was very much part of the smart set, told me, ‘She cracked up under the strain of her sister’s revelations about Prince Philip’s activities’.”But Lady Colin said she believes Philip did not sleep with his close friend, Lady Penny Romsey, who he was often seen in the company of, causing much gossip. She writes: “Penny’s friends also have no doubt that the relationship, though passionate and loving, does not, and never did, include sex.”Other royals targeted in the book include Prince Charles, who she brands a “world-class moaner” — behaviour fostered by the Queen Mother, who encouraged Charles to be extravagant and luxury-loving. Lady C writes: “This caused conflict with his parents, both of whom were thrifty by nature.”Lady Colin said she “never had any pressure from the Palace” to tone down her revelations. She said defiantly: “They know I am honest and they’ve known about this book for a while.“What I have written stands the test of time and if it’s going to come out it may as well come out through somebody who is even-handed and balanced, and has no anti-Monarchist agenda.”But doubts were raised about how well-placed Lady Colin really is to know such intimate details.Judy Wade, who has written seven books about the royals, said: “She does dish the dirt. Readers should approach with caution.”The Queen’s former press secretary, Dickie Arbiter, said: “I will not dignify anything Lady Colin Campbell writes or says with a comment.”A spokeswoman from Buckingham Palace declined to comment.After hitting puberty and insisting that she was a girl, she claims her wealthy father reacted by sending her to a hospital and having her pumped full of steroids.  But by the time she was 18 her father accepted her as a woman.Three years later she was a successful model living as “Georgie”, having finally had the corrective surgery she craved.  In 1974, aged 24, she hit the headlines when she married confirmed bachelor Lord Colin Campbell having known him for just five days.The hedonistic couple had a rocky and unusual marriage – one time they supposedly invited a stranger into their bed so an unwilling Lord Colin would consummate their marriage.  At first she confided in her husband about her troubled childhood, but things turned sour and he allegedly abused her and broke her jaw.  After just eight months the couple dramatically split up.Lord Colin sold his wife’s gender-change story to the papers as their divorce became ever more acrimonious. Yet his family had also been caught up in a sex scandal in 1963 when his mother, Lady Margaret the 11th Duchess of Argyll, was pictured performing a sexual act on a man whose head was not captured in the photograph.Later, Lady Colin revealed the “headless man” was American businessman William H Lyons, and claimed his identity had been an open family secret.  Despite Lady Colin’s turbulent marriage and eight-year affair with aristocrat James Buchanan-Jardine, the mum of two is perhaps best known for her tell-all book about Princess Diana, which revealed an affair with James Hewitt and told of the princess’s battle with bulimia.Although at the time the claims were thought to be extraordinary, Lady Colin was proved right on both counts.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That was exactly what the meeting had been about, and everybody there knew it.The summit was Operation Save Mutti. Their mission: To stop Merkel’s government collapsing by thrashing out a tough stance on immigration to calm her critics. It’s quite a turnaround.Once, Merkel, with her open-door refugee policy, was queen of Europe. Now she’s a beggar. Suddenly, European politics has changed beyond recognition.The tide has turned. Those making the case for an open Europe are haunted and chastised. They are losing elections.Italy’s new coalition of left and right-wing populists is a fiesta of political contradictions, but they share one goal: To stop the migration population from growing.They want a European refugee policy that is pretty similar to what Austria is advocating.Sebastian Kurz, Austria’s young and energetic Chancellor, has begun to talk about “an axis of the willing” between his country, Italy and Germany.He has canvassed allies in Germany for his ideas on migration reform.Many in Merkel’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) are tired of her and her centrist style of leadership and see Kurz as their hero.Earlier this month he staged a press conference with Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s interior minister, coalition partner and chairman of the Christian Social Union (CSU) party.Seehofer now wants Germany to turn away migrants who do not have documents or who first applied for asylum in another EU country. Merkel has refused. If the decades-old CDU-CSU alliance ends over this issue, Merkel’s government would collapse.Until recently, it was assumed that Merkel would last until the next elections in three years’ time.Now many are betting she won’t even make it through the summer.There are two kinds of European solidarity now: The Merkel type and the Kurz type.To survive, Merkel must find a way to reconcile the two, but she is perhaps the only leader in Europe who thinks that is still possible.Countries to the north, south and east of Germany have already moved away from her refugee vision.Denmark and Sweden reinstated border controls in 2015.Viktor Orban, in Hungary, and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, in Poland — often dismissed as loonies and fruitcakes — feel that their views on immigration have been vindicated, not just at home but across Europe. And why shouldn’t they?Much as their migration policies are flawed, they are winning the battle of ideas over border controls and openness.They have many new allies in European capitals. Slovakia and the Czech Republic now have leaders who complain about Muslim immigration.And yes, Emmanuel Macron’s victory was astonishing — but a third of France still voted for right-winger Marine Le Pen.Merkel’s view of Europe was the consensus. When Macron took power, it was hoped Europe would be purged of grubby thoughts about migrants.Merkel’s case for a common European policy on refugees seemed likely to win.But the elections in Italy and Austria changed all that. Having populists in former Soviet bloc states is one thing. Having them running Western European states is quite another.The balance of power keeps changing, shifting ever further from Merkel.The incoming Slovenian PM, Janez Jansa, is a migration hardliner and, like others in the Balkan region, sees Europe’s political future as being represented by Budapest rather than Berlin.So what to do? Merkel now stands as the charity case, not the powerbroker.Macron offers her some respite, saying he will help her by taking back the few asylum seekers in Germany who registered first in France.But far more refugees will have registered first in Italy, and the odds on its new government taking them are slim. In Austria, Kurz is focusing on a plan to force refugees to apply for asylum before they enter the EU.When Austria assumes the EU’s rotating presidency next month, Kurz will make this a centrepiece of his agenda. Kurz’s stance is unacceptable to Merkel. Belgium and the Netherlands are also protesting because they fear that forcing migrants to apply from overseas centres will lead to inhumane migration detention camps, as seen in Australia.But can Merkel fight against it?If she wants to stay in power she will need to be wary of those in her own CDU ranks who are closer to Seehofer.If her leadership recently took them to their worst election results since 1949, what might await them after more years of Merkel in power?Whatever she now chooses to do will cause her reputation to crumble.If she fires Seehofer, it may be the end of the German centre-right as the party in charge.If she goes along with Austrian and Italian demands to turn back migrants, she will be admitting that her open-door policy on migration killed her own vision of a welcoming Europe.She has run out of good options, as well as political authority. She may limp on in Germany for a few more years, but her long reign in Europe has ended.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Crew instructions mean crew instructions.”The flight attendant — who said she had “zero tolerance” for the “attitudes” she was receiving from Rodgers and other passengers — then threatened to remove another passenger who came to Rodgers’ defence, according to the post.The plane then returned to the gate, at which point the flight attendant directed an officer to remove Rodgers and other passengers. In all, four adults and a young boy were taken off the flight, including a Latina woman who asked the flight attendant to sit down so the plane could depart.Some Instagram users said they thought race played a role in the incident, characterizing her response as “racist,” condescending and deplorable.“This is straight bully tactics on the flight attendant’s part,” one user wrote. “You complied, other passengers vouched for you calmly, yet she wield her big stick across all of you.”A SkyWest Airlines spokeswoman told WGCL that reps are now looking into the allegations of discrimination aboard the Delta Connection regional flight.“We are disappointed that our customers had this experience and are working with our partner Delta Connection to follow up directly with the customers involved,” the statement read.A Delta rep, meanwhile, told the station that the airline accommodated the passengers’ needs.

These are likely to go unfulfilled, because he flaunts them so crassly.Yet before acknowledging that the Armed Forces need more money, which they do, we should recognise how hard it is to configure Britain’s defence and security posture at a time when threats and the means to address them are changing at awesome speed.Countering terrorism in some ways represents the least ­difficult element, because it is the only peril the public really cares about.It is evident to all save ­disciples of Julian Assange that electronic surveillance through GCHQ, supported by the intelligence services, armed police and military special forces, deserves generous funding, which it nowadays receives.It is much more difficult to identify the appropriate tools with which to equip the Armed Forces to meet the strategic threats, of which Russia ­represents the most obvious.When President Putin favours hybrid warfare embracing covert special forces, fake news, cyber attacks and subversion, are tanks and infantry battalions the appropriate responses?When US backing for Nato is wavering and key nations such as Germany forswear a serious combat capability, alongside what allies can we hope to present a common front?These are big and hard ­questions.A couple of months ago at a round-table dinner, some of Britain’s top generals and ­strategic gurus held forth about the threats as they see them.Afterwards, the former Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, who was among the guests, told me that he had been disappointed by the ­unoriginality of the ideas expressed.Here were the brightest and best in the war studies ­universe, he suggested, still thinking inside the parameters of the familiar, when much that is unfamiliar is evolving all around us.In planning for the future, Army commanders deserve sympathy, because they are compelled to observe ­constraints imposed by public sentimentality, to which ­ministers make obeisance.For instance, the chronically under-recruited Scottish regiments should be reduced, instead of having their ranks filled with Fijians (yes, really), but that is politically unthinkable.Nobody dares to axe a foot guards battalion, because the Guards Division remains a powerful trades union.The Gurkhas, whose infrastructure and dependants’ costs now make them uneconomic, cannot be touched because no minister will risk Joanna ­Lumley once more taking to the streets on their behalf. ­Politicians, in their own defence, are entitled to point out that the leaders of the Armed Forces are often poor judges of strategic planning.The admirals of two decades ago begged, fought and pleaded for the Navy’s two preposterous carriers, which I have compared to the Egyptian pyramids — huge consumers of resources for negligible practical utility.It was always obvious that the F-35 aircraft for which they were designed are properly unaffordable by modern Britain.Beyond being described by Americans as “the planes that ate the Pentagon” because of their fantastic cost, recent assessments show them ­performing poorly in the key ground attack role, as do the RAF’s Typhoons, conceived as high-altitude interceptors.Moreover, it was always plain that almost the entire Royal Navy’s residual strength will be required to escort the carriers on active service, while they are incapable of inshore operation.A strong government and Defence Secretary would mothball the behemoths in a display of courage such as was last shown by Denis Healey in 1968 when he decided to withdraw British forces from east of Suez.Forces need more of almost everythingThey would also scrap the Trident deterrent replacement, again a big willy gesture for a little willy nation, inappropriate to our diminished status in the world.I know almost no one whom I

Sometimes they are drama-packed, make-or-break affairs which become long nights of high-stakes brinkmanship. Other times, people just want to watch the football. Theresa May makes no pretence of being the world\u0027s biggest football fan – despite being a fair-weather Wimbledon supporter it\u0027s no secret cricket is her sport of choice.  But even the Prime Minister realised her latest Brussels date would be overshadowed by the England Belgium match – which was just as well because she had little good Brexit news to report.  Here are the five biggest things were learned from the June EU Council summit. 1. EU leaders are frustrated at the pace of Brexit talks  Arriving in Brussels, they lined up to have a pop at the sluggish speed, or lack of, in negotiating Britain\u0027s orderly departure – still scheduled for March 29. The deadline for a withdrawal agreement has always been October and that\u0027s been the case from day one. “However, we did expect that we would make more progress, or any progress, at this summit in June. “That hasn\u0027t been.” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte warned time was running out to strike a deal ahead of the March 29 scheduled withdrawal. I am not losing patience but time is getting shorter and shorter to come to an agreement,” he said. 2. Even Theresa May now admits it\u0027s all going a bit slowly  Given the evidence and the fact fellow leaders were going public, she would have looked foolish to deny the obvious. She said: I think both sides are keen to continue that work at a faster pace than we have done up till now and certainly we would welcome that. 3. The EU cares far more about migration then it does about Brexit  Theresa May was given a brief moment right at the start of dinner to update leaders on the progress of Brexit talks. It didn\u0027t take very long. Then the EU leaders got down to the real business of the June council meeting – to try and thrash out a solution to the crisis gripping its southern border. And that went long into the night. German Chancellor Angela Merkel described the talks as make or break for the union. And she\u0027s right – the crisis is an existential issue for the bloc. Italy\u0027s new populist government has had enough of boatloads of migrants arriving on its shores, mainly having set sail from Libya. Italian PM Giuseppe Conte warned: “Italy no longer has a need for words and statements, we need concrete acts.” Hungarian PM Viktor Orban pointed to the democratic deficit in the EU, having previously vowed not to be bound by EU rules. He said: The main issue is not migration, the issue is democracy in Europe ... it is about what the people believe, what should be done. 4. Theresa May struggles to cope with the unexpected  It was a bit cruel but it was also very funny – the way she was ambushed by Belgian counterpart Charles Michel who presented her with a Belgian football shirt, with No 10 and “Hazard” on the back. Because Eden Hazard plays No 10 for Belgium – geddit? And definitely not because she is a hazard who lives in No 10 Downing Street, oh no. How did our PM deal with this? Did she whip from her handbag a CD of Baddiel and Skinner\u0027s Football\u0027s Coming Home? Did she pull out an England shirt, stick it over her head and punch the air shouting “EN-GER-LAND!!!”? Did she burst into strains of Jerusalem? No, of course not, don\u0027t be silly. She laughed. A lot. Like she didn\u0027t really mean it and like she was forcing herself to outwardly appear like she saw the funny side while inside we all know she was thinking: “Oh God, there are TV cameras and photographers and this is going to be on the evening news and it looks like all of Europe is having a laugh at our expense. Again.” Yes, they were.  Obviously four hours later, the Number 10 Twitter account posted a picture of Mrs May handing over a Three Lions jersey in return, and tried in vain to spin it as exchanging shirts.

Government figures show building began on only 160 local authority properties across the WHOLE of England, between January and March. The number of housing association homes started also fell 14%, to 5,230. The drop comes despite Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May’s promise to kick start a council house building blitz. Mrs May declared it was her personal mission to fix the housing crisis and pledged to build 300,000 homes a year overall by the mid-2020s. Yet just 39,350 homes started being built in the three months to March - a fall of 8% on a year earlier.  For the last full year that figure was 157,480, down 3% on the year before. The number of homes completed was also down, despite a chronic housing shortage. The drop was blamed in large part on severe weather at the end of winter which forced house builders to down tools. The period from 1946 through to the 1980s saw a boom in council house building. But that changed with the growth in housing associations, which coincided with Tory Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s right to buy scheme.

Josephine Iyamu used a powerful witch doctor to exert a control over her victims. The 53-year-old was a ringleader of an international human trafficking crime network and lived in a huge Nigerian mansion complete with a servants’ quarters. She used the profits to fund her lavish lifestyle including jaunts to Europe to buy \u0026pound700 designer shoes. Iyamu charged each of her victims up to €38,000 - more than \u0026pound33,600 - to arrange for their travel to Europe. She would first make the vulnerable women undergo Juju ceremonies which would involve them drinking blood containing worms and eating the heart of a chicken.  The victims would then be forced to endure an arduous five day journey to the Libyan coast - which saw them shot at, ambushed and gang raped. They would then catch an inflatable boat crammed with hundreds of people to Italy before being moved into Germany to work as prostitutes. German police identified Iyamu as the ringleader of a Nigerian human trafficking operation after a brothel owner reported suspicions over one of his workers’ paperwork last January. Iyamu and her husband Efe Ali-Imaghodor, 60, were arrested at Heathrow Airport on August 24 last year after travelling back from Nigeria. Mr Ali-Imaghodor was cleared of one count of perverting the course of justice. Police found Iyamu in possession of seven mobile phones and more than 30 SIM cards linked them to the German investigation. Officers also discovered a piece of paper detailing a list of items needed as part of the Juju ceremonies and another with telephone numbers of criminal associates. Iyamu was today convicted by a jury on five counts of arranging to facilitate travel of another person for exploitation, following a trial at Birmingham Crown Court. She was also found guilty of perverting the course of justice after paying Nigerian police to arrest one of the victims’ relatives in a bid to stop the woman giving evidence against them in the trial while both were in police custody in the UK. The jury of ten women and one man took 11 hours to return their verdict following the eight-week long trial. Iyamu, who was dressed in a turquoise shawl, held her hand to her mouth bowed her head as the verdict was read out. Judge Richard Bond said: “This is the first case in England and Wales under the new 2015 act whereby people have been trafficked from one country into another country.  “This is going to set a precedent when it comes to sentence. Whatever sentence I impose, I anticipate it will be challenged.” Iyamu - aka \u0027Madam Sandra\u0027 - had worked 37 days in 2016/17 as an agency nurse in south east London hospitals for NHS Capitol Staffing Services. She lived with husband Ali-Imaghodor, a cloakroom attendant, in an ex-council home in Bermondsey, south east London. The National Crime Agency (NCA) investigation found the victims - aged 24 to 30 - were made to undergo Juju rituals which exercised a control tighter than chains. They were so terrified by the threat of voodoo magic that they had to undergo another black magic “revokation” ceremony to undo the oath they took to pay Iyamu. Kay Mellor, NCA senior investigating officer, said Iyamu, originally from Liberia, became a British citizen in 2009 - which allowed her to be prosecuted under section 2 of the Modern Slavery Act. The officer explained she is the first British national to be convicted of human trafficking crimes not involving British victims and which were not committed in the country. She said: “Since 2009 she was a British citizen which allows us therefore to use the legislation of the Modern Slavery Act. “She was a registered nurse, she was an agency nurse and that totally goes against for me what a nurse is - somebody who looks after people, who makes them better and certainly what she was doing was totally opposed to what in my mind a nurse should be.” The trafficking investigation - Operation Redroot - began after one victim was arrested and told German police of Iyamu’s crimes - who then wire-tapped the victims’ mobile phones. The prostitute last January told German police she was born into a “relatively poor family” in Nigeria and was told she could earn huge amounts of money working as a prostitute in Europe.  Ms Mellor said: In return of making those arrangements she has charged them an enormous amount of money and by working as prostitutes these would need to repay their debts. “They agreed that they wanted to travel to Europe but in order to they had to go through a Juju ceremony.” The officer explained Juju was a form of voodoo with “highly respected” priests in West Africa and added: “They exert an insidious control which an expert witness has said is more powerful than chains. The Nigerian victims visited the priest multiple times and for up to a week as part of the oath-swearing ceremony. Describing the ceremony, the officer added: “They were given blood containing worms to drink. A chicken was used to hit her naked body on the back and on the chest. “She had to eat the heart of the chicken which had just been killed. “And the priest would cut their skin and mouth with a razor blade.” Iyamu then took snippets of her victims’ head and pubic hair and kept them in individualised packages and “she told the girls, ‘You have now eaten from the devil and if you do not pay, the devil will kill you\u0027.” The victims would then undertake a “horrendous” journey across the Sahara desert from Nigeria to the Libyan coast. “During that journey the bus was shot at, hi-jacked, sometimes they had to travel across the desert on foot. “It could be up to two weeks before an inflatable boat could come to take them to Italy. The victims were moved to a migration camp in Verona before being given false identification papers allowing them to travel to Germany where brothels are legal.

The small canine was spotted apparently locked in the truck amid 27C temperatures outside the fast food restaurant on Monday.  In footage captured by a teenager, it could be seen looking upwards, with its mouth open, from inside the vehicle in Somerset. Gabrielle Dart, 17, who filmed the dog, noticed a horn repeatedly sounding while visiting the chain\u0027s Frome branch with her mum.  She raised the alarm and claims that the animal was left inside the truck for about 40 minutes in the heat, Somerset Live reports.   The teenager, who lives in Bruton, said: “We heard a car horn which kept going off and realised it was the dog honking the horn. “So I took some photos, got the manager and alerted them.” Gabrielle and the restaurant manager apparently decided to report the \u0027trapped\u0027 dog to the police, while hoping its owner quickly returned. They went indoors to call officers, but it is claimed that when the teenager next checked the car park, the truck with the dog had gone. Gabrielle posted about the incident on social media, alleging that an open crack had been left in the window of the vehicle.   She claimed on Facebook : “Hello everyone, can someone please tell me who owns this vehicle as they left there dog in there car for around 40mins in 27 degrees heat! (sic) This is unacceptable!   Do people not understand dogs are incapable of sweating. But people think this is okay because they left a crack in the window.”  Gabrielle said she believes the McDonald’s manager reported the incident to the police after she raised the alarm. Somerset Live contacted the Frome branch, but staff on duty yesterday were not aware of the incident two days earlier. Gabrielle’s photos and video of the dog come after several reports of dogs being left inside cars in the West Country.

But the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the rest of the gang are now getting ready for the next big occasion - Prince Louis\u0027s christening . The latest royal baby has been kept out of the spotlight since he was born on April 23. We got a quick look at the fifth in line to the throne as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge took him home from the Lindo Wing at St Mary\u0027s Hospital in central London. But his christening will be the first time we\u0027ve seen him in public since. Here\u0027s everything you need to know about the christening....  When and where is the christening taking place? The date to pop in your diary is July 9. The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, will take the service, which will be held at the Chapel Royal in St James’s Palace. Louis\u0027 brother George was christened at the Chapel Royal in 2013, while sister Charlotte was christened at the Church of St Mary Magdalene in Norfolk in 2015.  Why is July 9 important to the Queen? Go back 71 years and July 9 is the date her majesty, who was then Princess Elizabeth, announced she was engaged to Philip Mountbatten. Even though they were privately engaged for a year before, they didn\u0027t make it public until July 9, 1947. They made the announcement at Buckingham Palace. As is traditional in the royal family, they also released an official photo to mark the occassion. It shows Elizabeth sitting on a chair with Philip sitting on the arm, and they are staring into each others eyes looking very much in love.  The couple married later that year at Westminster Abbey and became the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. As we all remember from Prince William and Harry\u0027s engagement announcements, it\u0027s a big day for any royal so it\u0027s probably still a special day for the Queen. Her majesty is due to attended to attend Louis\u0027s christening, and it\u0027s expected that Prince Philip will be by her side despite retiring from royal duties last year.  What will Louis wear for the christening? Louis will wear a replica of the silk and lace christening gown worn by royal babies since 1841. The original was commissioned by Queen Victoria for her daughter Victoria, and was made of delicate silk and Honiton lace. But after the christening of Prince Edward\u0027s daughter Louise in 2004 it was decided that the original gown was too delicate to be worn. The Queen\u0027s dressmaker Angela Kelly made a replica which was debuted on Louise\u0027s younger brother James in 2008. The same gown was worn by Prince George and Princess Charlotte at their christenings.  Who are the godparents likely to be? Royals typically choose loads of godparents, and it is usually made up of other royals and members of the aristocracy. Louis\u0027 dad Prince William had six godparent - including former King of Greece Constantine II and Princess Alexandra, the Queen’s cousin. Prince George has seven godparents, including Earl Grosvenor, who is one of the wealthiest men on the country and another member of the Royal family, Zara Tindall. As for Louis, nothing has been announced yet, but the bookies have a few favourites. Tiggy Pettifer, Prince William and Prince Harry\u0027s former nanny, leads the pack - with Ladbrokes offering odds of 2/1. William\u0027s outgoing private secretary Miguel Head is another favourite, with odds of 5/4. "},{"url":null,"title":"pubs out beer brewing your","story":"NewsPubs out of beer?

But resourceful folk are taking matters into their own hands and brewing their own, which could cost as little as 50p a pint. Once a popular hobby in the 70s and 80s, kits were responsible for cheap booze and bad heads, as well as the odd garage explosion and some vinegary concoctions. Now the craze is back, spurred by the boom in craft breweries, with 35 million Google searches on the subject just before England took on Belgium. So, how do you go about making your own? Here we get advice from the experts as well as tell you what you need, how to do it and where to get help...  THE PROCESS “Anyone can brew, but a brewer can brew the same beer twice,” says Chris Bingham, of Binghams Brewery in Twyford, Berkshire. He started home-brewing at the age of 18. Now, 25 years later, he is the palate behind Binghams Vanilla Stout, holder of the prestigious CAMRA Supreme Champion Beer of Britain title. With that in mind, always follow the instructions, write everything down and sterilise anything that comes into contact with the wort. Measure out the different types of roasted barleys following a “brew sheet” – the beermaker’s equivalent of a cookbook recipe.  From here the barley is steeped (“mashed” is the technical term) in warm water in one tub, then the liquid is funnelled to a second tub. Here it gets vigorously boiled with a bag of hops. The ensuing wort is cooled rapidly then transferred to yet another pot, where yeast is added and where alcohol is born. It’s a labour-intensive process and a lot to take in, so it may be worth getting a kit with pre-weighed ingredients where you just have to add hot water to syrup, wait for it to cool down, and then add yeast. It will also only make small amounts – you won’t have to hide 40 pints under your bed – and you can try out more varieties.  THE HOME BREW KITS Set up by Posy Parson and Claire Russell, Home Brewtique (homebrewtique) helps beer-lovers make brewery-quality ale from scratch in their own homes. Posy says: “We created a brew-in-a-bag method so that you can make your beer in one large pot on your stove top. We test each recipe for the best results and then write step-by-step instructions a novice can re-create time and again. “Anyone can use our kits – our aim is to break the stereotype that homebrewing is a relic of the 1970s and empower more people to take up the hobby. Our fermenter is only 22cm in diameter so can easily fit in any size kitchen.” Starter kits cost \u0026pound122 with new recipes from \u0026pound22. Expect to wait a month for the finished product. For something cheaper and quicker, BrewBarrel Homebrew Kit costs \u0026pound39.99 from Amazon and offers a choice of lager, wheat beer, IPA or Oktoberfest. All you have to do is mix the ingredients with five litres of water, leave at a set temperature for five days, then a couple more in the fridge. What could possibly go wrong? 1) Practice good sanitation. Clean. Clean. Clean. 2) Start with a simple recipe to help learn the process. 3) Brew with a friend - an extra pair of hands always helps and you can enjoy a few beers afterwards. 4) Keep ingredients cool and in air tight containers - fresh is best. 5) Share your brews with a local brewery for feedback and to learn how to improve - plus brewers are good people to"},{"url":null,"title":"royal supporters slam lady colin","story":"NewsRoyal supporters slam Lady Colin Campbell over claims about Queen’s first night as Prince Philip’s brideHer new book, The Queen’s Marriage, was branded “tawdry” over supposed revelations by servants about the monarch’s love life\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAshleigh Rainbird22:35, 28 JUN 2018Updated22:42, 28 JUN 2018NewsPrince Philip and the Queen when they were younger (Image: Hulton Royals Collection)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoyal supporters last night hit back at Lady Colin Campbell after she made claims about the Queen’s first night as Prince Philip’s bride. Her new book was branded “tawdry” over supposed revelations by servants about the monarch’s love life. Lady Colin also came under fire for writing about 97-year-old Philip’s health. The former I’m a Celebrity star claims royal staff spilled intimate details of the Queen and her husband’s first night together at their retreat in Broadlands, Hampshire. She also alleges the monarch was left devastated after the late Princess Margaret spread rumours about Philip having affairs. The claims, in her book The Queen’s Marriage and which we have chosen not to reveal in full, sparked fury.  Former BBC Royal \u0026shyCorrespondent Jennie Bond said: “I don’t see any need to discuss the Queen’s love life and marriage. “It’s distasteful, unnecessary and tawdry.” Ex-royal butler Paul Burrell added: “Anyone can make up these claims. You can only be a true, \u0026shyreliable witness to history if you are there. Lady Colin Campbell was none of those things. She is writing about our Head of State, our Head of Church and someone who she does not know. She is writing about someone who she is not familiar with. “I stood beside her and lived with her for 11 years and I can tell you who the Queen is. She is a good, kind Christian lady and she should not be defiled in this way because she is above that. “She has earned our respect as a nation and things like that should not be written.”  Speaking about Philip’s health concerns, Burrell said: “It’s none of her business. She shouldn’t be writing about his medical records, that’s \u0026shyunethical and wrong. “It’s out of bounds and off-limits. It shouldn’t be in the public domain.” Lady Campbell – who wrote a shocking biography about Princess Diana – claimed the servants were “full of talk” about the Queen and her husband’s bedroom antics after their wedding in November 1947. The 68-year-old alleges the duke confided in friend and best man David Michael Mountbatten about their night together. It is said he told another cousin the Queen was “beautiful”. Lady Campbell claims Philip spoke about his health problems during a party two years ago.

Tony Hunter, of Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, said “significant improvements” had been made. But he warned the fire could flare up again and a good downpour was needed to dampen down the vegetation. No rain is forecast as the heatwave continues. The fire destroyed four square miles of moorland and blanketed a vast area in smoke.  Residents evacuated from their homes on Tuesday have all now returned, but some have reported bleeding noses, eye irritation and chest problems. Dr Richard Bircher, of Lockside Medical Centre in Stalybridge, said: “Thankfully, the smoke is getting less, but the advice is to try to avoid it.” Mr Crowther said he was suffering chest problems after spending almost 48 hours trying to tackle the blaze.

But sadly, life keeps getting in the way and we\u0027ve spent the heatwave sitting in hot and stuffy classrooms or offices.  But one school in Derby has come up with an unusual idea to help their kids deal with the heat - scrapping school uniform, reports Derbyshire Live .  Pupils at West Park School in Spondon has been told they can wear their PE kids instead of their formal uniform.  Temperatures in the area have reached 28 degrees, and staff hope the change in policy will ensure kids can continue learning. Teachers have also been allowed to dress down in the heat, and head teacher Brian Walker has gone tie-less for the first time in 45 years. Brian, who came up with the idea, said: The weather we have experienced is extraordinarily hot and, as this is an old building, on some days it is not as cool as many modern day air-conditioned buildings. Therefore, we are doing everything we can to ensure that our pupils have the best learning environment possible. While the children are at school, we want to care for them.   How hot does it have to get at work before you can stop and go home? Law and your rights explained  If you walk around the school classrooms now, you can hear the hum of learning as you would do on any normal day at school. The normal uniform consists of a white polo shirt and dark-coloured shoes, with black trousers for boys and a choice of either a black skirt or trousers for girls. Children at the school are loving the idea, and are very grateful for the cooler clothing option. Matty Ferguson, 12, said: I think it is a really good idea and has really helped me keep cool. The weather has been really nice over the last few days, but we were getting hot and bothered at school and wearing the PE kits have made it much easier to do our work in lesson.

With the Queen among those suffering from a summer cold - which can be mistaken for hayfever - here are some of the things you should be looking out for. The monarch was forced to miss a service at St Paul\u0027s Cathedral because she is feeling \u0027under the weather\u0027. This is despite the UK baking in temperatures up to 31.9C, with the heatwave set to continue into the weekend. These are some of the things you should know about summer colds, and most importantly how they should be treated.  Is a summer cold the same as a winter cold? Not quite. Although they have similar symptoms, a summer cold is more likely to be caused by the cold virus, enterovirus, which prefers the milder conditions of summer. During the winter it is usually rhinovirus, which is more prevalent when it is cold. The winter version is characterised by being severe but short-lived, while in the summer it will more often linger, and also has a habit of recurring. What are the symptoms of a summer cold? Summer colds are often mistaken for hay fever . A runny nose, sneezing, cough, congestion and sore throat are common ailments, as in the winter, along with a raised temperature, aching joints and tiredness.

BBC staffer Louisa Lewis says the clips popping up on her Swann Security mobile app showed a kitchen she didn\u0027t recognise and people she didn\u0027t know. The videos showed a man and woman walking by and captured a child\u0027s voice in the background. The incident has sparked privacy concerns about smart security cameras, but Swann Security insists factory and human error were to blame for the data breach and it was a one-off incident. But it was the second incident to occur in as many months. In May, another customer told how video from a pub\u0027s CCTV system was sent to his mobile app by mistake.  The system is designed to send camera footage to an app on a customer\u0027s mobile phone when motion is detected. Notifications pop up on the phone to alert the customer. The videos sent to Ms Lewis automatically downloaded onto her phone and she said the images kept coming even though she had complained to Swann after the initial batch arrived on Saturday. She was told nothing could be done until after the weekend, and they didn\u0027t stop until a BBC journalist contacted a public relations firm which represents Swann on Monday.  Ms Lewis told the BBC: I was out and I had a couple of alerts.  Naturally, I looked at my phone only to see the video was not of my home. At first I ignored it - I thought it must be an error - then I had several other alerts, at which point I thought I had better get in touch with Swann.  She said the clips were mistakenly sent to her phone after her camera\u0027s battery died and was recharged. The family in the videos has not been identified. A spokesperson for Swann, owned by US-based security camera firm Infinova Group, told : Swann takes the security and privacy of our customers very seriously. We are taking corrective action and further investigating this issue as our highest priority. A spokesperson told the BBC that the cameras belonging to Ms Lewis and the family had the same bank-grade security key, and the family ignored a warning message saying the camera was already paired to an account when they linked it to their network. The spokesperson claimed it was a one-off.

Shedloads of cash, a 9,000-acre country estate, a six-storey town house, two ocean-going yachts, 80 servants, an adoring wife, and an exotic French mistress. When it came to making money – and spending it – there has never been anyone to touch Whitaker Wright. He made today’s oligarchs, dot millionaires and oil-rich sheikhs look tame by comparison. His mansion boasted a theatre, a vast palm house, an observatory with a revolving copper roof and Britain’s first private velodrome. His proudest embellishment was a glass underwater smoking room, sitting like a giant igloo at the bottom of a lake. On both sides of the Atlantic he was portrayed as a god-like figure dextrously pulling the strings in a dazzling puppet show of high finance. Yet this larger-than-life tycoon ended up swallowing cyanide and dying in agony on a basement floor.  Wright’s tale has intrigued me ever since I visited his underwater hideaway – still intact and watertight after 120 years – while researching architectural follies. What kind of man would build such a place, I wondered? The answer, it turned out, was an out-and-out rogue whom the \u0026shyVictorians called the Napoleon of Finance, and whose riveting and adventurous life is the subject of my new biography, Ultimate Folly. Born in Stafford in 1846, Wright was the son of a poor Methodist minister. He went briefly into the church himself but quickly realised it would never make him rich. Crossing the Atlantic, he prospected for gold and silver in the Rockies. Life was tough and dangerous. In Idaho he was the sole survivor of a Native American massacre. With a nose for a good deal, he began buying up mines and floating them on the stock exchanges. He was a persuasive salesman and investors flocked to buy shares in his companies, making him a millionaire at 32.  The fact that many of his mines were duds didn’t bother him. “The people want to be skinned, and I am going to skin them,” he told a friend. He acquired a mansion in Philadelphia, a beachside holiday home, a yacht, and a 16-year-old wife, Anna. In the late 1880s his American business empire crashed, and furious creditors tried to have him jailed. Always one step ahead of the law, he fled back to England and started again. This time Australian gold was his route to riches. Floating numerous mines on the London market he became the richest man in Britain, and possibly the world. With a love of the good life, he splashed out on every conceivable luxury. At his vast Lea Park estate in Witley, Surrey, he tried to “emulate the life of the Roman emperors”, according to one observer. The mansion had 32 bedrooms and seven reception rooms \u0026shydecorated with gold leaf and priceless art treasures. It took several minutes to walk from one end of the house to another. The cedar-panelled ballroom could accommodate hundreds of dancers and boasted a pipe organ, a minstrel’s gallery and a ceiling based on the Sistine chapel in Rome. The mansion’s huge glass conservatory rivalled Kew Gardens for splendour. The sole job of one servant was to tend to Wright’s orchids.  Out in the grounds, the 600 workmen at his permanent disposal attended to his every whim. On one notorious occasion he told them to move a hill because it was blocking his view. They cut it down in slices and rebuilt it on another part of his land. Taking a fancy to a 30-ton marble dolphin’s head while in Italy, Wright shipped it to Southampton. It was too big to go through railway tunnels, so he had it hauled to his estate on a traction engine, widening the highway where necessary and digging out the road beneath bridges. He put up a palatial stable block for 50 horses, complete with central heating and an equine hospital. He had his initials WW carved in stone above the stable entrance. “The whole thing was a blatant sumptuousness which must have embarrassed the horses,” noted one critic. A team of Italian boatmen were on hand to take Wright and his pals on “journeys of adventure” across his three lakes in electric launches, sailing craft and row-boats. The first port of call was a subterranean water-filled passageway, its entranceway half-concealed by trees and shrubs in the grounds. Guests were encouraged to imagine themselves in the Blue Grotto at Capri as they floated past caves bathed in blue light.

Reservoirs dried up, water supply was cut off, schools shut and flames tore through mountains and forests. In the 1976 heatwave, camels even rode through Welsh reservoirs and children rode their bikes on empty river beds. For many people, memories of the drought that year centre around the water shortages caused by dried up reserves. But it was a summer holiday like no other for others, where public fountains became swimming pools and every day was spent at the beach.  This is the story of the summer when Wales ran dry, Wales Online reports. For a year before the big drought temperatures started to rise. The winter before, the UK received less than half of its average rainfall, while at the start of 1976 there were months which saw no rain at all. By April alarm bells started to ring - particularly for Wales\u0027 biggest industry bosses whose factories used million upon million of gallons of water each day. Every day between June 23 to July 7 the temperature in Wales reached 32.2C, with five of those days going above 35C. The hottest day of all was July 3, with temperatures topping 35.9C. With no clouds in the sky, by July 14, 1976, it was time for action.  Taking the lead Welsh National Water Development Authority announced that 400,000 people would have their water supply cut off at night. It also ordered an end to washing cars and the watering of flower beds, tennis courts, bowling greens and golf courses. A week later, Dennis Bowden, the water authority\u0027s senior civil engineer, said the country could be facing a three-day working week. The situation is critical, he said. We are doing everything we can to avoid further cuts, but people are not saving enough and the reservoirs are very low. To help cut any frivolous use of water no shortage of advice was offered to the average Welsh family. The South Wales Echo ran a front page with the headline Water - here\u0027s how YOUR family can save 632 gallons in a week, with a picture of a young family next to a sea of buckets. Suggestions included taking showers instead of baths and watering the garden with dirty dishwater. At the time it became patriotic to have a dirty car, billions of ladybirds swarmed southern England and the only way to flush a toilet was with dirty dish-wash water.  Meanwhile, the South Glamorgan area health authority took a more unusual approach by urging people to use their imagination. It said: People should pretend they are camping or visiting relatives in some part of the country not directly connected to the main water system. The smell of effluent which can\u0027t be flushed away overnight might be awful, but unless there\u0027s a bug already in the house it won\u0027t make any difference to the health situation. By August the number of houses without water at night grew to up to one million, with residents warned it could last for a horrifying 12 weeks. Schools were shut due to health concerns, with no water flowing during the 17-hour cut off period. As the start of the month headlines from the time read like a quaint British comedy.  The drought brought about the advent of the midnight gardener, with families like the Willoughbys of Radyr spotted watering their beds in the dead of night. What they were doing was perfectly legal, taking advantage of a burst main in their road. Children spent every day outside, including those who used Lido in Briton Ferry, the nickname given to a feeder canal. Despite their advice South Glamorgan Health Authority also came under fire after sprayers were spotted in use on Glossop Terrace Maternity Hospital in Cardiff, in defiance of a hosepipe ban. The authority blamed maintenance contractors. Meanwhile, river bailiffs were kept busy by poachers who took advantage of low levels on the Wye to catch salmon left lethargic by a lack of oxygen.  For business, however, it was no laughing matter. In Gwent a total of 70 companies were ordered to halve their water consumption, including coal mines and works owned by British Steel. Warnings of a vegetable famine dominated the headlines, while the National Farmers\u0027 Union described the heat as a dust bowl situation in Wales . The National Coal Board chipped in with some support in August, providing an additional three-quarters of a million gallons a day from an underground source at Llanover, near Blackwood. But it came too late for the BP Chemicals plant in Barry, where 1,800 people worked, which was forced to shut down operations after a 50% cut in supplies.

A stonking 33C was recorded in Porthmadog in Wales today, which is 1.1C hotter than yesterday\u0027s peak of 31.9C and Tuesday\u0027s 30.7C in Cheshire. And today was almost Northern Ireland\u0027s hottest day IN HISTORY as the mercury hovered around 30.5C and crept towards the 30.8C record, but didn\u0027t quite manage it. Met Office meteorologist Becky Mitchell said it is too early to tell what today\u0027s highest temperature will be, but nevertheless, it\u0027s a record-buster. It could get slightly higher [this afternoon], she said.  Forecasters expect it could get hotter still tomorrow in some areas across the UK, bringing the threat of thunder. A spokesman for the Met Office said earlier: Over the next few days the high pressure will remain so there will be blue skies across the UK and that will last certainly into the weekend.   Wednesday was the hottest day of the year so far and Scotland’s hottest day for five years. “There will be a warm start across much of Scotland and Northern Ireland. “Much of England and Wales as well, there is just some low cloud and mistiness flirting with these east coasts.  “It is not a great deal and any low cloud in land will evaporate very quickly through the morning. “The majority once again seeing a blue sky day.” The mercury rocketed to 32C in Glasgow today, while Fort William enjoyed 29C heat, Dumfries 28C and London was slightly cooler at 27C. But tomorrow the capital is expected to rocket once more to 29C as the country is expected to bask in glorious sunshine once more.

Long-suffering Amy Jackson has been ravaged by eczema since birth and has faced bullying and constant flare ups while struggling to complete everyday tasks, such as bathing. Showering can be so painful it leaves the 23-year-old crying out in pain, and she says she feels suicidal.  The disorder causes itchy and inflamed patches of skin, but for Amy, it is truly debilitating, and she is now losing her hair as a result of scalp scratching, reports Hull Live.   “Eczema affects me in so many ways – physically, emotionally and mentally , she said, opening up about her daily struggle.   “I feel absolutely helpless with it – nobody knows the skin that I’m in and I can’t walk away from the illness even for a moment. “There is no way out of it and I often think to myself, can I still be doing this in another 50 years? “I cry every single night with the pain of it and having a shower is agony as my skin is so sore. “I’m emotionally unstable as a result and my eczema completely strains my relationships with my partner and dad. Amy has faced problems with doctors before and has been in hospital many times. As a result, she said feels the condition is not properly reviewed for improvement, like other long term conditions such as diabetes. “I’ve been on steroids to manage my eczema for as long as I can remember even though they are only meant to be a short term solution, which is clear as my skin shows signs of steroid overuse.  “I’ve tried light therapy and all sorts but there is no cure for it. “I’m having to spend a lot of my wages on steroid cream and special shampoo to help with my hair loss, but I know that there are better solutions out there. Amy also thinks that there is not enough support for those suffering with eczema, and that those around her do not fully understand the extent of how serious the condition can be. “It’s so much more than just a red rash,” said Amy. “People tell me to just stop itching, but that’s impossible, as the illness is itching. At times I feel like I’m in a hole, spiralling down and down. Growing up with eczema has also been tough for Amy, as she says that other children did not understand it. “I got bullied at school because of my eczema and other kids didn’t really come near me as they thought that I was infectious, which is completely untrue, she said. “The blood from itching my skin can also ruin bedsheets, so I never got asked to sleepovers.

David Martin filmed Michelle Potter completely losing the plot last week when he challenged her to work out the puzzle at home in Catterick Garrison, North Yorkshire. Gallant David then posted the clip to social media - and is now braced for reprisals. In the video, the 29-year-old asks Michelle: “There’s 30 cows in a field and twenty ate chickens, how many didn’t?” The statement is designed to baffle listeners for having a double meaning - in this case “twenty ate” sounds like the number 28.  Hilariously Michelle, 32, is shown jumping to her feet shouting “what do you mean? You’re winding me up” as she struggles for almost five minutes to solve the riddle. Michelle, who works for construction company Carillion, then stands up, shouting at David “Right typical maths, it’s clearly something to do with maths right or you’ve just f****d it up and you’re reading it wrong. “There’s 30 cows in a field and twenty eight chickens so there’s 28 chickens and thirty cows in the field which makes that 58. How many didn’t? Two.” David responds: “You’re not listening to the question” and repeats the riddle again. At this point Michelle takes a few seconds to think and then says two again before David bursts out laughing.  She then smiles before crouching down nearby and asks David: “Okay what were they doing for them not to be doing anything?” “How many of what didn’t? Dave, tell me. 30 cows a field. Nothing wrong with that. 28 chickens...You d***.” A frustrated Michelle then starts laughing before putting her head in her hands while she sits on the ground. Michelle’s 12-year-old daughter Jessica Bostock, who is sat playing Fortnite in the room, can be heard telling the couple the correct answer of 10. But even then Michelle can’t understand why and begins shouting “How do you know it’s 10? How do you know it’s 10 when he isn’t even asking a question?” Michelle then asks “Is it about the egg? What came first?”  The clip then continues for another couple of minutes as Michelle gets more and more frustrated with David. At one point, Michelle grabs a plastic cup and plastic gun toy and throws it at her wind-up boyfriend saying: “You’re just trying to be a k***head. Trying to make me look like a f****** r****d.” Jessica explains the riddle to Michelle but she still struggles to understand it because David “didn’t even mention the cows eating the chickens”. The clip ends with Michelle repeating the riddle over and over trying to work it out. Speaking today, David, a store manager at Greggs, said: “I think I’ve started something.

The fundamentally new approach overcomes critical shortcomings of previous attempts.  It offers hope of securing data transmitted over fibre optic lines, thwarting eavesdroppers, and improving technologies for sensing, telecommunications and information processing. The concept, theoretically, could also be extended to make 3D objects invisible from all directions, said the researchers. The spectral cloak operates by selectively transferring energy between certain colours of the light wave.  After the wave has passed through the object, the device restores the light to its original state. When viewing an object, what you are really seeing is the way in which it modifies the energy of the light waves that interact with it. Luis Romero Cortes, a student in the lab who specialises in quantum optics, explained: Conventional cloaking solutions rely on altering the propagation path of the illumination around the object to be concealed. This way, different colours take different amounts of time to traverse the cloak, resulting in easily detectable distortion that gives away the presence of the cloak. Our proposed solution avoids this problem by allowing the wave to propagate through the target object, rather than around it, while still avoiding any interaction between the wave and the object. The study, published in the journal Optica, used a technique that rearranged different colours of broadband light so the wave propagates through the object without actually \u0027seeing\u0027 it. To do this, the spectral cloak first shifts the colours toward regions of the spectrum that will not be affected by propagation through the object. For example, if the object reflects green light, then light in the green range might be shifted to blue - so there would be no green light for it to reflect. Then, once the wave has cleared the object, the cloaking device reverses the shift, reconstructing the wave in its original state. The team demonstrated their approach by concealing an optical filter, a device that selectively transmits different wavelengths of light, after illuminating it with a laser.

But he was a bit of a lost soul with all the tragedy in his life. A lost soul, but a kind soul.”Former Craigie High School pupil Gary, who was a gardener, was laid to rest next to his brother and dad at Birkhill Cemetery following a service in the Hilltown.Mhairi said the police had alerted them that he was unwell but the family weren’t initially told how serious a condition he was in.She said: “The CID came to us about 3am on the Thursday. They told us at that point he was ill in Perth Royal Infirmary.“I had problems with my phone but when I got through to the hospital they told us how serious it was and to grab anyone close to him and to get there. We were told he wasn’t going to make it.”Mhairi said with no brain activity detected, medics told the family there was nothing they could do for him. His life support was switched off at 10.30am.She said: “I had to leave before they turned the machine off – I couldn’t be there for that. I said my goodbyes and Peter and I left.“We have been told it was a cardiac arrest, but they don’t know if there were drugs or something else involved. We have to wait for the toxicology report and then a fatal accident inquiry.”She added: “Gary never really got over Chicky dying. He never understood him leaving him like that, I don’t think.\u0026#8220I’ll remember his cheeky smile, especially when he was lying to you. He knew you knew he was lying and that would always bring a smile to his face. He knew how to make you laugh and would do anything for you.“Gary was bubbly, outgoing, really helpful. And he liked to party with his friends.“A lot of people will be lost without him. Loads of people have got in touch since he died.“There are tributes on Facebook from his pals but I haven’t watched the videos people have shared. I’m not ready to hear his voice again, yet.”Peter, 35, said: “Gary liked his young life, spending time with his friends. I had known him all his life with him being my cousin.“He was a troubled soul because he lost his family. He did some daft stuff but he had a heart of gold. You could make him happy short-term, but long-term, he had lost too much.“He never really got over his brother’s death, he couldn’t make sense of it. He loved being out working, outdoors, gardening, doing cladding, things like that.“It was obviously very emotional when he died.

He even used to come in to do the dishes for us.“Everyone knows him from the cash and carry to the bank everyone knows who he is.“We also couldn’t do it without Iona Carlin, one of our staff, she has been with us three years and we are all just like a big family now.”n At Dundee and Angus College there is a range of courses on offer for would-be chefs with SVQ levels two and three in professional cookery available.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people local girl amelie 8 cleaning up business with her own soap making company","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA young entrepreneur is cleaning up in business – at the age of eight!Amelia Milton has started her own soap making company and, despite the fact her business Smelleez has only been running for just over six months, her wares are already proving very popular with customers in and around the Perth area where she lives.Her mum Margaret said: “It was Amelia’s decision to start the business.“Not only does she make the soap but she also chooses the ingredients, the colours and the packaging and she also designed the logo and strapline as well as selling the products.“She began the business just before Christmas and things are going well.“Her latest sales were at the youth festival event in Perth at the weekend.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2cf8557f688-848x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people student jim 73 gets third degree","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStudents of all ages packed out City Square as the Caird Hall hosted the  University of Dundee’s graduation ceremonies.Among those receiving a degree was 73-year-old Dundonian Jim Ashwood, who picked up his MA(Hons) in American History.Lifelong learner Jim was born on Small’s Wynd, which now forms part of the university campus itself.He said he was “absolutely chuffed” to be picking up his third degree.Hilltown mum Fiona Dixon, 47, is one of the university’s first part-time students to graduate with honours after collecting her First Class MA in English and History.Fiona said: “It’s been a brilliant experience.

armstrong cash boost from celtic transfer to southampton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United won’t get their Stuart Armstrong windfall straight away but that will not affect their summer signing programme.The Tangerines are in line to receive six figures from Celtic when Armstrong completes an expected £6 million switch to English Premier League outfit Southampton this week.It’s because of a sell-on clause from the deal when the Scottish international left Tannadice for Parkhead back at the end of January 2015.Once the £1m plus the Hoops paid for him then is deducted, the cash heading to Tannadice is likely to be between £400,000 and half a million.While that will be more than welcome as United prepare for another money-losing season in the Championship, with the player’s likely move to England coming out of the blue, it is not something they budgeted for.That means the further signings being planned will not be hit by the fact Celtic do not have to pay up straight away and, if they choose, could stagger the payments over two or three years.What the money could become is a nice extra for manager Csaba Laszlo if he makes moves in the transfer market during the January window.Right now he is looking to put the finishing touches to rebuilding a squad that’s already seen eight new first-team players fixed up.He remains in the market for another striker and a central defender, in particular.Potential target Callum Morris completed a moved to second-tier rivals Ross County at the weekend – along with former Tannadice team-mate Keith Watson.Morris was still on a list of possible signings but after securing stopper Frederic Frans earlier this month, a footballing defender is being sought.Former striker David Goodwillie could complete a move from Clyde to Premiership new boys Livingston this week if the clubs can agree a fee.United were aware of his likely availability during the close season but, given his off-field issues, there was no chance of him being handed a third spell at Tannadice.Monday saw the players start their first full week of pre-season training at their St Andrews base.They are due to see action for the first time tomorrow week in a friendly at Brechin and more games are set to be pencilled in.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/07/image.jpg@1.126288.jpg ","title":"dundee united to get six figure sum as stuart armstrong completes move from celtic to southampton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United are now guaranteed a six-figure windfall after former star Stuart Armstrong signed for Southampton.The Scotland midfielder has penned a four-year deal after completing his £7 million switch from Celtic.Under the terms of his 2015 moved from Tannadice to Parkhead, the Tangerines are due a chunk of that fee.That’s likely to see them land somewhere between £400,000 and £500,00, though the details of over what period that money comes in will have to be thrashed out with the Hoops.Armstrong’s future at Celtic Park had been in doubt after negotiations over a new contract had stalled, leaving Brendan Rodgers to cash in with just a year to run on his current deal.He was part of the side that won the ‘double treble’ under Rodgers and won a total of eight major trophies during his time at the club.He scored 17 times in 2016-17 and forced his way into the Scotland setup but struggled to replicate that form last season after an injury.Armstrong is manager Mark Hughes’ first signing of the summer window after Southampton narrowly survived relegation from the top flight of English football, and the former Stoke boss was keen to add the Scot’s creativity to a squad that scored just 37 goals last season.Hughes said: “Stuart is a player who we have admired for some time, and I am delighted we have been able to bring him here, especially given the competition we faced to sign him.“We have strong players in the squad and it is important we build on that by adding different qualities.“It is important we add a greater goal threat to the team as a whole, and to our midfield specifically, and Stuart’s record of scoring and creating makes him an extremely exciting addition in that area.“He brings with him extensive experience of European football and has developed his game impressively over the past few seasons at a major club in Celtic, where there is a demand not only to perform but also to win. Stuart has done both during his time there.”Armstrong added: “Southampton seems a really good fit for me. Watching from afar, I really enjoy the attractive football that they play and I’m very happy to be here.“Every season, I put demands on myself to create and score goals. I hope going forwards from here that it will be the same this term at St Mary’s.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b32069b78095-490x564.jpg ","title":"football is a labour of love for refreshed dundee united coach craig easton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAnyone who’s come across him down the years will testify enthusiasm has never been an issue with new Dundee United reserve team manager Craig Easton.As far back as when he was part of the youth system he’s now spearheading, Craig’s huge appetite for the game was always apparent.Even he, though, admits a spell out of the game a couple of years back was a perfect reminder of just how good life in football is.It came when financial problems at Torquay United forced him into an unexpected move back to Scotland and left him searching for work.Not content to sit around waiting for his next job, Eastie ended up working in the building trade and admits it was one of the best moves he’s ever made.“I was in England for 12 years and I didn’t even think of coming back up to Scotland to be honest,” he said.“But in football you can’t plan what’s going to happen, especially as a player and then, when I was coaching, I found things could change as well.“I was with Torquay working with the U/19s and college kids. It was my first real job in coaching and their academy was doing well but the club got relegated to the Conference and couldn’t afford to run their academy.“It’s a big outlay and, unfortunately, it folded and jobs went with it. I would have loved to have stayed, it was a great job and I had an excellent lifestyle.“The job wasn’t there so I came back up the road and there wasn’t much happening. I applied for jobs and I got close to a couple.“I ended up doing a bit of labouring and it was great, it was the best thing for me. I kept myself busy.“I was taking down cabins, near St Andrews funnily enough, and then building. I’d never had any experience of it but enjoyed it. Every day was different and the guys were brilliant. A lot of good people – I still keep in touch.“I always appreciated what I had as a footballer but sometimes you need to go out of it and get back in just to be reminded what you have.“So getting out for a bit was good, it got my appetite back without me realising I’d lost it. And just doing something different, seeing another side of life, meant I learned a lot.”His return to football came at Raith where an excellent record with the youths sparked interest from others.Determined to repay the faith Raith showed in him, he rebuffed the chance of a quick move but when United came calling he admits his affection for the place where his career started made it an offer he couldn’t refuse.“I enjoyed Raith, there were good people, a good club and it was tough to leave but I couldn’t turn this job down.“This is a big responsibility because United have produced some great players over the years. There’s a lot of good players come through and a lot of good people looked after the kids here, so there’s a lot to live up to. I was lucky to work with a lot of those people.”In recent years, the conveyor belt of young talent at Tannadice has slowed but Craig’s confident, along with assistant Scott Robertson, talent will flow.That’s in no small part because the mechanism required to produce players is still in place.“We know how important it is to keep bringing players through at this football club and there is talent here.“There is so much that goes on before us to get it to the stage where we take the players. It’s not about us, it’s about everything that goes before that to get them to the point where Scott and I take them.“Brian Grant (academy head) is on top of that and making it better all the time. It’s about us then doing the extra wee bit to take them to the first team.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b34a84839fed-845x564.jpg ","title":"medical marvels to go on display at dundee science centre","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee Science Centre’s new Medical Marvels exhibition and science learning suite will open on Monday.After several months of construction and fit-out, the redevelopment has doubled the upper floor space through a mezzanine extension.Visitors will approach the Medical Marvels exhibition through a medical curiosities wall showcasing genuine artefacts ranging from a rib scraper and glass eye inserter to 19th Century surgical toolkits.The high-tech clinical exhibition features a virtual anatomy table that allows visitors to explore the different layers of the human body.Picture shows a young medic getting up close and personal with a patient in the operating theatre.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b222ed15f5ad-847x564.jpg ","title":"more summer signings to come promises dundee gaffer mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNeil McCann is delighted with the five summer signings he’s made so far and the Dundee boss is determined more will follow.Monday saw Senegalese striker Jean Alassane Mendy fixed up on a two-year deal from Belgians Lokeren to join fellow-new boys Jack Hamilton, Nathan Ralph, Kharl Madianga and Elton Ngwatala in pre-season training.Neil felt it was import to get the bulk of his transfer business done as early as possible but his aim is to make more moves before the window slams shut at the end of August.“I hope to get one or two more in and we’ve always got targets,” said Neil.“This year we are a bit more advanced than we were this time last year and that’s good because I wanted to get a bit of business done immediately.“Now you go for ones who can probably be a wee bit more troublesome to get in but we are working hard on that and as the pre-season goes on maybe we’ll get a bit more business done.”To that end the gaffer has identified specific players and areas of the team where he wants to add more depth but will be giving nothing away on that until contracts have been signed.“I wouldn’t go into specific areas.

I said ‘if you can do it, sign’.“It’s a really good club – even if it’s the rival of my team! I’d prefer if he signed for Dundee but it’s still a good club.“United have got a good goalkeeper in him. He’s massive, really tall and his English is perfect so that won’t be a problem.“He’s good on the ball and can pass well. Even under pressure you can pass him the ball and he can deal with it, he’s calm and experienced. He’s dominant in the box, too, and comes for crosses.“At Vaduz there were two goalkeepers and they switched all the time but I really enjoyed playing when Benjamin was in goal.”Konrad is considering offers from Holland and Germany but says he’d be happy to return to Scotland.“I would go back to Scotland, I really enjoyed my two years there, though I’ve not had any options there. If there was a good offer I would go back.“A year ago at Vaduz we were relegated and weren’t able to go back up last campaign.“We had a poor start to the season with basically a new team. You could compare it to Dundee United’s season in the Championship. There was one team that had a good start and just kept winning.“It was nice in Vaduz, a good place to play. I can’t compare it to Scotland, though.“The fans in Dundee were mad for football and the stadiums were great. I don’t know if the fans in Vaduz and Switzerland don’t like football much but it isn’t the No 1 sport and it was really calm in the stadiums.”That’s something he couldn’t say about derby days in Dundee – some of his best memories of his time at Dens Park.“I had the two best years of my career at Dundee.“The derby win after 10 or 11 years and beating them at home was great.“The first game at Celtic Park was also a good memory. It is a really famous stadium, even in Germany.“All the derby wins were really good experiences and I feel really proud to have been a part of those games.“I like the rivalry in Dundee.

If I was there I would have been wiped out.“It’s awful the damage that’s been done.”One motorist said the car was “totalled” and added: “The car has gone straight into the wall – you could see skid marks near to where the car appeared to lose control.“This area can be extremely busy so I’d imagine this would have caused a fair bit of chaos.”A spokesman for Police Scotland said: “Police Scotland is appealing for information about a number of linked incidents which happened in the Menzieshill area.“Firstly, a silver Peugeot 106 was stolen from outside an address in Sutherland Crescent sometime after 9.45pm on Wednesday. Secondly, a parked car was damaged in a hit-and-run collision in Forth Crescent at 7am on Thursday.“Finally, the stolen car was involved in a collision with a wall in Mallaig Avenue about 7.05am on Thursday.“The driver, described as in his late teens and wearing a black hoodie, was seen to run off from the scene in the direction of South Road. He has still to be traced and may need medical attention.“Given the times and proximity of the collisions, we believe the stolen car was involved in the Forth Crescent incident.“We would like to ask anyone who was in the area and may have seen this car, or has any information which could assist our inquiries, to contact us.”Call Police Scotland on 101, speak to any officer or call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or at crimestoppers-uk.org.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b34a8a99bbaa-e1530188327481.jpg ","title":"xplore to launch city circle bus service taking in dundees top tourist spots","story":"\t\t\t\t\tXplore Dundee plans to launch a new tourist-friendly bus route in the city centre in time for the V\u0026ampA opening its doors in September.The V\u0026ampAThe 360 “city circle” route will allow passengers to reach the city’s top attractions with ease.It will stop at the V\u0026ampA and Dundee’s new railway station entrance, before heading on to attractions such as Dundee Science Centre, Verdant Works and The McManus.It will also provide as a loop between the top end of the city centre and the Waterfront, serving city hotels and the bus station along the way.Xplore bosses hope for the circuit to be completed in 20 minutes, offering a frequent and convenient service for those who want to see all Dundee has to offer.The firm’s managing director Christine McGlasson said: “We believe this would be a real boost for the city centre and the final piece of the puzzle for the Waterfront, helping visitors to navigate the city and to connect all of the new attractions in that area with the rest of the city centre.“Dundonians have also long been crying out for a link between the travel hubs of the railway station and the bus station – we really want to provide that, and we think that now’s the time to do it.“But we can’t do it alone – we’re actively seeking partners to join us in this innovative project and we’d welcome discussions with any business or organisation which would be interested in helping us launch and shape this exciting new service for Dundee.”It’s hoped that the new 360 route will use all-electric vehicles. Xplore does not own any at the moment, but it is understood the firm will try to secure “green” funding in order to buy them.Last month, Transport Scotland announced a £1.7 million Scottish Green Bus Fund – the eighth such fund it has launched to promote the use of eco-friendly public transport. Xplore could take advantage of such an offer in order to buy new stock.Councillors were briefed on the plans by Xplore last week.City development convener Lynne Short said: “It’s really exciting. When you come in to Dundee, you see the amazing train station and the wonderful V\u0026ampA but this will give you an opportunity to go beyond those and see other places around the city.”The plans for the 360 come hot on the heels of Xplore’s announcement that it will introduce a new state-of-the-art eco-friendly fleet to the city later this year.The buses, nicknamed “Emerald”, will run on electric hybrid engines which emit fewer greenhouse gases than typical diesels, and come packed with features such as USB charging.Xplore plans to deploy them on the 22 route, which passes along the Seagate – one of the city’s air pollution hotspots.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cheeky-punter-caught-trying-to-get-served-at-beer-festival-using-little-britain-driving-licence","story":"                          A CHEEKY punter was caught trying to use this fake driving licence featuring the face of Little Britain\u0027s Andy Pipkin to get served booze at a beer festival."},{"url":null,"title":"astonishing-moment-six-year-old-produces-inch-perfect-strike-in-top-bin","story":"                          THIS is the astonishing moment a six-year-old produces an inch-perfect wonder strike while brushing up on her shooting skills in her back garden at home."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7883429.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"adorable-moment-young-boy-realises-animals-go-into-meat-and-turns-vegetarian","story":"                          THIS adorable video shows the moment a five-year-old boy realises that animals are turned into meat -

autistic people to show they are proud of who they are.She added: \"It\u0027s also a show of defiance to those who would rather we were ashamed, quiet, or forgotten.\"The group were supported by Tesco

appointed champion.After months of stinging criticism over its treatment of people with autism NHS Highland has appointed occupational therapist Arlene Johnstone to be its first head of service for learning disabilities and autism.The health board faced a storm of criticism over its decision to withdraw a \u0026pound23,000 grant for the Highland One Stop Shop (HOSS) autism support service last year and it was subsequently criticised by autism expert Dr Sue Fletcher-Watson, of Edinburgh University\u0027s Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, regarding an equality impact document that showed \"total ignorance\".Ms Johnstone says she is now keen to move on from the past, bringing a determinedly inclusive approach to her work.Acting as an advocate within the health service for autistic people and those with learning disabilities has already seen her challenging NHS colleagues drawing up policy in a range of areas to make sure their needs are properly considered.Beyond what is happening internally within the NHS she says she is also keen to reach out to partners in both the third sector and business.\"I think it is easy to say \u0027the NHS has to change\u0027 and there are things we have to change, absolutely, but there is also lots of things that have to change outside of the health service and the social care world,\" she said.Listing banks, bus companies, cafes and shopping centres as the kinds of private organisations she would like to talk to about boosting their autism-friendly credentials she added: \"I think it is crucial, because most people\u0027s quality of life is not about when they visit the GP it is when they go out with their pals socialising.\"A spokeswoman for Autism Rights Group Highland has given a cautious welcome to Ms Johnstone\u0027s

Israeli medical technology firm Insightec has had the blessing of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) which advises British health authorities.Essential tremor (ET) and similar conditions impact people\u0027s ability to perform everyday tasks due to uncontrollable shaking.Sufferers treated at St Mary\u0027s Hospital in London have experienced substantial improvement after access to the equipment, according to senior surgeons.The machine enables ultrasound waves to pass through the skull to the part of the brain responsible for the tremor.Due to the incision-less nature of focused ultrasound, there is no risk of infection and patients recover quickly.Mary Ramsay (61), a lifelong ET sufferer, has had to travel 450 miles to Newcastle \u0026ndash but for an alternative and invasive treatment. No other relevant technology was available anywhere in Scotland.Her case sparked a recent debate in the Scottish Parliament in support of her campaign for specialist equipment nearer home.She said: \"I\u0027m highly delighted.

access","story":"\u0026nbspA COALITION of disability and mobility organisations has called on Highland Council to make Inverness more accessible.The Putting Inverness Streets Ahead manifesto was launched on Thursday.Attended by charity representatives and local councillors, the call was made to make the Highland capital fit for the 21st century.The manifesto has been produced by the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in collaboration with groups including Autism Rights Group Highland, Guide Dogs Scotland and the Highland Cycle Campaign.It sets out a range of barriers it says prevents Inverness being truly accessible to all, including too many bollards of different types and heights, unfenced cafe tables and chairs spilling into pavement areas and refuse bins on narrow pavements forcing pedestrians onto the road.The coalition want the council to adopt a Street Charter which would dictate conditions to be applied to any future planning or licensing applications.RNIB Scotland campaigns manager Dr Catriona Burness said: \"For too many people our streets remain a daily obstacle course.\"We believe a Street Charter would help to enhance the quality of life for residents and, vitally, boost the reputation of Inverness as an open and welcoming tourist destination.\"As \u0026lsquoThe Gateway to the Highlands\u0026rsquo Inverness plays a pivotal role in promoting the region as an attractive place to live, work and visit.\"But a vital element for any successful 21st century Scottish city must be inclusivity \u0026ndash a city that is open and welcoming to everyone \u0026ndash and the key to inclusivity is physical accessibility.\"She added: \"A Street Charter would help to avoid entrenching flawed designs that could blemish Inverness for a generation or more.\"Brian MacKenzie of the Highland Cycle Campaign said\u0026nbsp the drive to get things right first time made good financial sense for cash-strapped local authorities.\"For example, a 2015 House of Lords report on \u0026lsquoshared spaces\u0026rsquo (where roads and pavements are levelled allowing vehicles and pedestrians to use the same area) warns that \u0026lsquocouncils are risking public safety with fashionable simplified street design\u0026rsquo and notes that \u0026lsquomore and more local authorities are forced into expensive remedial work, often restoring crossings they have themselves removed\u0026rsquo,\" he said.The manifesto states: \"A Street Charter would offer planners and consultants a template for inclusive design, potentially saving the council money by cutting down on objections to plans or completed developments.\"And it adds: \"A Street Charter would also make for a more pleasant environment for people who don\u0026rsquot have disabilities as clutter-free streets and logical street layouts would make getting around easier and more appealing.\"Highland Council introduced a new policy in April, requiring trade waste bins to be kept off city

at least 50,000 visitors a year and will cater for all abilities and age groups and aims to improve the lives of those who might be struggling.The project involves outdoor enthusiast and TV presenter Duncan McCallum, of the BBC\u0027 Adventure Show.A delighted Mr McCallum said the cash injection from SSE\u0027 Highland sustainable development fund was an important and major step towards seeing the project becoming fully funded.\"The SSE award is recognising that the Ledge will become a major sports facility which will complement the region and the city of Inverness and provide training facilities for today and future generations of climbers and adventure sports people living and visiting the region,\" he said.The project will include an indoor climbing wall with high ropes, fun climbing areas and bouldering spaces, catering for climbers of international standards as well as people whose lives could be improved from participating in the activity.News of the funding was also welcomed by Inverness Central councillor\u0026nbsp Bet McAllister.\"It is fantastic for everyone to learn new skills,\" she said.\"I am happy to support anything which is sporty. It gets people out and about.\"Cllr McAllister, who is also depute provost for Inverness, believed the centre would provide an economic boost to the region by attracting visitors wanting to use the facility.The SSE fund distributes money from onshore wind developments to support strategic projects that can deliver significant impacts in local communities.Priority projects include those which enhance education and employment or bring social or environmental benefits and help regeneration whether in landscape, biodiversity or heritage.Friday 29 Jun 2018 7:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116294.jpg","title":"Co op staff do their bit as they Step Up For Sam","story":"\u0026nbspEMPLOYEES at Co-op stores across the Highlands are cycling the North Coast 500 to raise money for an Inverness three-year-old.They will tackle the gruelling bike ride from September 9-15 and the challenge will mark the end of three months of fundraising for Sam Douglas, who suffers from an undiagnosed neurological condition which causes epilepsy and developmental delay.Their efforts are part of the Step Up For Sam campaign, which aims to fund specialist treatment and equipment for the youngster.Sam, who lives with his mum Steph, dad Kris and sister Molly, requires long and intensive courses of therapy, much of which is not available on the NHS, in order to potentially become more physically independent.He has already undergone treatment in London which has made huge improvements to his balance.Sam\u0027 family are hopeful that with further treatment, his quality of life can be improved even more.Daniel Simpson, Co-op\u0027 area manager for the north of Scotland, said: \"It\u0027 a core belief in our society that we connect with the communities we support and serve.

reputation of the museum’s event schedule was not held.Despite the cancellation, the museum will be holding a range of other events across the rest of the summer which are expected to draw big crowds.The highlight, Mike said, is going to be Grampian Motorbike Convention, which although won’t include the same speed aspect as before, will bring back the delegated machines being allowed to

to Robert Wakeham, writing in last week’s Advertiser, for his questions regarding the nesting colony and status of common gulls within the former oil depot, currently the Mid Argyll hub and museum construction site.I am happy to address these questions.Historically, this species was first named in the 1700s and thought by many to come from their association with grazing or ‘common land’ and in the more recent past the name ‘uncommon gull’ may be more apt.In the UK they are essentially restricted as a breeding species to Scotland where numbers continue to decline, with this being reflected in Argyll, principally due to predation by the American mink, as pointed out.Studies at the Lingerton landfill site have shown that, unlike the larger gull species at the tip, Common Gulls do not scavenge there, as was perhaps claimed, but use the tidal mud flats of Loch Gilp and surrounding fields to find invertebrates, fish and vegetarian foodstuffs. As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 1 2018","story":"\t\tHannah O\u0027HanlonUpdated: 30/05/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere are certain moments that just simply enchant us.One such moment happened this week when we were holidaying in Dunkeld.Almost every day we visited the wildlife centre at the Loch of the Lowes and delighted in our times watching the osprey.From the webcam we could see every detail.We watched with great anticipation to see when the chicks would emerge from their eggs, of which there were three.One of the days we went to the centre there was great excitement as one of the eggs was about to hatch.The staff there are dedicated volunteers who love sharing their knowledge of these wonderful birds.To our total delight we witnessed the birth first-hand as the shell cracked open and out struggled a tiny little chick as the mother bird looked on anxiously.I could hardly believe that this tiny scrap of life would be strong enough to fly to Africa in just a few months.Shortly, the father bird arrived with a very large fish and I was amazed at the tenderness of this great strong bird as he gently fed his baby.Since then we have been \u0026#8216hooked\u0026#8217 as we follow this wee family at the beginning of their journey of life.Soon the chicks will be given flying and fishing lessons and will leave the safety of the nest.My prayer is that they will all safely complete their long journey to Africa and that they will come back next year to enchant people once again.When they go, sometime in September, I fear that I will suffer from \u0026#8217empty nest syndrome\u0026#8217 till they come back again next spring.Scripture tells us: \u0026#8216Seek information from the birds of the air.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 22","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 31/05/18, 11:50 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.CalMac management’s shocking handling of our ferry service is taking its toll on local businesses which depend on Islay’s growing tourist trade.We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.Also, I have been unimpressed with our roads department management’s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from residents and myself about the potholes across Islay.Councillor Alastair Redman, IslaySir,I\u0026#8217m inviting your readers to get their walking boots or trainers on for the Stroke Association and sign up to the summer marathon challenge, Walk Your Way.In April 2013, a year after my own stroke, I took on​ the London Marathon.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

There is also a small fee to be paid by each exhibitor for every painting or photo that is hung, and this goes to help to cover running expenses.With over 500 people having visited the exhibition in 2017, organisers hope this excellent support from the community will continue. Both professional and amateur artists in the area are encouraged to make use of the exhibition to display their work.The overriding aim of the exhibition, since its beginning in 1967, has always been to foster interest in locally-produced art and to give people from the community the opportunity to let others see, appreciate, and maybe buy their works.Organisers wish to thank the Army Cadet Force for permission to use their building.Details about how to enter exhibits will appear in adverts in the Argyllshire Advertiser, Facebook and on the exhibition website.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This is the same distance Mark averaged every day during his epic cycle round the world in 80 days last year.In other words the team of 80 intrepid cyclists will pedal the equivalent of Mark’s incredible feat – taking them around the world in a day.Participants are asked to raise a minimum of £240 each for the STV Children’s Appeal, which supports children and young people affected by poverty in Scotland, with the hope of raising as much as £80,000 for the charity.Mark said: \u0026#8216This stunning route from Argyll to Aberdeen was my last 16-hour training ride before I set out on the world challenge and it holds fond memories \u0026#8211 but it is very long and very hilly, so I’ll be impressed by everyone who signs up for this epic day of endurance.\u0026#8216The STV Children’s Appeal has gone from strength from strength, supporting so many brilliant charities and causes across Scotland.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Sheryl is a Lochgilphead woman \u0026#8211 middle-aged, celibate without choice and with plummeting self-confidence and a loathing for her body shape.

Road users will be sent on the usual lengthy diversion via the A819, A85 and the A82, though access will be maintained  for emergency vehicles.Following completion of the surfacing, further minor construction works to complete the project will take place ahead of the A83 opening to both lanes again later in July.Eddie Ross, of trunk road management company BEAR Scotland, said: \u0026#8216We thank motorists and the local community for their continued patience while teams work to complete the project.\u0026#8217The Strone Point project was projected to take 28 weeks to complete.

Collapsing ceilings and water leakage have led to a further deterioration in the fabric of the Victorian pile.  Now it is understood South Ayrshire Council bosses want to step in before it is too late. It is believed a last minute paper may go before councillors at full council in County Buildings on Thursday. The paper would ask politicians to approve the repair work. The council slapped a Dangerous Building Notice on the hotel in March, which gave the owners 21 days to respond. There are fears Ayr train station could end up shut if no action is taken. And it has been slammed a risk to the public. The Post revealed earlier this month how the hotel has been bought by new Malaysian owners from Eng Huat Ung.  Station Hotel Action Group founder Esther Clark believes the hotel could be turned into a community centre and accomodation. She said it should be “split up and dispersed” but must generate an income. She has uncovered research, which reveals the hotel was built to a “high standard” with luxurious materials. One idea mooted by Ayr Renaissance is for a part of the building to be demolished and a new train station built. Others folk have called for the council to adopt the landmark for offices. It was hoped a big hotel group would step in and carry out refurbishment but it has failed to attract interest so far. Network Rail carried out scaffolding work on the building to safeguard the operation of the station and line in 2015. The hotel, a Grade 2 listed building, has remained shut since it closed suddenly in 2013. Glasgow and South-Western Railway Company built the hotel, designed in the style of a French chateau, at a cost of \u0026pound50,000.

It is the latest diversification at Corton Farm, just outside Ayr. Customers can buy a litre glass bottle for \u0026pound2 and use it again and again at the milk machine. And farmer Alison Kerr said: “You cannot get any fresher. “We’re really hoping it catches on so we can sell more and more directly to local people.” The Kerrs – five generations at Corton since 1925 – have constructed The Milk Hoose and the Milkbot vending machines providing “untampered, non-homogenised” milk from the Corton herd.  Customers on Friday gushed praise on the creamy taste, saying it is nothing like mass-produced products. The Kerrs are charging \u0026pound1.50 per litre and say it cuts out plastic waste from supermarket bottles. Although it is more expensive than supermarket pricing, they say their milk compares favourably to speciality gold top products. Willie and Alison, both 46, have been joined working the farm by son David,19, and are being helped by daughter Joanne,16, when she is not at Belmont Academy. Willie said: “It would be a dream to sell every litre we produce right here. “But we have had a great start and it has been so well received.” The farm produces between 5000 and 6000 litres of milk a day, depending on the time of year.  That is courtesy of the 220 Friesian-Holstein milkers. The Kerrs own 260 acres and rent another 250. Fourteen years ago they expanded into the Corton Plants nursery and 14 months ago the Coo Shed coffee shop. But Alison said: “The Milkbot really completes the story of selling your own product. “We siphon off what we need into churns to be pasteurised and it is put into the Milkbot. “I guarantee it tastes completely different as all the fats and proteins have not been stripped out. “It is non-homogenised and the cream settles on top like the the old-fashioned milk.” At the moment it is thought only three farms in Scotland are selling direct via a vending machine.  Alison added: “People now are so detached from where the food comes from and I think supermarkets are to blame for that. “Some kids think milk comes from a bottle in a supermarket. “Plastic has just become a huge issue and it has been good timing for us. “People are loving our branded glass bottles.” Peak time for the new vended milk is between 5pm and 7pm and there can be 20 cars in the car park at a time with people leaving work keen to top up their supply. Alison added: “Hopefully this continues to grow. Milk is sold too cheaply in supermarkets and farmers have been down-trodden for a long time. “We have just had to take what we can get and be paid sub-30p a litre. At the moment the Milkbot is doing a couple of hundred litres a day so we have a long way to go to reach 5000 a day.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"holiday goer caused ruckus prestwick","story":"NewsHoliday-goer caused ruckus at Prestwick AirportIan Graham acted in an aggressive and intimidating manner towards Steven Ringtoul, and made threats of violence in the presence of children.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post16:00, 28 JUN 2018NewsAyr Sheriff Court (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA holidaygoer who caused a ruckus at Prestwick Airport has been fined.

And one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become. Her impact was deep, her reach was far. “Vanessa would wonder why everyone was here for her,” said dad Chris. “That’s just the kind of person she was.” Friends, family, school pals and members of the community all touched by Vanessa’s courage joined for the special service.  Her battle with neuroblastoma had been one that ensured she will never be forgotten by all lucky enough to know her. Speaking to more than 400 people at her memorial service, Chris said: “She lit up our world. “And in her short life, she packed in so much happiness. “Vanessa was a thrillseeker with a soft side – great with old and young alike. “She had the Midas touch.” And he added: “No words can describe how utterly proud we are to have been your father, mother and sister.  “This is not the end for you, you have now moved on to something new.” The emotional speech came as the Town Hall paid tribute to Vanessa, of Loans, who lost her brave battle just days short of her 18th birthday. Some of Vanessa’s closest childhood friends took their feet to recount memories of happy times of the girl with a smile for everyone. And Vanessa’s infamous parking skills and ability to make everyone laugh were just two of the themes to strike a chord. Graham Hobson, deputy head at Marr College, was another to speak warmly of an immensely popular pupil. Chris said afterwards: “I thought the speeches were great, especially Vanessa’s friends, who at only 18 spoke so eloquently and passionately about Vanessa - they belied their age doing this.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mainstreet-marks-a-decade-in-the-borders-with-makars-and-cake","story":"IF one Borders business deserves a celebration to mark a decade of business it\u0027s Mainstreet Trading.\nThe St Boswells bookshop and cafe opened at the height of the recession in June, 2008.\nAnd the pet project of Bill and Rosamund de la Hey also faced the sudden growth of ebooks as well as the emergence of online retailer Amazon.\nBut the couple, who had forged successful careers within the publishing industry in London, didn\u0027t just survive - they thrived.\nOver the past 10 years Mainstreet Trading has scooped several national awards, including both the UK Independent Bookseller of the Year and the Scottish Borders Independent Retailer of the Year.\nSix years ago there was even an expansion with the opening of Mainstreet Deli and Home in neighbouring buildings.\nAnd now the successful enterprise employs a total of 26 people.\nAhead of this Saturday\u0027s 10th birthday party, Mainstreet has launched a year-long campaign of selecting a favourite book from each of the past 10 years, producing a range of 10th birthday illustrated merchandise, and also running a Summer Reading Diary competition, giving local children the chance to win their height in books.\nRosamund and Bill have also announced that celebrated authors Sir Michael Morpurgo and Maggie O\u0026rsquoFarrell have been appointed as Mainstreet Makars to represent the children\u0026rsquos and adult book world, respectively.\nMichael is delighted with his appointment.

InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people. How do they top that?\nThey also love weddings and travelled to Dublin in 2016 to sing at the wedding of a choir member\u0026rsquos son.

This, in turn, led to a performance at a very prestigious charity dinner in aid of breast cancer.\nTo celebrate its 10th birthday, the choir will be travelling to Barcelona in October for a long weekend of performances.\nBut before that they have a bit of a party planned in Peebles.\nOn September 1, the actual birthday weekend, they have organised their \u0026lsquoTen out of Ten\u0026rsquo day - when they will sing throughout the day from a list of at least ten different favourite songs, at ten different locations in Peebles.\nAlthough the earlier locations have yet to be revealed the finale will take place at the Eastgate Theatre, where it all started ten years ago, for an evening concert.\nThis will also be the final event of the 2018 Creative Peebles Festival.\nThe choir hopes you will join them or, at least, come and say hello.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"united-front-to-boost-the-borderlands","story":"HUNDREDS of stakeholders had their say on proposals to transform the Borderlands economy at a special conference in Dumfries on Monday.\nLeader of Dumfries and Galloway Council, Elaine Murray, welcomed more than 370 business representatives, public sector organisations and individuals to the first Borderlands conference.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoI am delighted that so many people attended on the day, this shows what an important project the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal is.\n\"One attendee described the conference as an \u0026lsquoIlluminating and fantastic event\u0026rsquo, which reflected the enthusiasm I perceived on the day, that this is a once in a generation opportunity which must be seized.\nFive local authorities from north and south of the border are working in partnership to put together a proposal that should have huge implications for those who live, work and visit the area.\nIt was the first opportunity for interested parties to hear about the themes that are being developed to underpin the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal \u0026ndash and to give their views on the major projects they believe would kickstart transformation.\nThe conference was held at a key time for the partnership, made up of Carlisle City, Cumbria County, Dumfries and Galloway, Northumberland County and Scottish Borders Councils.\nResponses from the conference will help the partnership to build a case to present to both the UK and Scottish Governments later this year. Views were sought on the Borderlands\u0026rsquo key themes: Digital Energy Destination Borderlands Rural Productivity Business Growth Transport Innovation and Skills and Quality of Place.\nThe conference had backing from both governments who have pledged support for a deal.\nKeith Brown MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work, said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government has made clear our support for a proposed Borderlands deal in our budget statements. And we look forward to negotiating the detail of that deal when the partners are ready with their proposals. This is a key part of our commitment to 100 percent coverage of deals across Scotland.\n\u0026ldquoWe want to see an ambitious deal that focuses on driving inclusive growth and the priorities that will make a difference and help the economy thrive. We want a deal that helps address the area\u0026rsquos connectivity challenges, supports growth in sectors particularly important in the Borderlands, and creates more opportunities for all to attract people to the area.\n\u0026ldquoWe are working to tackle the economic challenges in the South of Scotland, having already committed to establishing a South of Scotland enterprise agency, and we want to ensure that priorities align to maximise impact and success.\nSpeaking ahead of the conference the Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell said:\n\"The Borderlands Growth Deal represents a unique opportunity to provide a real shot in the arm to the economy of our region, a region that faces similar challenges wherever you live or work within it.\n\u0026ldquoWorking with the proposals that have been prepared by local authorities, businesses and individuals, we will spend the summer shaping these in to a coherent deal that will support the economy of the region by encouraging people to invest in new opportunities, by building on our strengths and improving the lives of those who live here.\n\u0026ldquoIn that way, we will bring to the Borderlands the benefits that are now being seen across the UK as investment in City and Growth Deals progresses.\nDumfries and Galloway Council Chief Executive Gavin Stevenson said: \u0026ldquoCrucially we now sit between the emerging powerhouses of the central belt of Scotland and the Northern Powerhouse in England. Unless we act they will continue to suck up our young talent and skills.\n\u0026ldquoWe need to re-position ourselves, we need to stabilise and to stop our productivity falling and then we also need to reinvent. This feels like a once in a generation opportunity.\n\u0026ldquoWe know our potential, our children will not forgive us if there are no jobs in the future. I think we are at that point where we either put up or shut up. We get out there, we shout, we demand and we create the business opportunities.\nThose attending quizzed a panel, chaired by the UK Government\u0026rsquos Borderlands champion John Stevenson MP, on how the deal could support inclusivity, tourism projects and benefit small rural communities.\nFor more information visit the partnership website www.Borderlandsgrowth or email info@borderlandsgrowth\n"},{"url":null,"title":"youngsters-make-a-splash-at-braw-lads-swimming-gala","story":"SPECTATORS crammed into Galashiels Swimming Pool on Tuesday night for the Braw Lads\u0027 Swimming Gala.\nBraw Lad Greg Kelly, Braw Lass Kimberley O\u0027May and their attendants were given a rousing welcome as they came to support the young competitors.\nAnd the swimmers from all age groups put on a fantastic display throughout the evening, which culminated with the mixed aged group Braw Lads\u0027 Relay Race.\nThis event didn\u0027t disappoint.

Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity. The gas works at Eshiels became part of the national system and continued in operation until the advent of North Sea gas in the late 1960s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"were-so-proud-of-him-parents-of-galashiels-scout-with-adhd-hope-to-inspire-others-to-join-group","story":"THE parents of a Galashiels Scout with ADHD hope others will be inspired after the youngster won a prestigious award.\nAfter weeks of working hard to complete an array of challenges and tasks, Blair Valentine took home the Reiver Award at the Gala Scout Group annual general meeting last month.\nThe 10-year-old, who attends St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School in Galashiels, received the award in recognition of his hard work after being nominated by numerous members of the Scouts.\nProud parents Dave and Mandy now hope their son\u0026rsquos success story will inspire other parents of children with ADHD.\nThe youngster was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in July 2013 at the age of six.\nBlair\u0026rsquos mum Mandy told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore so proud of him, Blair has worked very hard to get where he is, and we want others to know that just because a child has ADHD, it shouldn\u0026rsquot hold them back from going on to do great things.\n\u0026ldquoBlair gets especially inspired when hearing that celebrities have the same condition as him.\n\u0026ldquoUntil we looked into it, we had no idea just how many well-known people were also affected by it.

SS took his portion of fish after his family were fed and satisfied.\nLater that same day, SS returned with more fish and he was certainly making up for lost time.\nHe began to feed the youngsters himself while Mrs O was preening. The chicks were visibly stronger and more energised than the day before when they were hungry.\nAfter the first chick was full it lay down on its side while the other chick fed and when it had had enough to eat, chick number one would get up and come back over for seconds.\nThe week progressed into warm weather and scorching sunshine and the chicks ranged from being sleepy and still, to being far too adventurous, toddling about the nest using their budding wings as little stilts to enable them to clamber around.\nThese little excursions led them to venture too far to the edges and the parent birds used distraction with fish to bring them away and back into the middle.\nThey also began to pay more attention to the nest construction, by moving sticks around and building up the edges, like little safety barriers to prevent any toppling over the edge.\nSadly, for one osprey family in the Borders, two chicks did fall to their death from the nest during the recent high winds.\nBut the attentive Mrs O and SS seem to have metaphorically red taped the danger zone by building stick walls just high enough to prevent any earnest climbing from a curious young osprey wanting to peer over the side.\nvar panels = panels || []var panel = {    name: \u0027RelatedArticles\u0027,    target: \u0027related-articles\u0027,    params: {ns: \u0027redesign\u0027, \u0027article_ids\u0027: \u002716322601,16322553,16321574,16320757,16320674\u0027, \u0027more_articles_heading\u0027: \u0027More articles\u0027}}panels.push(panel)\nBy now, the young ospreys have grown stronger and the fluffy down is spotted with the onset of growing feathers.\nThey no longer look feeble and weak and their fortunes have rapidly turned around since the fish supply has picked up.\nWe finally have news of PX1 (Paxman\u0027s bird) whose satellite tracker alerted us to the fact that he had died in the north of Scotland near to the Helmsdale River.\nThe carcass and tag have been recovered and it seems that his neck was broken, we believe, from colliding into newly erected deer fencing along the side of a forestry plantation.\nIt is such a terrible shame to lose this wonderful, healthy, two-year-old male osprey.\nJeremy Paxman was very saddened to hear of the loss of this bird and we are very grateful to him for his interest and support for the Tweed Valley Osprey Project.\nHe has agreed that his involvement will continue in the future, through the tracking of further ospreys.\nThe volunteers for the osprey project were invited to attend the ringing of goshawk chicks this week in Tweed Valley Forest Park and they were privileged to witness them being fitted with red darvic rings with white letters of JP and PL, by Tony Lightley, after Eve Schulte climbed the fir tree to lower them to the forest floor.\nRhona Anderson took some great photos of these magnificent birds and she has also been filming pine martens in the forest.\nThe captured footage of the whole pine marten family together and the antics of the three little kits with their mum and dad can be viewed in the video above or at \nhttps://www.flickr/photos/borderslass/28099626057/in/photostream/\nRead the latest Tweed Valley Osprey News every week throughout the summer in the Border  and Peeblesshire News newspapers\n"},{"url":null,"title":"500-mile-cycle-across-scotland-raises-20k-for-charity","story":"AN INNERLEITHEN man has cycled 516 miles in five days \u0026ndash raising \u0026pound21,000 for charity.\nMountain biker Kevin Marshall recently completed the mammoth challenge around the north Scottish coastline \u0026ndash all in aid of a cause close to his heart.\nThe idea to take on the challenge originated during a mountain biking trip to Glencoe last August, when Kevin, and his friend Steve, both agreed they wanted to do something to support the charities Macmillan and Friends of Anchor, who helped Steve\u0026rsquos mum and dad, and Kevin\u0026rsquos mum, before they passed away.\nKevin said: \u0026ldquoWe agreed that the North Coast 500 (NC500) was a suitably tough challenge, both to raise awareness and hopefully raise a reasonable amount of cash.\n\u0026ldquoThe team that completed the ride with me are all very close friends, the majority of us met when we were 18 when we started university in Aberdeen and have been close friends ever since.

The route starts in Inverness, weaves along the west coast to Applecross and then northwards towards the towns of Torridon and Ullapool.\nFrom there, the team ventured to some of the most northerly coastal points in Scotland, passing by Caithness and John o\u0026rsquo Groats before heading south again through Dingwall and back to Inverness.\n\u0026ldquoDay one was probably the most challenging followed closely by day three, Kevin added.\n\u0026ldquoIt included 2,200 metres of climbing, eight hours of riding, and a top temperature of 27 degrees. However, the highlight was riding up the Bealach na B\u0026agrave. This is every road biker\u0026rsquos dream climb, and to be able to ride it in the heat was a treat.\n\u0026ldquoThe Bealach na B\u0026agrave is a notorious mountain pass to Applecross. This twisting, single-track mountain road is the third highest road in Scotland rising up to 626 metres (2,054 ft) above the sea level. It\u0026rsquos one of the most scenic rides in the world, very similar to the great mountain passes in the Alps, with very tight hairpin bends which switch back and forth up the hillside, with gradients approaching 20 percent.\n\u0026ldquoThe biggest highlight however, and by far the most humbling, has been the generosity of people from far and wide.\n\u0026ldquoWe knew that setting a \u0026pound25,000 fundraising target was ambitious, however we never imagined we would get so close to it, with funds currently around \u0026pound21,000.\n\u0026ldquoEqually the generosity of people along the way and the support they afforded us was incredible.\n\u0026ldquoOn our last day whilst cycling down the A9 towards Inverness we were flagged down as we passed a layby by the owner of the Golspie fish and chip shop with 10 chip suppers to fuel us on our last 50 miles.\nTo donate, go to: https://bit.ly/2y4NauJ\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch-galashiels-braw-lads-gathering-2018-highlights-wednesday-night","story":"MISSED any of the action from the festivities for the 2018 Galashiels Braw Lads Gathering?\nWatch our coverage of the events across the town on Wednesday evening (June 27) below...\nDon\u0027t forget to buy next week\u0027s Border  newspaper for photos and\u0026nbspfull reports\n"},{"url":null,"title":"post-office-launches-six-week-consultation-on-new-innerleithen-branch","story":"POST Office bosses have launched a six-week consultation on the new Innerleithen branch.\nThe move follows a confirmation of opening times for customers when the concession opens within The Allotment grocery store on Innerleithen High Street on Wednesday, August 29.\nUpon opening, the branch will open from 10am to 5pm between Monday to Friday, and from 9.30am to 1pm on Saturday.

I know how much it meant to his family but I\u0026#8217m now looking forward to becoming friends and getting to know his family more.\u0026#8217If a patient has a condition that affects their bone marrow or blood, then a stem cell transplant may be their best chance of survival.Doctors will give new, healthy stem cells to the patient via their bloodstream, where they begin to grow and create healthy red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.Following a stem cell transplant, to protect both the recipient and the donor, the identity of both parties must be kept confidential for two years. They can, send anonymous letters to each other.David works for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) which partners with Anthony Nolan and has recruited more than 10,000 potential donors.SFRS watch manager John Sweeney from Oban firefigthers said: \u0026#8216Campbeltown Grammar School and the personnel at the fire station have been massive supporters of the Anthony Nolan partnership over the years.\u0026#8216I was therefore delighted that we had the possibility of holding this event in the town.\u0026#8216I would like to thank Cathie Cameron at Campbeltown Grammar School for her incredible support.\u0026#8216More than 200 people from Campbeltown joined the Anthony Nolan register through the SFRS partnership, and 1,000 in Argyll and Bute as a whole.\u0026#8217Brett said: \u0026#8216David and I exchanged cards, which were really lovely, as a chance to say thank you and learn a little bit about each other. I was waiting for the two years to go past so we could meet.\u0026#8217\u0026#8216I had butterflies before we met.\u0026#8216I was a little bit lost for words but I gave David a hug and shook hands and said thank you.\u0026#8216We had a lovely evening together with our families and the kids played together, which was great.\u0026#8216It was really important to me to be able to say thank you. Without David my kids would have grown up without a father.\u0026#8216David is also hoping to come to Devon at some stage and we’d love to come back again to see him.\u0026#8217David said he hopes the two families can become firm friends.David added: \u0026#8216Everybody says these lovely things about how I saved Brett\u0026#8217s life and I understand, but, at the end of the day, I didn\u0026#8217t do much more than give blood.\u0026#8216Our kids got along really well and I see us becoming friends rather than anybody feeling like they owe us something,\u0026#8217 he continued, \u0026#8216I always thought that the experience would be nothing compared to what the patient was experiencing.\u0026#8216Back when I joined, people were talking about bone marrow more than stem cells and it didn’t really put me off, I would have happily gone through with it to see them survive.\u0026#8216There’s a big following for Anthony Nolan in our area because there was a young woman (Johanna) a few years ago and she was the cousin of one of my best friends and she needed a transplant a few years ago.\u0026#8216She died because there was no match but I signed up because of her,\u0026#8217 he said.\u0026#8216Brett received his transplant in October 2015 and, after a long recovery, is now healthy and well.\u0026#8217\u0026#8216I joined the SRFS after donating and I get involved in school talks whenever I can. I can talk about my experience donating and it’s very rewarding to see people sign up because of an event you’re running,\u0026#8217 he explained.Amy Bartlett, Anthony Nolan\u0026#8217s regional development manager for Scotland said: ‘David did an incredibly selfless thing by donating his stem cells and it’s wonderful to see Brett doing so well.\u0026#8216To see the joy he and his family experienced, meeting the donor who provided his life-saving stem cells, is a really special moment and I wish them all the best.\u0026#8216The SFRS and Anthony Nolan partnership has already resulted in 28 people donating their stem cells.\u0026#8216Brett and David are the first pair who have been able to meet so it’s an exciting moment not only for Brett, David and their families but also the whole team at Anthony Nolan and the SFRS.\u0026#8217\u0026#8216I would encourage anyone who is aged 16-30 and in good health to consider joining the register and visit anthonynolan.org/join.Joining the register is a simple process and it could save the life of someone like Brett.\u0026#8217David McInnes and Brett grist.  NO_c26anthonynolan01_David_and_Brett\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"rnli top brass praise campbeltown lifeboat station","story":"Operations director George Rawlinson spoke exclusively to the Courier following Tuesday evening\u0026#8217s meeting with Campbeltown staff, volunteers and representatives from Her Majesty\u0026#8217s Coastguard.Mr Rawlinson said the five yearly Coast Review, held from Monday to Thursday this week, started in Oban before moving to Islay, Campbeltown, Tighnabruich and Arran.Mr Rawlinson said: \u0026#8216This week the review is looking at whether RNLI has the right lifeboats in the right places to meet the search and rescue requirements.\u0026#8216If we do make any changes to the lifeboat cover this is part of the decision making process and is an operation to gather views direct from the stations.\u0026#8216In the past five years lifeboats in this area have rescued more than 700 people from danger at sea.\u0026#8217Mr Rawlinson specifically praised the crew\u0026#8217s response during the Nancy Glen tragedy earlier this year.He said: \u0026#8216We are always keen to say that part of our visit is to recognise the crew\u0026#8217s voluntary work and dedication to rescue.\u0026#8217In addition he said the inshore D class lifeboat has been busier in recent years.

The atmosphere here is just amazing.\u0026#8217Away from the World Cup frenzy taking place across the country, Michael described life and work in Peru’s capital, the third-largest city in the Americas.He said: \u0026#8216Lima is a crazy, bustling city. A real metropolis. There are more than eight million people living here, a quarter of Peru\u0026#8217s population, so it is always hectic.‘Rush hour is madness.

I have practiced more and more with Carla as she speaks it fluently and I would like to become fluent too.’Back in football-mad Lima, Michael described the scene before Peru’s play-off win over Oceanian champions New Zealand last November, which sealed qualification.He said: \u0026#8216Peru\u0026#8217s fans knew they were one game away from the World Cup, and rightly or wrongly, did everything to help their team advance.\u0026#8216People set off fireworks and cars beeped their horns outside the New Zealand squad\u0026#8217s hotel in the early hours of the morning of the match.\u0026#8216When Peru won 2-0, there was pandemonium.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE. SILENT. CHILD. HAS. WON. AN. OSCAR.    I genuinely don\u0026rsquot know what to do now. #Oscar2018 pic.twitter/lfXWlFBCj9  The Silent Child beat four contenders to the award: DeKalb Elementary, The Eleven O\u0026rsquoClock,\u0026nbspMy Nephew Emmett and Watu Wote/All of Us.  The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees. People do not want to see the club close.  Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.

Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"haddington-pub-seeking-new-owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Organised by the darts team at The Riverside Tavern, the event was one of several held throughout the year which raised a total of \u0026pound7,787.  The cash was divided between Prostate Scotland, which helps prostate cancer sufferers, and ward 1, unit 4, oncology, for patients with cancer at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh \u0026ndash each receiving \u0026pound3,893.  The latter was chosen as the darts team\u0026rsquos captain, Michael Burgess, was treated there for leukaemia.  \u0026ldquoI wanted to give something back as they really looked after us, he said.  The walk was the pub\u0026rsquos fourth and final charity event of the year and followed a bowls competition, eight-hour darts marathon and darts competition. Participants walked six miles from The Riverside to Portobello via the promenade.  In April, a thief stole the pub\u0026rsquos collection bottle containing about \u0026pound400 but local taxi owner John Cullen stepped in to hold a bonus ball fundraiser when he heard about the break-in.  Over 32 years, the pub\u0026rsquos darts team has raised more than \u0026pound100,000 for different charities. Led by John Campbell from Whitecraig, the players have held everything from collections to 12-hour darts marathons and competitions, and annual fancy dress sponsored walks during their time based at the Deantown Bowling Club and former Dolphin Inn at Whitecraig, and now The Riverside.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

North Berwick\u0026rsquos Law Primary School P6 pupils were looking forward to the trip to Yellowcraig, by Dirleton, where one class was due to camp out tonight (Wednesday) and another tomorrow (Thursday).  Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.  The camping trip is usually held in a field on the left of the road leading into the car parks at Yellowcraig.  An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders. That\u0026rsquos why I\u0026rsquom pleased cabinet has agreed that the council will hold a consultation and carry out a feasibility study. This will be launched in due course.

They say they are being overlooked by customers at the supermarket car park who can see through the fence into the communal garden area in front of their ground-floor properties at Mill House on Eskmills Road, which is managed by Dunedin Canmore Housing Association.  Margaret and Keith Morris moved from a Dunedin Canmore property in Bathgate last September into the phase two of Mill House \u0026ndash an amenity housing development for residents aged 55 and over.  Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

Mrs Morris said that although there were some trees along the boundary, they shed their leaves in the autumn, leaving the area bare.

We would pay for them and fill in the spaces, she added.  She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.

The operation at the site off Edinburgh Road took place last Thursday.  Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.

Residents such as Seona Mason-Chadburn, who lives in Dunbar town centre, contacted the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and Tarmac, which operates Dunbar Cement Plant to the south-east of the town, about the discharge.  She told the Courier how she had attempted to use her window wipers to clear her front windscreen, only to discover the dust.  She said her windscreen felt like \u0026ldquosandpaper and compared the dust to the \u0026ldquobloom on a black grape.  A spokesman for SEPA added: \u0026ldquoEvery day SEPA works to protect and enhance Scotland\u0026rsquos environment and we are clear that compliance is non-negotiable.  \u0026ldquoIn response to local complaints, SEPA officers responded to reports of significant dust in the Dunbar area.  \u0026ldquoOfficers identified the source of the dust and are working with Tarmac to prevent a re-occurrence.  \u0026ldquoWe would advise members of the public to contact our 24-hour pollution hotline on 0800 807060 to report pollution events.  Tarmac has confirmed that the dust escaped, with an internal investigation being carried out.  Oliver Curtin, plant manager, said: \u0026ldquoIn the early hours of May 24 we experienced an isolated and brief incident where a small amount of limestone-based dust escaped from the site.  \u0026ldquoWe took action quickly and have been working with SEPA and conducting our own investigations to prevent a recurrence. We\u0026rsquore committed to minimising our environmental impact and apologise for any inconvenience caused. If anyone has any concerns or queries they can contact us at dunbar.feedback@tarmac  The incident took place when some clinker (nodules of cement) was being loaded into a store.  As soon as the discharge was detected, the process was \u0026ldquoimmediately shut down but \u0026ldquounfortunately some dust had already escaped into the atmosphere, said Tarmac.  The dry weather and wind direction resulted in the dust being carried towards Dunbar.  Tarmac has sent out a letter to residents and offered to arrange for cars to be washed at the company\u0026rsquos expense.  Additional CCTV cameras have now been installed on site to improve the company\u0026rsquos ability to gain an external view of its operations."},{"url":null,"title":"flag-ceremony-held-to-mark-armed-forces-day","story":"              A SPECIAL flag to mark Armed Forces Day was raised at Haddington Town House on Monday as East Lothian Provost John McMillan was joined by Lord Lieutenant Michael Williams and members of his cadets.  The ceremony marked the start of a week of celebrations across Scotland to mark the contribution members of the armed forces make.  Councillor McMillan said it had been a great honour to be joined by veterans from East Lothian at the flag-raising ceremony which took place on Monday morning.  He told those in attendance: \"Today is an opportunity to recognise the enormous contribution made by service personnel - past and present - and pay tribute to those who very sadly paid the ultimate sacrifice.  \"This November marks a century since the end of the First World War. A large number of residents left East Lothian in service of their country \u0026ndash many of whom, tragically, would never return.  \"Sadly, in the 100 years since, the world has seen all too many conflicts \u0026ndash some on a large scale, others more confined. In war, and in peacetime, our armed forces have promoted peace and security, confronted terrorism, and delivered aid to those in need.  \"That\u0026rsquos why, as Provost of East Lothian, I value occasions such as Armed Forces Day. A chance to give thanks, remember, reflect and look ahead.\"  Mr McMillan also paid tribute to the role of women in the military and in times of conflict, noting that 2018 was also the 100th anniversary of the first women being given the vote.  He said: \"Women played a significant role in the war effort, taking on work such as farming, transport and munition production, and the perseverance of Suffrage activity subsequently led to women being given the right to vote.  \"For a number of years now women have deservedly been playing a full and active role in our Armed Forces \u0026ndash reflective of the increasingly inclusive society in which we all live and are so keen to protect.\"  Veterans who attended the ceremony on Monday were invited to enjoy refreshments after the event."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7979931.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scotlands-best-black-pudding-made-in-east-lothian","story":"              A NORTH Berwick-based butcher is celebrating after it was judged the makers of Scotland\u0026rsquos finest black pudding.

New UK-wide research from consumer organisation Which? has revealed that while there are concerns over the rate of bank branch closures across the country, Scotland\u0027s rural communities are being worst hit by ATM closures.  Which? said their report casts doubt pledges made by Link, the UK\u0027s largest cash machine network, to protect access to cash in rural areas.  But Which? said that its research based on Link data shows that there was a net loss of 146 cashpoints in Scotland between November, last year and the end of March this year - 2.2 per cent of the network. There are now 6,367 machines in the Scottish network with around 5,400 free to use.  More ATMs across Scotland face closure as use of cash plummets  The Which? research appears to contradict a statement made by Link chairman Sir Mark Boleat to MSPs two weeks ago that the current figure for open ATMs in Scotland \"is probably the highest it has ever been\" and that \"there has been no reduction in number\". While the UK lost two per cent of its Link machines, Scotland\u0027s rural network was hardest hit with 49 shut - a 2.9 per cent net loss.  It comes two weeks after separate research revealed that bank branches have closed at a rate of two a week in Scotland over the last four years.  According to Which?, Scotland was the worst hit area in the UK for bank branches shut or scheduled to close between 2015 and 2018.    The study comes after it was revealed that Scotland faces being one of the worst affected areas of the UK as plans to cut fees for card machine operators are set to sound the death knell on thousands of \u0026lsquohole-in-the-wall\u0026rsquo machines.  July 1 marks the start of a phased cut in the fee Link receives from banks per transaction from 25p to 20p.  Link has said that up to ten per cent of the 5,400 free-to-use ATMs in Scotland could be lost as a result.  Link had previously guaranteed that ATMs which were more than 1km from the nearest alternative cash-point would not be subject to the controversial cut.  Scots cash machine inventor James Goodfellow says he is not to blame for bank cuts  Which? say closures have accelerated as operators began to learn of the fee-cutting plans.  A Which? spokesman said: \"The findings suggest that ATM operators have already decided measures designed to protect access to cash in more remote areas are insufficient and seem to run contrary to Link\u0027s promises that it will do \u0026ldquowhatever it takes to maintain ATM provision.  \"While digital payments are increasing, we are concerned that not enough is being done to preserve consumers\u0026rsquo access to cash payments, which are still relied upon by 2.7 million people across the UK.  \"UK Finance recently found that cash accounted for just over a third of all payments in 2017, showing it is still vital to millions of people.  \"Which? is concerned that Link\u0026rsquos decision was simply waved through by the regulator without considering the impact on consumers.  \"With fresh evidence of the negative impact these funding changes are having on the network, Which? is calling on the regulator to halt Link\u0026rsquos cuts, before more communities lose their ATMs.\"  New concerns for Scotland\u0027s high streets as Santander axe bank branches  Which? said that across the UK cash machines are closing at a rate of 300 every month.    Some 1,500 machines closed between November, last year and the end of March this year marking a near six-fold increase from a steady rate of fewer than 50 closures a month since 2015.  One of the largest independent ATM providers, NoteMachine, said learning of the changes in late 2017 had \u0026ldquoan immediate effect on its ability to maintain widespread free access, while the ATM Industry Association (ATMIA) said the move set the network on \u0026ldquoa path to disaster.  Harry Rose of Which? said: \u0026ldquoWith hundreds of cashpoints closing every month we have serious concerns that, far from protecting consumers\u0026rsquo access to cash, LINK\u0026rsquos plans risk destroying it.  Move to give cash machines in Scotland legal protection as thousands face axe  \u0026ldquoThese cuts could see millions of people who rely on cash in their daily lives struggling through these closures - with severe consequences for many Scottish communities and businesses.\"  Ged Killen, the Labour MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West who is introducing bill at Westminster to protect the free-to-use network said the findings were \"deeply concerning\".    He said: \"Rural Scotland has suffered the worst of these reductions and there are now real fears we could see cash machine deserts created across the country.  \u0026ldquoLINK has so far failed to meet its promises and it is time for the regulator (the PSR) to seriously look at stepping in.  Link insists that the number of free-to-use ATMs has increased across the UK and questioned the methodology.  But Which? said it stood by its research and have been told by ATM operators that, if anything, it may underestimate the true number of closures.

She suggested this was a \u0026ldquoperfect illustration of Global Britain, clinching a lucrative deal as the country embarked on life beyond the European Union.  BAE Systems has been chosen as the preferred bidder for the SEA 5000 Future Frigate, beating off competition from Italy and Spain.  The UK company will build nine warships in Adelaide with a design based on Britain\u0026rsquos Type 26 Global Combat Ship the first export of a British design for new-build frigates since the 1970s.  No 10 explained the agreement would secure more than 4000 jobs in Australia and also boost Britain\u0026rsquos export economy for generations to come.  In turn, it said it was hoped that the contract would also benefit the UK economy with exports having the potential to drive regional growth, create new jobs and showcase the strength of British innovation on the world stage.  The multi-billion pound deal is the result of four years of intensive Government engagement involving a number of departments across Whitehall.  The Prime Minister has been directly involved in making the case for the UK bid, including in bilateral talks with her Australian counterpart Malcolm Turnbull at Chequers earlier this year.  Over the past 18 months Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, Gavin Williamson, the Defence Secretary, and Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, have all visited Australia to extol the benefits of Britain\u0026rsquos world-class design, engineering and innovation.  \u0026ldquoThe sheer scale and nature of this contract puts the UK at the very forefront of maritime design and engineering and demonstrates what can be achieved by UK industry and Government working hand-in-hand, declared Mrs May.  \u0026ldquoWe have always been clear that as we leave the EU we have an opportunity to build on our close relationships with allies like Australia. This deal is a perfect illustration that the Government is doing exactly that.  \u0026ldquoAnd while this is an enormous boost for the UK economy, it will also cement our strategic partnership with one of our oldest and closest friends for decades to come, she added.  Dr Fox pointed out how the UK and Australia already enjoyed a strong trading relationship worth more than \u0026pound13 billion a year.  \u0026ldquoToday\u0026rsquos announcement is a further boost to this relationship, which will create significant opportunities for companies in both countries to deepen their trading ties.  These opportunities, the International Trade Secretary explained, included increased data and information sharing, high-end technology transfer, and collaboration at the cutting-edge of maritime expertise.  Downing Street also pointed out how the new contract would build on the century-long ties between the two nations and would allow \u0026ldquointeroperability between Australian and Royal Navy ships amid a climate of intensifying threats around the world, especially in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific regions.  The 6,900 tonne multi-mission warships are designed to support anti-submarine warfare and a whole range of other operations anywhere in the world. They will form a key part of Australia\u0026rsquos hugely respected Navy.  The contract was secured with the UK committed to getting eight of the Type 26 warfare frigates, which are currently in-build on the River Clyde and are set to enter service with the Royal Navy in the 2020s.  Charles Woodburn for BAE Systems added: \u0026ldquoI am proud that our world class anti-submarine warfare design and our approach to transferring technology and skills to the nations in which we work is expected to contribute to the development of an enduring world-class naval shipbuilding industry in Australia."},{"url":null,"title":"eu27-piles-pressure-on-theresa-may-to-come-up-with-clear-brexit-plan","story":"              PRESSURE is piling on Theresa May to produce a clear Brexit plan as Ireland\u0026rsquos Leo Varadkar suggested Britain should have come up with one two years ago \u0026ndash before the EU referendum.  As the Prime Minister emphasised how both the UK Government and the EU27 wanted to go at a \u0026ldquofaster pace in the talks, the Irish Taoiseach accepted it was a possibility that the UK could \"crash out\" of the European customs union and single market without an agreement given time was running out.  Mark Rutte, the Dutch premier, noted: \"I am not losing patience but time is getting shorter and shorter to come to an agreement.\"  Referring to the splits within Mrs May\u0027s Cabinet, he said: \"I do understand it is difficult to come to an agreement within her Cabinet and the UK Parliament but she has to.\"  Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission President, said: \"I don\u0027t have to lecture Theresa May but I would like our British friends to make clear their positions.\"  Asked if there was a risk there may not be a Brexit deal, he replied: \"We are preparing for different scenarios on the proper withdrawal agreement but, in parallel, we are working on the no deal.\"  Ahead of dinner in the Belgian capital, which was suggested could last into the wee small hours of Friday, the PM struck an upbeat tone: \"We\u0027ve already seen and been able to encourage and get flexibility from the European Union on matters\u0026hellip  \u0026ldquoBecause this isn\u0027t just about the United Kingdom, it\u0027s about ensuring that we have a partnership that works for us and a partnership that works for us will work for the EU as well.\"  On the margins of the European Council, she had talks with Mr Varadkar, who made clear it would have been helpful if the UK Government had published a Brexit White Paper in 2016.  \"You would have thought that before people voted to leave the European Union, they would have an idea what the new relationship would look like but I appreciate that that hasn\u0027t happened and two years later it still hasn\u0027t happened.\"  The Taoiseach urged Britain to soften its negotiating red lines and show some flexibility.  \"It needs to understand that we\u0027re a union of 27 member states, 500 million people. We have laws and rules and principles and they can\u0027t be changed for any one country, even a great country like Britain.  \"Any relationship that exists in the future between the EU and the UK isn\u0027t going to be one of absolute equals: we\u0027re 27 member states, the UK is one country, we\u0027re 500 million people, the UK is 60 million.

Donald Tusk, the European Council President, in a letter to EU leaders ahead of the summit, proposed the creation of \"regional disembarkation platforms\" outside the bloc where migrants could be processed, separating refugees from economic migrants.  He warned: \"There are voices in Europe and around the world claiming that our inefficiency in maintaining the external border is an inherent feature of the European Union, or - more broadly - of liberal democracy.\"  Before leaders gathered in Brussels, the embattled German Chancellor Angela Merkel starkly warned migration \u0026ldquocould determine the fate of the European Union\" some observers suggested it was more likely to determine her own fate as leader of her country.  *The Commons Brexit Committee has recommended MPs should spend at least five days debating the final Brexit deal, saying how it would be \"the most significant parliamentary debate in a generation\"."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7992962.jpg?type=article-full","title":"jan-patience-the-end-may-be-nigh-for-glasgow-school-of-arts-mackintosh-building","story":"              If buildings could talk, The Mack could tell you some stories. But this latest chapter in its chequered history takes some beating.  For over a century this majestic building which sits on a hill off Sauchiehall Street has been the beating heart of Glasgow\u0027s cultural life. It\u0027s no exaggeration to say that Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0027s Art Nouveau masterwork has fostered some of the brightest and most creative talents Scotland has ever produced.  It survived two world wars and one almost catastrophic fire four years ago. Now, with the news that large sections of The Mack will be \"dismantled\" within days following a second inferno two weeks ago, it looks like the end is nigh for The Mack.  No-one could have predicted the turn of events which led to the almost-renovated building being burned to a crisp. It was late on a Friday night \u0026ndash graduation day as it happened for Glasgow School of Art\u0027s latest cohort of students \u0026ndash when the fire was first noticed by a passing policeman. Within an hour, it had spread like wildfire. The flames licked over to the adjacent O2 ABC venue and soon its roof caved had in like a sunken blancmange.  Today, all around The Mack\u0027s majestic teetering walls, there is both physical and mental turmoil. Since that fateful night, people have been unable to return to their homes in the area around Garnethill and Sauchiehall Street. Businesses in the immediate vicinity have been locked out, with business owners and staff facing penury. Crowdfunding campaigns have even been started by small non-funded creative business based in the nearby CCA on Sauchiehall Street looking for financial help to pay staff.  Yesterday, First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, revealed during First Minister\u0027s Questions at Holyrood that a hardship fund to help people forced from their homes thanks to a safety cordon around the building will give \u0026pound1,500 to residents affected which will be matched by Glasgow City Council.  In the immediate aftermath of the fire the painter, Alison Watt, who graduated from GSA in the late 1980s and whose artist father James also graduated from the art school in the 1950s, talked on national radio about her intense feelings of loss on hearing that The Mack had been engulfed by flames yet again.  Turner Prize winning artist and GSA alumni, Douglas Gordon, flew back to Scotland from his home in Paris to see \"the corpse of the Mackintosh\". He speaks for many former students and staff when he added, \"part of my life has been cut out.\"  It all feels so distant from the cold February day last year when Gordon led me on a tour of the empty Mack for a feature in The Herald magazine. \"It [The Mack] was a place of real freedom,\" he told me. \"I haven\u0027t lived in Glasgow for nearly 30 years but it all feels really immediate. I feel both nostalgic and melancholic all at the same time.\"  While we were there, Gordon picked up a couple of pieces of green plaster from the floor which had fallen off one of the studio walls. \"Here, take this,\" he whispered conspiratorially. I still have these shards of green plaster from The Mack. They are sitting winking at me as I write.  In the two weeks since the Mack fire, mark two, I have watched as people\u0027s feelings turned from shock to anger. I have read accusations of mismanagement on the art school\u0027s part and rumours that there was inadequate insurance in place.  A statement put out by the Glasgow School of Art the day after put it so baldly, the Mackintosh Building had been undergoing a period or extensive restoration following the fire in 2014 \u0027and therefore has not been a part of the GSA\u0027s operational campus for four years.\"  The blame game started immediately in the media and on social media. All over my virtual world \u0026ndash admittedly filled with people linked to the creative community in Scotland \u0026ndash there has been much wailing and gnashing of teeth. People are livid and looking for someone to blame.  Where was the sprinkler system in the renovated building, people asked? That same question was asked four years ago and the same people feel they didn\u0027t get answers.  Leading GSA-trained architect, Alan Dunlop, prompted anger when he suggested that The Mack should be demolished and an international competition be launched to create a new building with the same spirit. Mackintosh was an innovator, he said, and he would not have wanted a facsimile\u0026hellip  Since Mackintosh isn\u0027t around to give his view, we will never know.    Friday\u0027s cartoon by Steven Camley  Labour MP Paul Sweeney, who is director of the Glasgow Building Preservation Trust, was one of the first public figures to be allowed behind the cordon around The Mack after the fire. His observations that the walls were still solid led to some optimism in among the initial gloom. Last night, he said he was \u0026ldquoopen minded about holding a public inquiry, but insisted there first needed to be more clarity about how the fire started.  So what was it that was so special about The Mack? In my eyes, it was like the most charismatic lover you\u0027d ever been with \u0026ndash or never been with. I\u0027d have given anything to have been one of the thousands of students who passed through these magical swing doors in Mackintosh\u0027s famous elongated art nouveau script with the words ART (on the in door) and SCHOOL (on the out door).  I visited it as a sixteen-year-old and fell in love on the spot with the place. How could I not, with these doors and that library? When I went home to Ayrshire and told my normally mild-mannered dad I wanted to apply to get go to this magical place, he swiftly put the kibosh on the idea. \"But how would you get a job as an artist,\" he spluttered?  As it turned out, getting a job as anything in the 1980s was going to be hard but if my subsequent degree in English and Scottish Literature had any use, it led me (eventually) into writing about art. And that meant I got to visit The Mack as an almost-insider.  As one alumni and former member of GSA\u0027s management staff wrote to me in the wee sma\u0027 hours of June 16: \"We all smoked in the building and had done so for decades. Stamping cigarettes out on timber floors surrounded by white spirit. Rennie, the librarian, was a chronic chain smoker in his wee office in the library. Maybe this is too much information, but I\u0027m probably one of many who made love in the building. This latest news is death.\"  The fixtures and fittings rescued from the last fire at GSA remain off-site. Its beautiful library had been rebuilt and is sitting in a warehouse in Edinburgh. Like a confused child piece waiting for a home.  I sent the painter Alison Watt a message last night asking her what one thing she\u0027d like to tell The Mack.  Almost instantly, she wrote back: \"You continue to live inside all of us who love you.\""},{"url":null,"title":"calls-to-locate-new-glasgow-school-of-art-building-in-citys-east-end","story":"              Local councillors have made a unusual suggestion about the future of the Mackintosh building.  As the next steps for the Glasgow School of Art\u0027s famous building remain uncertain, Glasgow politicians have suggested recreating the structure in the city\u0027s East End.  Martin McElroy and Maureen Burke both claim the Charles Rennie Mackintosh designed building could be a boon to areas of regeneration.  One wants to see the building moved to Dennistoun while the other suggests Easterhouse would be a welcoming home.  Mr McElroy, the Labour party\u0027s representative in Springburn/Robroyston ward, said: \u0026ldquoLike all Glaswegians I was saddened to see the damage that this fire has caused to one of the most beautiful buildings in the city.  \u0026ldquoIf it cannot be saved and needs to be rebuilt we should look at locating the new Glasgow School of Art in a part of the city that requires regeneration.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of gap sites in the north and east of the city that would be suitable and could provide a huge boost to an area that needs it.\"  The politician believes cash to take down and rebuild the building - known as the Mack - could come from the sale of the land it currently sits on.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe land in Garnethill is potentially very valuable and could offset some of the costs associated with a rebuild as well.  \u0026ldquoBecause of the world famous nature of our School of Art we could potentially be talking about regenerating an entire neighbourhood.  \u0026ldquoAs a proud son of Glasgow, I am certain that this is something that Charles Rennie Mackintosh would be happy to have as the next phase of his legacy.  Building control experts have inspected the building in the wake of the fire to determine whether it could be saved.  Initial possibilities included another restoration project, estimated at around \u0026pound100 million or taking the remaining structure down and rebuilding it brick by brick on the current site, which could cost as much as \u0026pound200 million, according to construction experts.  Nicola Sturgeon said after visiting the site that the Scottish Government was ready to do \u0026ldquoanything we reasonably can to ensure the Mackintosh Building has a future.  Maureen Burke, Labour councillor for the North East ward, suggested Easterhouse as a potential new home for the Mack.  The area has undergone extensive regeneration, including the building of arts centre The Bridge.  Ms Burke said: \u0026ldquoAs every politician and member of the public would say, it is really sad what has happened.  \u0026ldquoIf they can save the building, that is great.  \u0026ldquoIf it is the case they need to look at rebuilding it, as a councillor for the north and east end of the city, we should be looking at other options and this could be one.  \u0026ldquoThere is a lot of regeneration happening on this side of the city.  \u0026ldquoIf you look at The Bridge, no one thought that would work but now it is thriving.  \u0026ldquoEasterhouse has various plots of vacant land available and we should be looking at that as an option."},{"url":null,"title":"ken-smiths-diary-doing-the-business-a-dogs-life-driven-demented","story":"              Driven demented  AND so the hot weather continues, although some folk find it uncomfortable.

Committee convener Edward Mountain said: \"Issues such as low-emission zones for vehicles, pavement and double parking, and smart ticketing have the potential to impact on how people travel around Scotland, and we want to find out whether these proposals are the right ones for local communities.  \"We know that transport and connectivity are of utmost importance to people across Scotland, and the committee wants to hear the views of the public and stakeholder organisations to help shape how the committee and the parliament responds to the Scottish Government\u0027s proposals.  \"The committee has today issued a survey to ask people a number of questions, ranging from how your local authority could use the new powers proposed in the Bill to improve local bus services, and whether they support proposals on smart ticketing and prohibitions on pavement and double parking.\""},{"url":null,"title":"the-end-of-the-unusually-splendid-building-artists-reflect-on-life-inside-the-mack","story":"              \"IT WAS an unusually splendid building, said Alasdair Gray, one of the Glasgow School of Art\u0026rsquos many notable alumni.  The Mack\u0027s interior was bathed in light, boasting huge plains of space, artists often remarked.  It had almost ideal studios for drawing and painting, and other, smaller spaces for private contemplation and study.  And a basement lecture theatre with its uncomfortable timber benches, where everything and everyone, felt close and intimate.  And, after degree shows - which often felt rather cramped and chaotic in the studio spaces - it was also a venue, perhaps, for some after-hours celebrations.  Even then, if you were toting a glass of white wine past the red-stickered artworks of young artists on their way to the world outside its walls, it was easy to feel that year\u0026rsquos graduating class was part of a continuum of art making \u0026ndash in sculpture, paint, pencil, watercolour and oils \u0026ndash stretching back to Mackintosh himself.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot that he just designed the building, there was more: it was the light fixtures, some of the furniture, the library, the clocks, the windows, Mr Gray said.  It was at the heart of generations of artists\u0027 lives, intimately so. Many speak of it like an old friend, or much-loved relative, or nurturing home, and its loss a personal bereavement.  Now fire has extinguished the light and the space for art is only ruin.  For Gray, the Mackintosh Building, where he studied painting, was an historical monument, too, to a singular talent.  Yesterday he quoted the film maker and writer Timothy Neat, who once said Mackintosh showed in his most famous building that he had enough talent, he could have \u0026ldquodesigned a civilisation.  Mr Gray added: \u0026ldquoThere were three great architects at the beginning of the 19th century: Frank Lloyd Wright in Chicago, [Antoni] Gaudi in Barcelona, Charles Rennie Mackintosh in Glasgow.  \u0026ldquoThey were the figures, doing new and exciting work, finding a new style to counter the Victorians, even though Glasgow did not get the support he needed in Glasgow, and was even black-balled from arts clubs.  \u0026ldquoBut all there is left of his work now is the Hill House in Helensburgh, Scotland Street School \u0026ndash which is not even a school anymore but a museum which shows you what a school looks like \u0026ndash and of course the church in Maryhill. This fire, it is rotten for Glasgow.  This week Professor Ray McKenzie, an honorary professor at Glasgow School of Art, told Artforum that in the building, Mackintosh had kept the balance of \u0026ldquobeauty, durability and fitness for purpose in perfect equilibrium. He added: \u0026ldquoAfter 34 years teaching in the Mack I never once tired of its life-enhancing generosity as a design, its continual reaffirmation of the \u0026lsquopoetics of architecture.  Martin Boyce, the Turner Prize winning artist and alumni of the school, spoke this week to Frieze online that the building was magical.  He added: \u0026ldquoTo enter through those swing doors marked \u0026lsquoIn\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoOut\u0026rsquo, \u0026lsquoArt\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoSchool\u0026rsquo was to enter a place of art.  \u0026ldquoWith the exception of a small office halfway up the main stairwell, I never had any sense of administration. It seemed to be all bright studios and dark stairwells, a jewel-like library and the \u0026lsquoHen Run\u0026rsquo corridor.  Karla Black, another notable alumni and Turner Prize nominee, said that she can walk through the whole building in her head, \u0026ldquoalong the Hen Run, see the graffiti on the hard, uncomfortable benches in the Mackintosh Lecture Theatre, walk up the stairs to the museum.  She noted: \u0026ldquoI loved it. I would sit in the old library, reading and staring at it, thinking \u0026lsquoI can\u0026rsquot believe I\u0026rsquom allowed to be in here\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoMy memories of the building are visceral and physical: my hand flat on the brass plate of the big, black, wooden swing doors, marked \u0026lsquoIn\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoOut\u0026rsquo in Art Nouveau font. I must have done that hundreds of times."},{"url":null,"title":"greens-demand-details-on-30m-loan-to-sturgeon-advisers-business","story":"              THE Scottish Greens have demanded more information about a taxpayer-funded \u0026pound30m loan to a business bought by one of Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos economic advisers.  The SNP Government yesterday announced it was giving the money to Ferguson Marine Engineering Limited (FMEL), despite questions over its financial disclosures.  Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said the money would provide \u0026ldquoworking capital for the Clyde shipbuilder alongside private investment intended to help diversify the business.  The Port Glasgow yard was acquired by billionaire Jim McColl, a member of the First Minister\u0026rsquos Council of Economic Advisers, after it went into administration in 2014.  However it has been flagged on the Companies House website for not yet filing its annual accounts for 2016, which were due by September 2017.  The most recent public accounts are for the year ending December 2015.  Its immediate parent company, Ferguson Marine Engineering (Holdings) Ltd, is also nine months overdue filing its annual accounts, according to the Companies House website.  Ferguson Marine last night said it had an approval for late filing, but did not explain why it needed it - extensions are normally granted for events outwith a company\u0026rsquos control.  There is no public record of a late filing approval on the Companies House website. Both firms are ultimately owned by Mr McColl\u0026rsquos Clyde Blowers empire.  Green MSP John Finnie said: \u0026ldquoTransparency is vital when public funds are concerned, and this substantial loan must be held up to scrutiny.  \u0026ldquoShip servicing and repair, low carbon marine projects and decommissioning work are all very worthy but it\u0026rsquos clearly a concern if public funds are being used to support a company with a chequered history.  Mr Mackay said one of Mr McColl\u0026rsquos investment vehicles, Clyde Blowers Capital, would also invest alongside the loan to diversify the yard\u0026rsquos work.  Mr McColl recently spoke of expanding into green energy.  The year after Mr McColl acquired Ferguson\u0026rsquos it won a \u0026pound97m contract to build two new \u0026lsquodual fuel\u0026rsquo ferries for government-owned CalMac, securing work for the 150 staff.  However the contract has not gone smoothly, with the first vessel delayed from May this year to the winter, despite Mr McColl assuring ministers in early 2017 that it would be on time.  Ferguson Marine finance director Tom Cousins said: \u0026ldquoThis loan will allow us to accelerate our diversification into areas of innovation in green energy and marine transport and other opportunities such as decommissioning, on which where we are well-place to capitalise.  \u0026ldquoWe have approval from Companies House for the extension on the filing of our accounts. This was not a government bail-out. The investment alongside Clyde Blowers Capital is to support continued diversification.  Mr Mackay said: \u0026ldquoCommercial shipbuilding on the Clyde has a long and proud history, and it is essential that we continue to support this important industry and help it reach its full potential.  \u0026ldquoThis investment allows FMEL to further diversify their business by moving into innovative areas, like low-carbon marine projects, and target decommissioning work.  \u0026ldquoThe loan is a strategic investment in our industrial capability as both the marine engineering sector and commercial shipbuilding have vital roles to play in Scotland\u0026rsquos future."},{"url":null,"title":"business success for kintore couple","story":"\t\t\t\tDonna and Jason Orton, who have been helped by Business Gateway Aberdeen City \u0026amp Shire, opened the doors to their unique business in Abercrombie Court, Westhill, just over a year ago.

Clients, who suffer from a range of respiratory issues, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and allergies, spend their time relaxing in one of two treatment rooms where the walls and floor are clad in salt. A specialist machine then finely grinds medical grade salt that is released into the air at prescribed concentration levels for the duration of each session.                                                    The therapy, also known as halotherapy, dates back to the ancient Greeks who sought the benefits offered by naturally occurring salt caves for improved health and wellbeing. Providing a 100% natural and drug free complimentary treatment, halotherapy, derived from the Greek alas, meaning \"salt\", is believed to loosen mucus and reduce inflammation making breathing easier.

Sue Ryder launched an appeal in June 2017 to double the size of its local neurological care centre, which cares for people living with long-term neurological conditions including Huntington’s disease, multiple sclerosis and acquired brain injuries.                                                    The expansion project was introduced in response to the growing demand for neurological care in the North East of Scotland. Sue Ryder Dee View Court is currently home to 24 people living with complex and long-term conditions, with a waiting list double this amount.        The appeal has already reached £2.2million, with the charity now encouraging community fundraisers to set their targets in £1,000 segments, or ‘bricks’ as part of the Brick by Brick campaign - each £1,000 raised equates to one brick in the new centre. Emma Leiper Finlayson, Capital Appeal Manager for Sue Ryder Dee View Court said: “There’s a desperate need for unified neurological care in Scotland and our waiting list increases all the time.  We urgently need to expand, and our Dee View appeal is the first step in Sue Ryder’s strategy to care for more people who need help to live well and thrive across Scotland.“Since launching the appeal, we have been overwhelmed and delighted with the response from the community. In particular, the Brick by Brick initiative, which has been a fantastic platform to engage local companies and schools in some fun and creative fundraising. By buying a brick for the extension they are quite literally helping us build brighter futures for people in their community.“Of course, our residents have been involved in the appeal too, with one recently taking part in the Aberdeen Kiltwalk with her family, whilst other residents have encouraged their friends and family to undertake challenges, such as the Great Aberdeen Run.

From today, more people, including families and disabled people, can claim Universal Credit and access the extra help it provides.”Single jobseekers are already receiving support from their dedicated work coach to find employment or increase their hours and earnings. Now, all types of claimants will be able to benefit from the improved, personalised, one-to-one support that Universal Credit offers.                                                                                                        Carol Sadler, from Jobcentre Plus said: “Universal Credit offers tailored support, which includes more personalised help from a work coach. The new system is also more flexible, which means people can take on short-term work to develop their skills and build up their experience. “Our staff are trained to support people throughout the claim process. We’d encourage anyone who needs extra help or information to come and talk to their work coach.”Those on Universal Credit will now have 24-hour access to an online account that they can use to manage their claim, including reporting changes of circumstances, checking the details of their claim and date of their next Universal Credit payment. With the application process now completely online, Universal Credit streamlines the system, making benefits simpler to navigate and easier to understand.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin.

Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general.

Its total value was said to be between \u0026pound150 million and \u0026pound300m.Work on that contract is expected to get under way in September with three launches due to be completed by November next year.The orders will see the company\u0026rsquos local workforce increase from around 30, at present, to up to 160.\u0026ldquoThis will give us continual work in Caithness until 2020, although there will be peaks and troughs along the way \u0026ndash but this is great news all round, Mr Watt added.Jonathan Tame, company vice president for the UK and Canada, said: \u0026ldquoWe are pleased to have the opportunity to bring our extensive expertise to a project of this importance.\u0026ldquoIn doing so it demonstrates Shell\u0026rsquos confidence in our value-adding solutions, and continues a successful North Sea collaboration that has been in place since 1984.The Penguins field was discovered in 1974 and first developed in 2002.The three pipeline bundles for Statoil will involve the largest diameter pipe assembled in the far north.The bulk of the fabrication will be done in Caithness, with design and project management work due to be undertaken at Subsea7\u0026rsquos premises in Aberdeen and at Stavanger in Norway.At the time that order was announced in December last year, Mr Watt said: \u0026ldquoIt is good to have Statoil back. The last bundle we did for them was in 2003.\u0026ldquoIt is an important project and shows pipeline bundles are the preference for developing the North Sea sector. It is the right product at the right time.The Statoil order will include pipeline bundles and control umbilicals required for the development.The Snorre field is sited within the Tampen area of the Norwegian North Sea.Since the last pipeline was launched in Caithness in March last year, the company has refurbished the rail track which is used to transport the bundles to the sea and on to the tugs before being taken to their destination.Friday 29 Jun 2018 7:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116349.jpg","title":"Technical issues force delay to new Pulteney post office service","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe long-established Pulteneytown Post Office in Smith Terrace closed its doors for the last time on Thursday.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism. It will be \u0026ldquoapplied consistently and fairly across Highland, a council spokeswoman said.Under the plan, the budget and decisions on parking would be devolved to local committees with revenue reinvested locally.Friday 29 Jun 2018 7:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116272.jpg","title":"Wick High School pupils light up UK Apps for Good finals with bike success","story":"\u0026nbspThey won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals in London on Wednesday night after wowing the competition judges with their Light Bike \u0026ndash which deploys smart lights to help cyclists safe and visible.The pupils \u0026ndash Nicholas Mann (13), from Ulbster, Caleb James (14), from Kirk, Lewis Buchan (14), Russell Mackenzie (13) and Steven Gunn (16), all Wick \u0026ndash were led by their computing science teacher Chris Aitken.Speaking after the finals at London\u0026rsquos Rich Mix venue, Mr Aitken said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore absolutely delighted to have won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals.

His first order of priority, however, must be the unfinished business of implementing cheaper ferry fares on ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“Having already waited a decade since the government first introduced RET on west coast routes, people in the Northern Isles should not have to wait any longer.“The First Minister promised RET in the first half of 2018. That means Michael Matheson must deliver before parliament rises for the summer recess at the end of this week.”Mr Halcro Johnston says that the Northern Isles have been left in limbo by the RET uncertainties, adding that he has written to Mr Matheson in a bid to see the RET commitment delivered.He said: “The new transport secretary has just days to implement RET for ferry fares to Orkney and Shetland, in line with commitment made by his predecessor and after years of promises from the SNP.“The constant delays we have seen regarding RET have caused real uncertainty in the Northern Isles and have left residents and visitors unable to plan journeys knowing what the eventual costs will be.\u0026#8221\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It also found that 62 per cent of posts are in professional occupations.Eilean Siar, Glasgow and Highland are the three areas with the highest number of jobs in which Gaelic is considered essential, together accounting for 93 per cent of the Scottish total.The study was welcomed by Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, who commented that the growth in desirable and essential jobs making use of Gaelic language would provide young people with a wealth of exciting career choices.\"I hope that this report will encourage more people to consider learning Gaelic,\" he added.As well as looking at the demand for Gaelic language skills, the report looks at Gaelic education, analyses the opportunities and challenges, and suggests future action.Damien Yeates, chief Executive of SDS, said: \"Developing a detailed evidence base of current and future skills demand is essential for all parts of our economy, and the Gaelic language labour market is no exception.\"Last year SDS published the second edition of its Gaelic language plan, and this study was one of the key commitments contained in that plan.\"The evidence will help inform future investment aimed at promoting the Gaelic language and culture.\"Shona MacLennan, chief executive of B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig, commented: \"B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig is clear that growing the number of Gaelic-essential jobs and jobs which use Gaelic is important in ensuring that Gaelic is used more often, by more people and in a wider range of situations.\"The key challenge is to ensure that the flow of people with high quality Gaelic language skills entering the labour market is matched to the demand from employers across the public, private and third sectors, and from across Scotland.\"\u0026nbspFuture actions proposed in the report include forming a national group with responsibility for Gaelic language skills, and increased monitoring and evaluation of the activities supporting the language.Charlotte Wright, Chief Executive of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), said: \"Gaelic is fundamental to HIE\u0026rsquos unique remit which integrates economic and community development throughout the Highlands and Islands.\"Our support has helped numerous organisations which enable Gaelic to flourish, and we look forward to continuing to work with businesses, social enterprises and community organisations that can add value through using Gaelic to help realise its full potential.\"Friday 29 Jun 2018 7:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

However as soon as he was able, he was back in the saddle.The supermarket worker was delighted with his recent racing success followed by his selection for the GB squad for the world championships at the end of July and beginning of August.\"I really wanted to retain the national title but this year I knew I had my work cut out as I was up against my friend and main competitor Ben Watson who is a full time GB rider,\" he said.\"It was a great race. I felt good going into it and was able to counter any attacks and came down to a sprint where I was able to take the win.\"The news got better when British Cycling announced the world championship squad for this year with my name on it. I\u0026rsquom really looking forward to pulling on the GB kit for the first time.\"The hard work is paying off and I am hoping this is a stepping stone towards becoming a full-time GB rider. I\u0026rsquom really happy at being given this opportunity, being only 18 years old.\"He said the last eight months had only been possible thanks to the generosity of Moray Estates in paying for all his training and racing travel costs.He also thanked Tesco Dingwall which had been flexible with his shifts, allowing him to travel to races.Last year\u0026rsquos Strathpuffer 24-hour endurance event raised \u0026pound1000 to be divided between Fin and the charity Lupus UK.Friday 29 Jun 2018 7:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Most damaging of all, Loganair noted, was the announcement by Flybe that it was entering a new franchise agreement with Eastern Airways and would compete head-to-head on six routes.            Despite the turbulence, Loganair booked record turnover of £110.7m, a rise of 7 per cent. Passenger numbers were up 6.2 per cent to an all-time high of 812,541, but the load factor – the percentage of seats filled on scheduled flights – fell from 62.8 per cent to 59.8 per cent, due to the overcapacity on routes with Flybe competition. Just under 78 per cent of flights ran on time.Chairman David Harrison said: “This year’s results bring to an end 17 consecutive years in profit for Loganair, and the fact that we forecast last year that we would be loss-making in 2017/18 makes it no less painful.“The extent of the loss is a direct result of competition on six of our eight largest routes, and from the outset we maintained that the markets on these routes were simply not big enough to sustain the level of seat capacity being introduced. This indeed proved to the case.“However, these costs are non-recurring, and Loganair is now on the front foot and ready for a successful year ahead.”Managing director Jonathan Hinkles added: “In a challenging year, I’m delighted to say that the transition from franchise partner to an airline operating in its own right was completed on schedule.            “In the last 12 months we have transformed our operation with wholesale changes to our reservations, revenue accounting and check-in systems.“We have carried out a full rebrand, repainted our aircraft in tartan livery, introduced new crew and ground staff uniform, brought in a comprehensive system of service improvements for our customers and launched a significant sales and marketing programme.“I’m equally pleased to be able to report that the response from our customers to these developments has been extremely positive.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4754753.1528987528!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures how to make your own scottish morning rolls","story":"\t\tMorning rolls are one of Scotland\u0026#8217s best loved foods, Scottish food writer Fraser Wright provides a recipe on how to make your own.\t\t\t\tYou need to start these the night before you want to eat them, however they last well and toast very well too.            What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4760309.1530088555!/image/image.jpg","title":"tom peterkin reshuffle was long overdue but when it came it was dramatic","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...\t\tNicola Sturgeon\u0026#8217s reshuffle may have been a long time coming, but when it did come it was nothing if not dramatic, writes Tom Peterkin\t\t\t\tSix ministers have gone and there is the possibility of more casualties tomorrow when the First Minister finalises her junior ministerial team.            In the relatively brief history of devolution, one has to go back to Jack McConnell’s reshuffle of November 2001 to find one of comparable ferocity. Then, five senior and two junior ministers went in a reshuffle that earned the then Labour first minister the nickname “Jack the Knife”. Mr (now Lord) McConnell wielded the axe within hours of taking the top job. In contrast, it has taken Ms Sturgeon months, if not years, to carry out a similar exercise.            Yesterday’s reshuffle was long overdue. For many months now a somewhat tired-looking ministerial team had seemed to struggle to get a grip on domestic issues. In some ways that feeling of drift was typified yesterday with the Scottish Government having to deal with news on cancer waiting times and Education Secretary John Swinney shelving key education legislation.As Ms Sturgeon’s right hand man, Mr Swinney was always going to be safe from yesterday’s blood-letting. The same was not true of her good friend, Health Secretary Shona Robison. Ms Robison has been a lame duck struggling to swim against a tide of poor NHS performance indicators. As was clear from her resignation letter, Ms Robison has also had some very difficult personal issues to contend with. In those circumstances, it is perhaps easy to understand why she would want some time away from the pressure cooker environment of Cabinet politics. Ms Sturgeon will be sad to see the departure of one of her oldest friends in politics. But the truth is a fresh face is desperately needed at what is always one of the trickiest portfolios for a government.• READ MORE: Scottish Government Cabinet Reshuffle: Who’s in and Who’s out?            All sorts of spin can be spun about Keith Brown moving into an enhanced depute role with the SNP, but the reality is that Scotland’s economic growth is still lagging behind the rest of the UK. Mr Brown is a casualty of the decision to put his brief under Finance Secretary Derek Mackay’s umbrella – a change that seems entirely sensible. Angela Constance’s departure is perhaps not unexpected with her post going to former public health minister Aileen Campbell. Of the promotions, Humza Yousaf faces a tough job as Justice Secretary. That is clear given the challenges that Michael Matheson has faced, having to get to grips with the dysfunctional nature of Police Scotland. Mr Yousaf has shown himself to be a politician of determination in his handling of the notoriously tricky transport brief – which now goes to Mr Matheson, who remains in the Cabinet. Jeane Freeman, who in a previous life was a Labour adviser, has long been seen as a politician destined for the Cabinet. She has the unenviable task of taking over the health brief that always proves so difficult no matter who is in charge.             So far Ms Freeman has proved herself relatively sure-footed, aside from an episode last year when she was accused of making a clumsy attempt at smearing a nurse in a TV debate.The return of Michael Russell is an indication of Brexit looming on the horizon, while Shirley Anne Somerville faces the intimidating task of setting up Scotland’s social security system."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4761604.1530212354!/image/image.jpg","title":"support call for complex decisions on pension pots","story":"\t\tMany people need more support when choosing how to use their pension savings as they are \u0026#8220now required to make more complicated decisions than ever before\u0026#8221, the City regulator has said.\t\t\t\tThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has been looking at how the sector has been working since pension freedoms were introduced in 2015.            The body wants to see improvements in the clarity and timing of communications from firms before people make decisions about what to do with their pension pot.            The FCA is proposing “wake-up” packs should be sent to people from the age of 50 and then every five years until the customer has fully accessed their pension pot. These would have to include a single page summary in clear language, sometimes called a pensions passport. Firms would also include specific retirement risk warnings at the same time as the new packs.The pension freedoms give over-55s a wider range of choices over how they use their pension pot rather than being required to buy an annuity retirement income.The FCA said the proposed new communications would help consumers engage with the risks and choices they face and prompt them to access support and guidance. Christopher Woolard, executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA, said: “We know that the choices introduced by the pension freedoms have been popular with many consumers.“However, they’re now required to make more complicated decisions than ever before.            “Many people need more support when making choices.“The measures we have outlined today will help them think about that earlier, create investment pathways to help them with their choices and make costs and charges easier to understand.”The authority is also inviting views on a more structured set of options for people drawing down their pension.The regulator said “investment pathways” would help consumers consider what their retirement objectives were and ultimately end up with a more appropriate investment solution.            The FCA estimates some drawdown customers could receive 37 per cent more retirement income from their pot every year by investing in a mix of assets rather than cash.The regulator also said it wants drawdown options to be good value for money. It is proposing firms include a one-year charge figure in pounds and pence in the key features illustration they provide.The FCA found charges vary considerably and can often be “complex, opaque and hard to compare”.It said if firms fail to introduce investment pathways with appropriate charge levels, “the FCA has not ruled out introducing a cap on drawdown charges”.Twice as many pots have been used for drawdown than to buy an annuity. A third (32 per cent) of these were accessed without advice, compared with 5 per cent before the freedoms.            The report said: “We have seen that many consumers, particularly when focused on taking their tax-free cash, take the ‘path of least resistance’ and enter drawdown with their existing provider.” The regulator is consulting on some of the proposed measures."},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 19 ","story":"Shetland’s young sports competitors retained their hold on the Stuart Cup at the weekend, with the margin of victory, in the end, being fairly comfortable.\nGoing into the last event of the junior inter-county, the netball, Orkney had to win by 32 points to overhaul the visitors’ lead. Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"hotel chain sets its sights on up and coming destination lerwick ","story":"\nTravelodge has written to the SIC to ask about potential development sites.\nShetland is one of 20 areas identified by the firm, as the chain looks to expand across Scotland.\nAccording to Travelodge, they have written to the SIC to propose a \u0026#8220joint development partnership\u0026#8221 to finance a new hotel in Shetland, which they claim will unlock \u0026#8220development potential in the isles\u0026#8221.\nBut the council\u0026#8217s communications department said that the authority could not yet comment on the proposals because the letter had not arrived.\nThe firm announced plans for expansion on Monday as its newest hotel, located in Stirling city centre, opened.\nTravelodge\u0026#8217s plans have seen them write to 20 local authorities across Scotland, with Kirkwall in Orkney also on the firm\u0026#8217s radar.\nIf successful the company claims the expansion will represent an investment of £125 million and could create 385 new jobs.\nAccording to the chain, the letter to the SIC outlines how it has worked alongside 12 local authorities in England and Wales to create jobs and boost the economy.\nTravelodge believes it can do the same for Shetland, which it has identified as an \u0026#8220up-and-coming tourist destination\u0026#8221, and in doing so help the council to achieve its aims of increasing visitor numbers.\nAgreements between the hotel chain and local authorities have had unique funding structures, Travelodge said. Hotels have been built on surplus local authority land, with funding provided either through internal council resources, the Public Works Loan Board or third-party resources.\nUpon completion, local authorities can choose to either retain ownership of the hotel, receiving an annual rent, or sell the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.\nTravelodge chairman Brian Wallace said: \u0026#8220Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.\u0026#8221\nHe added: \u0026#8220We want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Lerwick. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Shetland Islands Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.\u0026#8221\n \u0026raquo\nHope it\u0026#8217s cleaner than the one in Bridge St / union St  Aberdeen\nI\u0026#8217d hope it would be staffed by locals here and they would have more pride in their work, saying that ive been in London Edinburgh Glasgow and Aberdeen ones and they have always been spotless\nSo, Travelodge wants to build a bland uninspiring hotel in Shetland and it wants SIC to pay for it. Really ? I think they are taking the ****. How about, they discuss with SIC and the existing Shetland tourism providers to see if another hotel is needed and if so, they pay for it. If they have a good business case they should have no problem is raising the necessary funds for the venture.\nI would suggest that people interested in the Travelodge empire google Travelodge owners .  It quickly becomes evident that it is a huge money making business which is definitely not in need of financial support from Shetland.  What a nerve these people have.

One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf.

The boat was equipped with a three bilge-pump system but one of the pumps had failed, meaning they only had one as back-up. Ms Weaver said: “We try to be two failures away from a problem.” Also, she said, she had to “err on the side of caution” because the boat was carrying 12 passengers.\n was able to proceed “under her own power and pumping under her own power” into Lerwick. She is currently in the small boat harbour.\n and two sunken klondykers.\n is used for various types of dive trips, including recreational and wreck diving in locations in Orkney and Shetland, including Scapa Flow and Fair Isle as well as in northern Scotland and Faroe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}]
