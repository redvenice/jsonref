That they belong.\u0027\u0027It doesn\u0027t feel good to have been working at the company that put that out there,\u0027 Terra Field, a software engineer at Netflix, wrote in a Medium post.\u0027Especially when we\u0027ve spent years building out the company\u0027s policies and benefits so that it would be a great place for trans people to work.\u0027Three employees including Field were reportedly suspended last week after crashing a virtual meeting for executives on the Chappelle special, but later reinstated. Another was sacked for leaking internal data about the cost of the program.The walkout and rally have drawn support from film and television celebrities such as Jameela Jamil (The Good Place) and Jonathan Van Ness (Queer Eye), who have recorded a video message expressing \u0027love and support\u0027 for the movement.\u0027This has been such a challenging time I\u0027m sure for all of you,\u0027 Van Ness said in a video released Wednesday by the activist group Team Trans. \u0027It really is so often the trans, non-binary and intersex folks who actually advance theses conversations so often at risk to themselves and to their careers.\u0027Van Ness identifies as nonbinary.\u0027I know it\u0027s not easy. I know it\u0027s scary. I have so much respect for you and so much love and gratitude for you for sticking up for the LGBT+ community\u0027s right to dignity and safety and respect,\u0027 said Jamil. Acclaimed comedian Hannah Gadbsy - who has her own popular Netflix specials - last week called the streaming giant an \u0027amoral algorithm cult.\u0027Chappelle has been accused of mocking transgender people in the past, but remains hugely popular.In The Closer, he describes a US rapper who \u0027punched the LGBTQ community right in the AIDS,\u0027 compares trans women to the use of Blackface, and jokes about threatening to kill a woman and stash her body in his car.Chappelle - who is black - also argues that white gay people \u0027are minorities until they need to be white again,\u0027 and that LGBTQ communities have made progress in a few years that black people have not enjoyed in decades.Netflix trans employees and allies release a list of demands ahead of the walkout - The VergeNetflix Employees Stage Walkout to Protest Dave Chappelle Special - Variety"},{"url":null,"title":"Britney Spears fianc Sam Asghari spotted house hunting Jeffree Stars mansion","story":"   Last year, at her father\u0027s request, the conservatorship (the one dealing with Britney\u0027s personal affairs, not the conservatorship controlling her finances) was temporarily transferred from Jamie to her long-time caregiver Jodi Montgomery.While he blamed his stepping down on health issues, Jamie\u0027s decision came amid accusations that he had gotten into an altercation with Britney\u0027s then 14 year-old son Sean Preston, now 16.Kevin Federline - Britney\u0027s ex and the father of Sean and his brother Jayden James, 15 - made a police report and took out a restraining order against his former father-in-law after the incident in which, reportedly, a \u0027very angry\u0027 Jamie broke down the door of a room Sean had locked himself in and \u0027shook\u0027 the frightened teen.Finally last month, a judge  suspended Jamie as the conservator of Britney\u0027s personal life and $60 million estate after 13 years, appointing accountant John Zabel as a temporary conservator. The suspension comes as allegations of his mistreatment of his daughter - including secretly recording her calls and messages - have ramped up the furor over his conservatorship."},{"url":null,"title":"Speed booster jabs save Christmas say experts amid calls Covid Plan B enacted","story":"Share this articleCovid restrictions: Some Plan B measures to support testing and the NHS are set to happen in parts of England"},{"url":null,"title":"Colleagues LBC host Steve Allen 67 call sacked","story":"Share this articleSteve Allen\u0027s LBC co-workers want him fired for fat-shaming Strictly star Tilly Ramsay"},{"url":null,"title":"Almost one 50 people Covid England official figures reveal","story":"Share this articleSeparate figures yesterday showed infections are rising in every age group and four-fifths of areas in England, with an even more transmissible strain of Delta thought to be to blame. AY.4.2 has spread to all but two dozen places in the country. And the country’s largest symptom-tracking surveillance study suggested daily cases have already hit 80,000, feared to be the threshold at which the epidemic becomes \u0027unstable\u0027. Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, has maintained that the country is equipped to deal with 100,000 cases per day, however. Britain is detecting some 46,791 Covid cases every day on average, official data shows, with the latest figure up 17 per cent on the same time last week.Some 54,571 people who were swabbed for the virus on October 18 tested positive. This is barely inches from the peak in mid-July when 60,763 people were found to be infected with Covid. A weekly report from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) — which has replaced Public Health England — yesterday revealed Covid cases have risen in all age groups, but are now at a record high among school children. And some 85 per cent of the 149 local authorities in England had seen a spike in infections in the week to October 17, with 12 areas recording a spike of more than 50 per cent. A total of 1,366.8 cases per 100,000 people aged 10 to 19 were recorded in the seven days to October 17, up week-on-week from 1,134.9. The rate for five to nine-year-olds is 719.2, up week-on-week from 585.0.For both age groups this is the highest weekly rate since this data was first collected in October 2020, according to the UKHSA.Case rates are continuing to rise in all age groups in England. The lowest rate is among people aged 80 and over, at 121.2, up from 115.6. Rates are also increasing in all but one region of England.Separate data from King\u0027s College London\u0027s symptom tracking study found that cases among Britons had risen by a fifth in a week to the highest level this year.It estimated 81,823 people were getting infected with the virus every day in the week ending October 16, up 17 per cent from 69,993 the week before, and nearly double the 45,000 officially reported each day. Data from the study — which is based on reports from around 750,000 users of the ZOE Covid Symptom Study app — suggests one in 63 people in the UK have symptomatic Covid. Professor Tim Spector, the epidemiologist who leads the study, warned that the UK is \u0027really in trouble\u0027 and \u0027needs to act now to prevent the situation from escalating out of control ahead of winter\u0027.Professor Spector said: \u0027With over 80,000 new cases a day the UK really is in trouble.\u0027This hasn\u0027t happened overnight, but frustratingly our calls for a more cautious approach to Covid management have gone unheeded, despite the upward trends we\u0027ve reported now for several weeks.\u0027As feared, cases have spilled over into the older age group which will certainly lead to more hospitalisations and deaths.

The Portugal playmaker Fernandes is among several United players feeling the effects of a bruising midweek Champions League contest with Atalanta.  “Games like Wednesday night are always going to bring knocks and bruises,” Solskjaer said at his pre-match press conference. “We do have two or three from that game. Bruno might be one of them that is a doubt, but he’s doing everything he can to be ready.” (PA)I can’t be completely sure, but I think he’s talking about football.“I spoke to the owners on Wednesday morning,” Jones said. “They’ve asked me to take on an interim basis, for the next two games, Crystal Palace and Chelsea at home. I’m fully focused on preparing the team as best we can to be competitive in both games.” “My ambition is to do the best I can for my football club ... I’m motivated in a completely different way to anywhere I’ve ever been, because I came to this club as a four-year-old ... I know the culture of this football club.”Belgian-based supporter Guido De Pauw, 63, is said to be in stable condition in hospital after being attacked at a service station near Drongen on his journey home from the match. Two of the five suspects who were arrested remain in custody. Guardiola appeared at his Friday press conference in a t-shirt which read ‘We’re with you, Guido’, and said: “Of course the whole club and organisation from the chairman down we are behind him and we are optimistic because in the last hours he is getting better.  “Of course he has all the support through the club and whatever they need from our club is there. We have a big, big hug for him and for all his family, and we wish that he can come back soon to the Etihad Stadium.” (PA) “Why should we compare?” he asked. “Obviously both are world-class players. Even though Ronaldo’s left foot is not bad, I would say Mo’s left foot is probably better. Cristiano may be better in the air and his right foot is probably better. Speed-wise, both are pretty quick and desperate to score goals but I’ve never really thought about that. I’m not too interested in comparing, sorry.”Arsenal’s Williamson was given the honour for last month’s big wins over North Macedonia and Luxembourg after Steph Houghton had to withdraw with an ankle injury. Houghton and reigning world player of the year Lucy Bronze remain sidelined for the upcoming matches and Wiegman wants a chance to assess all her options before she makes a decision.  “I’m not close yet,” said Wiegman. “I think Leah does very well. She plays well, she’s very good in the group so she does a very good job. But we haven’t had Steph and Lucy Bronze in our group and they’ve captained this team before. So we’ll just take a little time and, when everyone is fit, performs well, comes in the squads, then I can see how everyone relates and what’s best for the team.” England and Northern Ireland are two of three teams in their group alongside Austria that have a 100 per cent record after two qualifying matches. England beat Northern Ireland 6-0 in a friendly in February but Wiegman sees Saturday’s match as a step up.  “I expect a harder game than we had last month,” she said. “I think we’ll still be the team that will have possession lots of the time. Obviously it’s very nice to play at Wembley and to have a big crowd so we’re really looking forward to it. Northern Ireland has qualified for the Euros for the first time, which is really good. They have been in transition a little bit. I’m really excited to get to the game tomorrow.”  This will be England’s first match at Wembley since more than 70,000 fans turned up for a friendly defeat by Germany two years ago, and their first competitive game since the stadium reopened in 2007. ““I was watching the game and there was not one second where I was rubbing my hands together, I can say that,” he told reporters. “There was no reason for it. Atalanta caused United problems in the first half but even in that half, United had three clear-cut chances. Second half was a demonstration of United going for it, which can cause problems. I’m preparing the team for a tough game against a really good opponent.”Last week’s defeat at Southampton was, in Bielsa’s own words, their worst performance to date and the 66-year-old Argentinian has made it clear to his squad what he expects from them. “Commitment and not indifference, responsibility and not passing over your responsibilities. Hope and faith before disappointment,” he said. “There’s a phrase that I read not so long ago, that teams are made out of crystal. It’s difficult to make them solid but they break from one day to the other. “So we played our best game of the season against Watford and the worst against Southampton. More than whether the opponents were better or worse, teams change frequently, so what is it that allows a loss of form or for a team to recover quickly? There are groups that, in the face of difficulties, they move away, they don’t want to belong to something that’s not going through an attractive moment.  “And there’s other groups that are coming together where they belong and they make the maximum efforts, to modify the realities that affect their people, their club and their fans. And the challenge for a coach in adversity is to try and find this type of feeling.”  “Last season the message that we were sending to the players was that if they were fit they were playing - this season it is that if you are fit then you now have to prove to me that you are better than the others.”  For all the players they have jockeying for limited positions, Southampton only notched first Premier League win of the season by beating Leeds 1-0 last weekend - but Hasenhuttl said he has noticed a change in training. “I like working with these players at the moment,” he said. “We have a good mentality, there is a good atmosphere and everybody wants to work. If we have a player who is not feeling so good one day, they can get swapped out for another who is ready to work hard. This is exactly what I wanted to see.” “They were so impressive in their performances against Liverpool and Chelsea,” the Brighton manager said of Manchester City. “To pick up four points from those two matches away from home was incredible. We know the quality of the opposition - as good as anybody in the world. “The goalkeeper can hit balls behind the defensive line from within his own six-yard box, the midfield is so fluid, the false nine challenges you in terms of how you defend, the width is incredible, the workrate of the team is amazing and it looks like they are getting better and better. They’re so good. How do you prepare? A lot of head-scratching is the honest answer!” Albion currently sit fourth in the table but Potter believes there is plenty of room for improvement in his side. “We know we can improve,” he said. “That’s not to say the points will follow, because that’s the beauty of football, but we know we have got a lot of work to do. The aim is to be a top-10 club - that’s been articulated clearly and often - but that’s not to say we are there now. We need to keep fighting, we have to keep improving and we’ve got a long way to go before we get there.” Leicester City seem to be hitting their stride after a slow start to the season, something that hasn’t gone unnoticed by Frank. “Brendan and his coaching staff have done a fantastic job the last couple of years,” he added. “They have come fifth, really close to those Champions League spots, playing an entertaining style of football. They have really developed a good side that is really dangerous and they will challenge for the top four again this season. They are a top side with a top manager and top staff, and we will need to be at our absolute best to get something out of the game - which we of course believe we can.”  Frank will be without winger Yoane Wissa, who faces a few weeks on the sidelines after suffering an ankle injury.  “I am very sure at the end Watford will be safe,” he said today, when asked about his side’s chances of avoiding relegation. “Always I try to recharge the batteries of my players and they train very, very well. I am hopeful about the next match. It was much better this week because against Liverpool I met all my players two days before. “This week I work well with all my players and I think day by day they understand much better my ideas about football. Of course we make some mistakes but I think match by match we improve. It is important to improve immediately and make less mistakes as quick as possible.” Josh King is in contention to feature for Watford against his former club after returning from a knee injury but Kiko Femenia (hip) could join Francisco Sierralta, Christian Kabasele and Peter Etebo on the list of Watford’s lame and halt. “I decided to put out the side I did,” he said. “It’s my responsibility. Obviously I did it with good intentions in mind, for two main reasons. From one side, I wanted to give a chance to those players who have been working really hard but have not had much chance to play. From the other side, considering the squad we have and all the games we have to play, I wanted to rest some of the players that have played in pretty much every game. “On an artificial pitch, in weather conditions like these, I decided to rotate a lot of players. Then, we lost to a side that was better than us. It’s simple. The Bodo first team is better than the one that started the game for us.”  We’ll bring you news from the day’s managerial press conferences, training ground updates and stay across any other interesting talking points and sub-plots that arise ahead of a Premier League weekend book-ended by tonight’s match between Arsenal v Aston Villa at the Emirates and Sunday afternoon’s intriguing set-to between Manchester United and Liverpool at Old Trafford.

They were joined by Baroness Meacher, who sponsored the Bill. “Capitalism is good, capitalism creates higher wages, better skills, stronger businesses, a more global Britain,” he says. “It is through capitalism that this country has grown to provide the public services for so many of our people.” He says it has allowed the country to have “the highest wages for the lowest pay” in decades. He argues that we should be entrusting the “captains of capitalism ... the women and men who lead our businesses” with the “responsibility to act ethically and responsibly”. He says that is best done by a “code of practice that works with the grain of business rather than against it”.Fuller says the “nub” of the difference of approach between the Tories and the opposition on the issue is to do with regulation. “Our approach is not about making better regulation, it is about making better business. There are a variety of tactics that can be taken to achieve a shared objective,” Fuller says. He says the debate relates to “an exceptional time and an exceptional practice ... which remains exceptionally rare”.  Fuller then asks whether the Labour party supports ending the tactic or not – Gardiner had said earlier that the bill would not want to ban it entirely. Gardiner clarifies the bill would not ban it, but supporting members want to end it as a tactic – “as a bad practice used by disreputable employers to do the wrong thing”. “This issue is not going to go away, it certainly won’t go away with guidelines,” Newlands says. Echoing Gardiner’s argument from earlier, Newlands is making the economic case for changing fire and rehire legislation, saying that employment insecurity is a “surefire” way to “depress spending, demand and ultimately hinder economic recovery”.Lord Adonis said it would risk allowing abuse of vulnerable people: Meanwhile, crossbencher Lord Hogan-Howe spoke about having changed his mind on the issue, which he said was one that “can ide reasonable people”, adding that he now supports the Bill “in a way I wouldn’t have supported it a few years ago”. Lord Hogan-Howe said “choice” was now the main reason he supported the Bill, adding he could “only imagine the torment or hopelessness of a person who knows they’re dying” and questioned how the state or parliament could “deny iniduals the option of a controlled death”.Lord Dobbs told the House of Lords that his father and eldest brother both died of prostate cancer, while his other brother has been told he “won’t survive it” and he himself was diagnosed earlier this year. He said that he understood some people’s reservations but a law “which says myself and my loved ones must suffer in agony and without hope” is one of “utmost cruelty” and must be changed.Local shopkeepers and residents in Eastwood Road stood in silence which was broken with applause and the release of blue balloons to pay respect to the MP. James Duddridge, the MP for Rochford and Southend East, said: “It is going to be very difficult not just for the family but for the whole community.” Shadow employment rights minister, Imran Hussain, calls the tactic “nothing more than a form of legalised blackmail where all the power is in the hands of bad bosses”. “Let there be no doubt that fire and rehire is abhorrent, morally bankrupt, and a stain on our economy,” he says. He says the tactic is being employed “not by small companies” but big nationals, including Tesco and Argos, adding “many of these companies have seen bumper sales during lockdown”.Covid-19 was the third leading cause of death in both England and Wales in September, unchanged from August in England, but up from seventh in Wales. The leading cause of death in England was dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, while in Wales the leading cause was ischaemic heart disease.Baroness Meacher read out a statement from Lord Field of Birkenhead as his illness meant he was unable to take part in the assisted dying bill at second reading.

Photograph: Alan Betson The Department of Education has delayed issuing revised guidelines on whether to resume school activities such as tours, indoor sports and in-person parent-teacher meetings in light of rising Covid-19 case numbers.Officials have been examining the potential of relaxing rules to allow more school activities for several weeks.However, education partners say they were told recently that guidelines have been delayed until after mid-term when there is greater clarity on Covid-19 cases in schools and the wider community.While schools reopened in September, there are still restrictions across a range of activities.For example, school tours or excursions have been postponed or cancelled in most cases due largely to restrictions on numbers allowed on school buses.In addition, in-school activities such as parent-teacher meetings, cake sales, concerts, plays, choral recitals and many indoor sports have not been permitted for public health reasons.Rising numbers of positive cases across the population - including children - have raised doubts over whether to relax restrictions.A spokesman for the Department of Education said the safe and sustained operation of schools is a key priority of the department and public health authorities.“The evidence available from the operation of schools during Covid-19 to date shows that schools are low risk environments due to the effective implementation of infection prevention and control measures by the whole school community,” he said.Urgent reviewHowever, there have been concerns among some education partners over the rise in Covid-19 cases and the ending of routine contact tracing last month for close contacts among children in primary schools.The Irish National Teachers’ Organisation (INTO) has called for the immediate re-introduction of testing and contact tracing in primary schools due to the rising number of infections.It wants a pilot scheme for antigen testing to begin in schools and an “urgent” review on restricting the use of face coverings to children aged 13 and over.The union says the cessation of routine testing and contact tracing in primary schools from September 27th was “premature”.“This change in policy last month, which was challenged by this union, was informed by a view at the time that further relaxation of public-health measures was on the cards,” it said.A spokesman for the department said the response to confirmed cases or outbreaks of Covid-19 in the community or in a school is led and managed by the HSE. “All decisions as to appropriate actions following a confirmed case or outbreak will be made by HSE Public Health,” he said.In cases where there are multiple cases in a class or school, the spokesman said public health authorities engage closely with inidual schools. “The department’s advice to schools is to follow public health advice at all times. The department has always been guided by public health advice in relation to appropriate Covid-19 infection prevention and control measures in place in schools.

Video: ReutersMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney with UK prime minister Boris Johnson speaking with Catholic Primate of All Ireland Archbishop Eamon Martin following a service to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland at St Patrick’s Cathedral in Armagh yesterday. Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA The children shone amid a confession of bad report cards from the sorrowful adults. After a hundred years of tribal suspicion and violent misunderstanding, Ireland’s leading men of the cloth publicly admitted on Thursday that their churches did not do enough during the worst of times to encourage and nurture peace. They should have tried harder to heal the wounds between their respective communities. They should have looked beyond factional mindsets and reached out.“Must do better” was their verdict on themselves. “Must try harder.”It’s only taken them a century, but at least it’s a start.The mere idea of a commemorative event in Northern Ireland to mark the incendiary partitioning of the island in 1921 is enough to spark apoplexy among a sizeable portion of the population – North and South. To invite the British monarch to attend, along with her UK political representatives in the North, is like a red, white and blue rag to a nationalist bull.But only if they were aware of this ecumenical church service happening in the first place. Had President Michael D Higgins not turned down an invitation to attend – the political connotations did not sit well with him – the event would probably have passed off quietly and faded from the public consciousness in no time.Contentious milestoneThe powers that be in Northern Ireland have not been making much of a fuss about this contentious milestone in the North’s turbulent past. The controversy over Mr Higgins’s polite but unexpected decision hurled it into the headlines.Observing the diplomatic niceties saw Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney representing the Irish Government in St Patrick’s Church of Ireland cathedral with chief whip Jack Chambers taking one for the Fianna Fáil team by accompanying his Coalition colleague to the service.And then, on the day before the five leaders of the main Christian churches were due to stand together at a religious service of “Reflection and Hope” on the centenary of Northern Ireland’s difficult birth, Queen Elizabeth retired from the fray for medical reasons.Never fear Boris is here. News that the UK prime minister (whose main pronouncements on matters Northern Irish tend to involve a wheeze to build a tunnel under the sea to Scotland) would be heading to the ceremony broke before the official communication from Buckingham Palace about the queen’s reluctant withdrawal from it. But that was probably to do with bad timing.“There is no queen but the court jester is still flying in” remarked one observer outside the cathedral.There was a sense of deep disappointment at her majesty’s unfortunate absence from many of the organisers. “I’m sure her majesty will be following every minute of the service at home,” said a local volunteer.Despite the shadow of controversy hanging over the occasion, a quick perusal of the order of service booklet and a read through the various reflections and prayers did not yield anything which could even remotely annoy anyone. Then again, one of the hymns, based on a psalm, was set to an “Irish traditional melody: Londonderry Air”.That set few noses out of joint.This was a straightforward religious service, with uplifting readings and thoughtful, sometimes touching, contributions from the two most reverends, Eamon Martin, Catholic Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All-Ireland and John McDowell, the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland), the one Right Reverend (David Bruce, Moderator of the Presbyterian Church) and the one Very Reverend (Ivan Patterson, president of the Irish Council of Churches). Not forgetting the Reverend Dr Sahr Yambasu, president of the Methodist Church in Ireland, who delivered the sermon.And a great ecclesiastical soundtrack. Wonderful hymns, thumping organ music and celestial blasts from a concert harp.When the socially distanced congregation representing all strands and strains of people was in place, the VIPs arrived. Coveney and his Fianna Fáil consort first.“Unfortunately the doctors have advised they’re fit to travel,” texted a Government politician watching the scene from his office in Leinster House.“Is that Mr Coveney’s son?” asked one of the press people from the Methodist Church. “No, that’s Jack Chambers, the Government chief whip.”Next up the aisle (not for the first time) came Boris Johnson. When he got out of his car, a female aide rushed over and stuffed a lanyard back in his pocket while swiftly tucking in his shirt.He made his stately progress towards his place on the red velvet cushioned pews in the front, across the way from the Irish politicians. And there it was – no doubt greeted with cries of vindication across the land and a wee smile from Michael D – a small but very visible union flag on the prime minister’s black face mask.That little flagIn what was a very, very carefully planned, non-political event, that little flag stuck out like a sore thumb.Clearly, nobody showed Boris the memo about “no emblems in the workplace”. That directive is a familiar one to workers in Northern Ireland.Last to arrive was the queen’s stand-in: Nicholas James Alexander, the seventh Earl of Caledon and Lord Lieutenant of Armagh. He got a little pew all to himself nearest the altar. Had the President been there, he would have been given one too, presumably.The ancient cathedral was decorated with magnificent floral arrangements. All the flowers – roses, gladioli, carnations – were white, for peace. Sunlight streamed though the stained glass windows, although it was a bitterly cold morning outside on the hilltop.“There is a future for tomorrow, so let’s begin today,” sang the children’s choir.“We all breathe the same air. We all walk under the same tree,” read a schoolgirl. “I hope for peace and harmony on this, our shared island.”The children gave hope and as they spoke powerfully about their hopes for the future.Lovely church serviceIf there hadn’t been such a palaver over the description of the ceremony and the event it tastefully and respectfully strove to mark, it would have been just another well-meaning, lovely church service.It took just over an hour, and was broadcast live on RTÉ and the BBC, with the British transmission starting earlier and running on longer than the Irish version.After the final blessing, the young people carried “The Light of Hope” from the cathedral followed by the queen’s representative, the politicians and the five clergymen.Johnson stopped along the way to talk to people. This meant that Coveney, walking a number of paces behind, had to do the same. They finally met and bumped elbows at the main door, exchanging a some stilted pleasantries in the process. But there seemed to be a certain chilliness to the encounter. And there were no displays of bonhomie in the courtyard either.It was all rather businesslike, those brief days of the Leo-Boris Brexit bromance a distant memory. They didn’t hang around for long afterwards either. Johnson spoke briefly to some of the youngsters outside in the line: “Are you freezing?” Kids: “They gave us a break.” Boris: “Did you have a drink?” But the politicians from Northern Ireland, as ever, stacked up and circled the microphones before being called in for their verdicts. If St Patrick’s is high on a hilltop, its position was nothing compared to the very conciliatory stance taken on the high ground by the DUP and UUP leaders.What was all the fuss about, they asked? “Perhaps the President will have the opportunity to actually sit down and watch this service, and perhaps see what it was truly about,” Jeffrey Donaldson said.“End Partition Now” tweeted Sinn Féin’s Michelle O’Neill, who did not attend to mark its beginning.

Photo: Gareth ChaneyCollinsNightclubs and most music venues will open their doors for the first time since March 2020 on Friday night. The latest phase of easing Covid-19 restrictions will proceed today despite a marked deterioration in the trajectory of the disease over the past fortnight. With some protective measures remaining in place, here’s everything you need to know about what to expect if you are planning on going out tonight.Q. What restrictions are being loosened from today?Nightclubs and most music venues will effectively be able to operate at full capacity from this evening having been closed for nearly 600 days. Live music venues can allow up to 1,500 people standing at events, in addition to full seating capacity.Q. Do I have to wear a mask in a nightclub?People will be asked to wear masks when they are not eating, drinking or dancing. Queuing for drinks at bars and counters is allowed but beverages must be consumed elsewhere on the premises.Q. Will I need to be vaccinated to attend a nightclublive music event?The digital Covid-19 pass will continue to be required for indoor hospitality and events. Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said hospitality businesses would need to strictly follow requirements to ask customers for vaccination certificates. Q. What time will the venues stay open until?Nightclubs will be able to remain open late depending on the license of the inidual premises. The 11.30pm curfew for pubs will also be scrapped. Q. Have all restrictions on restaurantspubs been lifted then?Not quite. Hospitality settings can have multiple table bookings with a maximum of 10 adults per table, as well as five people aged under 18.People can queue at the bar, but they must be socially distanced, and must then return to their table.The guidelines also state physical distancing of at least one metre is considered “best practice” between tables. Q. Do I need to book a ticket if I want to go to a nightclub tonight? Some venues - particularly those with live music - have sold or issued tickets so that customers can book ahead and buy tickets. Other venues are accepting walk-ins as normal.Q. What about other changes to restrictions - are there capacity limits for weddings?Religious services and weddings can proceed without capacity limits but with all other protective measures remaining in place. Q. Will there be a restriction on the numbers allowed at large outdoor events such as concerts or GAA matches?Fixed capacity limits will no longer apply for outdoor events. Covid-19 passes will also not be needed. However, the guidelines state that organisers of indoor and outdoor group activities should ensure that appropriate protective measures are in place. Q. What about the return to workplaces?The full return to offices is being delayed until next spring in response to rising Covid-19 cases, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has said.Employers should facilitate people working from home, he said, adding that if there are people who really wanted to return to the office, that should be facilitated too “if they can be in an office on their own or socially distanced from other people”.Otherwise, the return to workplaces will continue on a “phased and cautious basis” for “specific business requirements” only.Q. Are there any changes to international travel?The requirements for proof of vaccination, immunity or a negative PCR test will remain in place for international travellers. People will also still be required to fill out a passenger locator form. However, the Government said the mandatory hotel quarantine system for arrivals from certain countries was no longer considered necessary and would be wound down. Mandatory home quarantine requirements will also be removed.Q. When will all remaining Covid-19 restrictions be lifted?The latest recommendations from Nphet to Government ministers said restrictions such as mask wearing and social distancing must remain in place until February 2022.Speaking earlier this week, Mr Varadkar said: “The pandemic isn’t over yet. We’re going to have to get through at least another winter before we can say it’s behind us.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"vigilance needed as venues reopen amid reports of drink spiking charity","story":"Nightclub revellers and staff urged to be vigilant as venues reopen this weekend amid a number of reports of drink spikingNightclub revellers and staff have been urged to be vigilant as venues reopen this weekend amid a number of reports of drink spiking.A number of Munster Technological University (MTU) students in Co Kerry were reportedly spiked during freshers’ week last week, while police in the North are appealing for information about a similar spate of incidents in Derry in recent days.Síona Cahill, former president of the Union of Students in Ireland and a board member for the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, said drink spiking was nothing new but there had been “some level of growth in it” in recent years.“Ahead of the weekend, people are absolutely delighted, so excited to get back on to the dance floor, but unfortunately there are a limited number of people who want to take advantage of that,” she warned.“Obviously there should be a zero tolerance attitude to any kind of behaviour like that in our nightclubs, in our friend groups or anywhere else.”Ms Cahill said “a complicating factor” would be a generation of 18- and 19-year-olds going to nightclubs this weekend who have no experience of what they are like.“It is important that we take that into account,” she said.“The way people behave in a nightclub is different.”While reported incidents of spiking of drinks is “limited” it is “something that we need to be vigilant about, both as young people and people going out for a dance this weekend but also for the staff who are managing those areas,” she added.Ms Cahill also cautioned that it can happen at private parties and other unregulated spaces.“It is really important straight off the bat that we don’t say to women ‘don’t get spiked on a night out’.“It is not the women’s responsibility not to get spiked, there is very clearly a broader society conversation around consent and longer term prevention and around matters like this, be it in nightclubs or anywhere else.”Organisations like the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre are “trying to open up the conversation with people of all genders and all ages on language of consent and how we engage with each other on a night out,” she said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"guidelines for nightclubs yet to be published ahead of reopening tonight","story":"Nightclubs and music venues have been closed for 585 days. File photograph: iStockWith only hours to go before the reopening of nightclubs and music venues, the Government has yet to publish guidelines for operating the premises that were agreed with the hospitality industry. Representatives of the sector were told on Thursday night that guidelines for nightclubs and live music venues would be available within a short period of time. However, while guidelines were issued for the restaurant sector on Thursday night, the publication of the advice and rules for the late-night entertainment sector were delayed, initially until Friday morning, and now until Friday afternoon. Officials from the Department of Tourism told representatives that they were still working on completing guidelines but then said on Friday that there would be delays. Explaining the delay, a Government source said that regulations were required and were being “worked on” at the present time.There was some suggestion that some legal issues had been raised by the Department of An Taoiseach, raising the possibility that regulations might be required to give effect to some of the changes. Dónal O’Keeffe from the Licensed Vintners Association, which represents the trade in the Dublin area, speaking at mid-afternoon on Friday, said it was only hours before the nightclubs and music venues reopened after being closed for 585 days. “It is very frustrating that we do not have the guidelines and will have to open tonight operating on the basis of what has been leaked to the media,” he said. Under the proposals put forward by officials in the Department of Tourism, nightclubs and most music venues in the State will effectively operate at full capacity when they reopen on Friday night.Minister for Arts and Tourism Catherine Martin confirmed on Thursday night that 1,500 people will be allowed to stand at indoor music venues, with the remaining members of the audience sitting. In effect, it means that most music venues in the country - with the exception of a small number such as the 3 Arena and the INEC in Killarney - will be allowed to run full-standing events. In addition, nightclubs will also open with 100 per cent capacity, in essence eliminating social distancing protocols in those venues, except when ordering drinks at the bar. In that respect, bar service will be allowed in all hospitality for the first time since restrictions were introduced. Patrons will be allowed to queue at the bar while maintaining social distance, and order drinks, but must then return to their seats after collecting the order. It was also agreed on Thursday that all hospitality venues can have multiple table bookings with a maximum number of 10 people per table. The situation in pubs and restaurants is a little different as social distancing will remain, reducing their capacity to between 70 and 90 per cent, depending on the layout.

It\u0027s a bit soon to start speculating about the outcome of this, let alone other jobs which aren\u0027t actually vacant.Senior corporation sources have expressed frustration at the speculation. However, the broadcaster would not confirm on Thursday night whether an inquiry would be launched into the leaked information. According to , Sopel, who has announced that he will be moving back to the UK, will be in the frame for the political editor position should Kuenssberg move on. He would be replaced by Sarah Smith, the current BBC Scotland editor, it has been reported, leaving her position vacant.  Another role that could be left empty is that currently held by Huw Edwards, who is reportedly considering his future. But one understood not to be under discussion is that of Andrew Marr, with inside information suggesting he will be kept in place for royal coverage in the event of the Queen\u0027s death.If Kuenssberg moves to the Today programme, the flagship Radio 4 current affairs show will have a roster of six presenters.She became the BBC\u0027s first female political editor in 2015 and has covered two elections and the Brexit referendum. Accusations of bias led to a petition for her removal from the role over coverage of Jeremy Corbyn, and it was reported that she required a bodyguard during the 2017 election. More from NewsPolitics latest news: Covid hospital admissions ‘unlikely’ to match previous peaks, predicts SageBuckingham Palace accused of not giving complete picture about Queen’s healthEye problems in old age could be treated with daily dose of ProzacAli Harbi Ali appears at Old Bailey from Belmarsh prison‘I\u0026#39ve trained with Prince Harry, lost my legs in Helmand – now I’m on course to be a bobsleigh world champion’Watch: Largest triceratops dinosaur skeleton sells for £5.6mMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"labours instincts masks step people needs attract","story":"I’m taking credit for it, whether that’s fair or not. Yesterday, the Leader of the House, Jacob Rees-Mogg, responded to Labour criticism of Conservative MPs not wearing masks in the Commons chamber by gleefully pointing out his opponents’ hypocrisy: when Labour MPs were pictured at their own conference, they were seen maskless.I tweeted exactly that observation at the time, my effort being retweeted a few hundred times, including by a few Tory MPs. So, you’re welcome, Jacob.It’s all just so tiresome. Are we really so bereft of issues to debate that our politicians have to play virtuous one-upmanship over the wearing of masks? It’s almost as dull as the annual poppy wars, in which the wearing or not wearing of a poppy is seen as evidence either of jingoistic fanaticism or naïve, unpatriotic pacifism.But Labour’s criticism, and its MPs’ decision to wear masks in the chamber even though such a gesture is not legally required, says something about a section of society’s attitudes to authority. True, there are many who genuinely believe that mask wearing is making a significant contribution to halting the spread of Covid-19, and those people see the example set by Labour MPs as worthy, and the refusal by Conservative MPs to follow suit as irresponsible.But there are others who simply relish the imposition by the state of rules and regulations to control citizens’ behaviour. Shortly after social distancing on board Scottish trains was ended, I sat opposite a young man on a train from Pitlochry to Glasgow. I was wearing a mask (still legally required up here) but this didn’t reassure my fellow passenger, who immediately objected to my sitting at a table intended for four people.Either he selfishly wanted the whole table to himself, or he wrongly believed social distancing was still in effect. But I detected more than simply an ignorance of the changed rules: this was someone who regretted the gradual relaxation of the rules, who would be more comfortable with the restrictions that had previously been enforced, mandating two metre distancing and fining people 200 quid if they looked at anyone straight in the eyes.To be fair, it could be that my fellow passenger was simply genuinely concerned about catching the virus. But there’s no doubt that there are plenty of people around who embraced social distancing and other safety rules, rather than simply accepting them reluctantly as a necessary evil.Maybe it’s just me but I think the latter attitude is by far the healthier. Whenever I’m travelling southwards, I look forward to my train’s arrival in Carlisle where Nicola Sturgeon’s mask mandate no longer applies and I can breathe the free air of England. It’s sensible to respect and observe the law, but just as sensible to celebrate when the law no longer forces you to wear something as damned uncomfortable and claustrophobic as a mask. Labour MPs, it would seem, fall culturally into the category of wishing there were more rules around to restrict our freedom. Presumably, if they’re critical of MPs who are legally choosing not to wear a mask in the chamber, then they believe that such mask wearing should be made legally obligatory. Yet none of them seem to want to press that point. Most strange.Could it be that they are simply trying to score political points by emphasising the uncaring, selfish approach of their opponents? One would hope not. But Rees-Mogg’s (and my) point about Labour MPs choosing to exercise their rights not to wear a mask during their own conference, when many of them knew they would be pictured on TV applauding their leader’s speech to delegates, remains valid. Why was it safe to go commando, as it were, in the conference hall but not in the Commons?It can’t be that Labour fears Tory MPs are presenting a poor example to gullible viewers who watch Prime Minister’s Questions each week for lifestyle tips those same viewers would also have been tuning into the Brighton conference and would have observed a very different example of behaviour.We are left with the unpalatable conclusion that Labour, having been placed at almost every turn on the backfoot during the pandemic, and having failed to make any political headway against Boris Johnson in that time, is still plugging away, more in hope than in expectation, at the idea that voters will at last buy into their mindset that Tories are somehow morally derelict, unlike the saintly Labour Party.I mean, it’s a view. And since nothing else – including this strategy, it has to be said – seems to be working, it’s as well to flog a dead horse as to say nothing at all. If the public really were appalled by Tory MPs not wearing masks in the chamber, if they really thought that Labour were fighting a lonely battle to beat the virus using a suitably ostentatious combination of paper and elastic, wouldn’t the polls suggest that voters are rewarding this strategy?The danger is that voters will see the chamber ided equally between mask-wearers and non-wearers and will, accurately, conclude that everyone is making a political point. The question is whether those viewers naturally yearn for the days of mask mandates or instead prefer the freedom to decide for themselves how best to protect themselves and others. Labour might discover, not for the first time, that its own instincts are out of step with the people it needs to attract. More from NewsPolitics latest news: Covid hospital admissions ‘unlikely’ to match previous peaks, predicts SageBuckingham Palace accused of not giving complete picture about Queen’s healthEye problems in old age could be treated with daily dose of ProzacAli Harbi Ali appears at Old Bailey from Belmarsh prison‘I\u0026#39ve trained with Prince Harry, lost my legs in Helmand – now I’m on course to be a bobsleigh world champion’Watch: Largest triceratops dinosaur skeleton sells for £5.6mMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph weekly news quiz much sleep should get night delay","story":"In the week that saw the leader of the NHS Confederation warn that ministers must immediately enforce Plan B coronavirus restrictions or risk stumbling into a winter crisis, The \u0027s news quiz is here to find out how closely you have been paying attention to the headlines.As the UK and New Zealand agreed to a new trade deal, imports of which variety of wine could get cheaper?And according to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), what was the most popular girls\u0027 name and most popular boys\u0027 name in England and Wales in 2020?If you\u0027ve been reading this week\u0027s  Front Page newsletters you will have come across all of the answers to the quiz.

Follow Covid news - live: NHS chiefs urge government to implement winter ‘plan B’Figures show that the number of people testing positive for coronavirus currently stands at more than 40,000 per day. Hospital admission numbers are still below levels seen last autumn, although they are rising gradually.According to Professor Neil Ferguson, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) from Imperial College London, there are “a number of reasons” why the UK currently has higher infection levels than many other European countries.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the professor suggested that the UK has “lower functional immunity in our population than most other western European countries” for a number of reasons.According to Professor Ferguson these reasons include the vaccine rollout starting earlier in the UK than elsewhere and the fact that “we relied more on the AstraZeneca vaccine”.There are other suggestions that less mask wearing, more relaxed rules around mixing and a slowing vaccine rollout could also be behind the surge in figures. But why exactly are cases of Covid rising in the UK?Waning immunity?The UK was one of the fastest countries in the world to rollout the Covid-19 vaccine, meaning that immunity of some of those who were first vaccinated may be lower now.A study of Covid test results of vaccinated people who logged their symptoms in an app, suggested that after about five or six months, the protection against catching the virus wanes significantly.Join our new commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesView  comments"},{"url":null,"title":"brits vouchers discounts eating smaller","story":"Brits to get vouchers and discounts for eating smaller portions on government-backed appUnder plans to curb obesity rates, people will be offered incentives for getting active and eating better, including gym passes, clothes or food vouchers and discounts for shops, cinema or theme park ticketsPeople will be offered discounts in shopsthey eat more healthy food under a new Government pilot Image: Getty Images iStockphotoByLizzy BuchanDeputy Online Political Editor:,  Oct | commentsBrits will get shop discounts and gym vouchers for increasing their step count and eating smaller portions under a new Government pilot. Under plans to curb obesity rates, people will be offered incentives for getting active and eating better, including gym passes, clothes or food vouchers and discounts for shops, cinema or theme park tickets. Users of a new app will wear a device on their wrists which offers health advice, such as increasing their step count, eating more fruit and vegetables and decreasing portion size. The scheme will be piloted in England in January, backed by a £ million Government pot to fund incentives. Obesity-related illnesses cost the NHS £ billion per year, and people who are signicantly overweight have been disproportionately affected by Covid-, according to the Department for Health and Social Care . Boris Johnson admitted he had been too fat when he was hospitalised with Covid- last year and went on a health kick to shed the pounds.  He had previously opposed sin taxes and nannying by the Government over the nationaposs waistlines. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: I want to ensure weaposre doing as much as we can to tackle health disparities across the country, and this new pilot will pave the way for developing innovative ways to improve the lives of iniduals, and also help to reduce strain on the NHS. But Labour accused the Government of tinkering around the edges after pushing poorer families towards cheaper, less healthy foods by cutting Universal Credit. Shadow health minister Alex Norris told the Commons: We are not going to argue against measures that attempt to help our public improve their health, but like the obesity strategy that precedes this latest pilot, this is tinkering around the edges. He added: Tackling obesity is about tackling poverty. You are twice as likely to be obese in the poorest communities as you are in the best off. Your food choices, your exercise choices, your time.Why does this not feature at the heart of the Governmentaposs plans to tackle this scourge  Letaposs be very clear: whatever this pilot achieves, whatever the obesity strategy achieves, they will all get knocked into cocked hat by the £ a week cut to Universal Credit. This will push millions of people into cheaper, less healthy alternatives. Vaccines minister Maggie Throup said the Government had committed £ million to tackle obesity and pointed to existing policies like the soft drinks levy. She added: I think it is important that we realise that lots of dferent measures have already been put in place. This is not tinkering at the edges at all.

That means people would be eligible for a maximum of £, the Green Party said, to help them cope with rises in the cost of living. It would be funded by a one-off, £billion windfall tax on all landlords of privately-rented homes - charging % of the value of their land. This is not the same as the value of the property itself, and can be less, but further figures were not immediately available. The co-leaders were due to announce the policy in their first speech to the Green Party conference this afternoon.  I comes after the energy price cap was hiked by £ on October , with another larger hike expected in April and energy firms pushing for a third hike in the middle of winter. Mr Ramsay said: “It’s a costed proposal to be funded from a one-off % land-value tax on residential landlord properties. “This proposal is about keeping households from spiralling into fuel poverty, it’s about keeping people safe. “It’s about the state responding to market failure. It’s about human dignity. “Our proposal is what government should be doing to show leadership. It’s an issue which shows how climate justice and social justice go hand in hand - something they just don’t get. It’s also just a bridge to get us to the tough work of a real, Green New Deal.” Green Party officials believe the scheme - essentially a form of universal basic income - could be a “bridge” to their pledge to invest £billion a year in a Green New Deal. The party has pledged to cut UK carbon emissions to net zero by , two decades earlier than the government’s current pledge. Ms Denyer was expected to say in the joint speech: “People have grown tired of choosing the ‘least worst’ option. Of being patronised, ignored and told what to think. We are tired of a Tory government playing ide and rule. Tired of out of touch policies which ride roughshod over people. Tired of politics which amount to little more than an old boys club serving the interests of its pals. We need better - we demand better. We see none of it from an official opposition that fails the public, ignores the votes of its own members, and can’t take a stand on the biggest issues of the day. We have the policy - and the public is with us. We have ambition - and with your support we can fulfil that ambition.” Comment MORE ON Conservative PartyGreen PartyFuel povertyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He was later made a Crossbench peer in the House of Lords, which is today debating a Bill that will enable terminally ill adults to legally seek assistance to end their lives. Peers heard Lord Field - who campaigned against bereavement benefit cuts as chairman of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee - was unable to attend today’s debate, having spent time recently in a hospice. Crossbench peer Baroness Meacher, who is leading the Bill, said: “Our colleague Lord Field of Birkenhead, who is dying, asked me to read out a short statement.” The statement from Lord Field said: “I’ve just spent a period in a hospice and I’m not well enough to participate in today’s debate. If I had been, I would have spoken strongly in favour of the second reading [of the Bill]. “I changed my mind on assisted dying when an MP friend was dying of cancer and wanted to die early, before the full horror effects set in, but was denied this opportunity. A major argument against the Bill is unfounded. It is thought by some the culture would change and people would be pressured into ending their lives. Do you support assisted dying  Join the debate in the Commons below.  The numbers of assisted deaths in the US and Australia remains very low, under %, and a former Supreme Court judge in Victoria, Australia, about pressure from relatives, said: ’It just hasn’t been an issue’. I hope the House will today vote for the Assisted Dying Bill. Lord Field was MP for Birkenhead on Merseyside from  to , making him one of the longest-serving MPs in the Commons.Born to a Tory labourer and teaching assistant during the Second World War, he was briefly a member of the Young Conservatives before joiningLabourfor most of his le.He first stood unsuccessfully for Parliament in South Buckinghamshire in  when he was . He did not make another run for Parliament for  years,  of which he spent as director of the Child Poverty Action Group. After being elected in  Lord Field became Michael Footaposs education spokesman and claimed he led the campaign against the Trotskyist group Militant on Merseyside. He was briefly a welfare reform minister underTony Blairin  with the job of thinking the unthinkable. But he quit after barely a year in office over falling out with the PM.Later he advised the Tory-Lib Dem Coalition on welfare reform. leading an independent review into poverty in .From  he chaired the Work and Pensions Committee, where he became a leading critic of Tory benefit cuts, disability tests and errors inUniversal Credit. He was only of the only Brexiteer MPs in theLabourParty. In he quit the Labour whip,saying the party was increasingly seen as racist over the anti-Semitism scandal.He also slammed a culture of intolerance, nastiness and intimidation among local members, weeks after he lost a no confidence vote by local members.

The Assisted Dying Bill, tabled by Baroness Meacher, proposes that only terminally ill patients with full mental capacity, and are not expected to live more than six months would be eligible to apply for an assisted death. Campaigners argue that a change in the law would give those at the end of their lives greater control over how and when they die. Heartbroken Tory peer Michael Forsyth admitted he will back the bill after his dying father changed his mind. Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, told BBC Radio : “Just before he died I went to see him and said aposIaposm so sorry, dad, youaposre in this positionapos, and he completely took me aback by saying aposwell, youaposre to blame, because you and others have consistently voted against the right to die, I would like to be relieved of this, they canapost relieve the pain and I am in this position because of folk like you.”  However opponents, including many religious leaders, warned that it could leave vulnerable people exposed to unwanted pressure. The Archbishop, the Most Rev Justin Welby, told the BBC that although the safeguards in the legislation were stronger than in previous attempts to change the law, they still did not go far enough. What we want is assisted living, not assisted dying. “There is no dference between us in compassion.” The topic is being debated today in Parliament for the first time in six years. Previous attempts to introduce similar laws have all been defeated. Dame Prue Leith has backed the bill and slammed critics of “scaremongering” families. Writing in the , she said: “Opponents to the Bill fear that grasping children will coerce dying parents to get their doctors to see them off so they can inherit. If someone is going to die within six months anyway, which must be the case to qualy for assistance to die, why would anyone risk prosecution to get the money a few months earlier  This is despite her son, Tory MP Danny Kruger campaigning against the change in law. Mr Kruger set up the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Dying Well. Mr Johnson is not expected to back the plans and it is unlikely to become law without government support.

The Health Secretary made the claim at a No press conference last night, despite deaths hitting  in the last week.One Labour MP said it showed a sickening disregard for all the lives being lost.But Boris Johnsonaposs official spokesman said today: He was simply pointing out that on a purely factual basis the number of deaths per day is signicantly lower than we have seen at the peak, when we didn’t have the protection of our vaccine programme, and the greater treatment. Told the Health Secretary was not, in fact, doing that, Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman replied: Like I say, every death is clearly a tragedy. It is factually accurate that deaths are signicantly lower thanks to our vaccine rollout.  Askedthe Prime Minister agreed with Mr Javid, the spokesman said: Every single death that’s taken place during this pandemic is a tragedy. And the government continues to do everything possible to protect lives and take action where necessary to ensure lives are protected. And of course protect livelihoods as well and we’ll continue to do so. Mr Javid made the comment last night as he warned Covid cases could soon top , a day. He said: The NHS is performing with distinction, and I’d like to thank everyone who’s working so hard to keep us safe. And we’ll do what it takes to make sure that this pressure doesn’t become unsustainable and that we don’t allow the NHS to become overwhelmed. Deaths remain mercully low, but they are still sadly over  a day. This pandemic is not over.  Thanks to the vaccination programme, yes, the link between cases and hospitalisations and deaths has signicantly weakened, but it’s not broken. So we must all remember that this virus will be with us for the long term, and that it remains a threat. UK deaths within  days of a positive test reached a peak of more than , a day at the height of the second wave. Shadow health minister Justin Madders tweeted last night: Since the start of September there have been , deaths from covid.That is more than the total deaths for April, May, June, July and August combined. That is not mercully low Sajid Javid.Labour MP Richard Burgon added: Sajid Javid just described Covid deaths as mercully low. Current daily Covid death figures are equivalent to over , deaths per year. This shows a sickening disregard for all the lives being lost. Lobby Akinnola, spokesperson for Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice said: The health secretary has a track record of flippantly causing hurt to those of us who lost loved ones, whether it be implying our loved ones cowered from the virus or the idea that newly , loved ones losing their lives each week is mercully low. Perhapshe would at long last meet with us he could have it explained exactly why his words were in such poor taste  “A long time ago experts suggested , deaths would be a good outcome but here we are,  deaths a week and over , dead with the virus - in what world is this mercully low  “The only mercy many of us have received were NHS staff helping us say good bye to our loved ones. “Sajid Javid needs to choose his words more carefully, perhaps he could start by saying he will now implement a plan B to save lives and will meet with us to learn the lessons from our loved ones losses  Mr Javid and No refused to implement Plan B, which would see compulsory masks and vaccine passports in some spaces, despite NHS chiefs begging for action now. No admitted the NHS faces a very challenging winter but claimed it is not under signicant pressure yet. A spokesman also refused to say how many deaths it might take to kick in Plan B. “We don’t put a specic threshold on a particular metric because things need to be looked at in the round, focusing too much on one particular metric would be unhelpful and can be misleading in some circumstances, he said. But Carol Popplestone of the Royal College of Nursing said: The pressure on services is already unsafe and unsustainable and is heading in one clear direction. Denying the problem does not help patients nor staff.  “Next week’s Budget is a chance for government to put both long and short-term investment into health and care services.”But Mr Javid warned restrictions are more likely toduring Christmaspeople fail to wear masks when appropriate. That is despite many Tory MPs not wearing masks in the Commons chamber. On reports household mixing could be restricted under a Plan C, a No spokesman said: Neither ministers nor officials are working on those proposals, that’s not accurate. You’ve seen Plan B… that is what we would move to as a next steprequired.

Doctors accused ministers of being wilfully negligent by failing to implement Covid Plan B, which would see theof masks, working from home and use of vaccine passports.Health Secretary Sajid Javid claimed that the NHS was facing a sustainable level of pressure as the winter approaches and said further curbs would not be brought in at the moment.But he raised the threat of new restrictions before Christmaspeople didnapost get their booster jabs. It comes as Cabinet Office officials were said to be discussing plans to curb household mixing - which could form part of a “Plan C” -booster jabs donapost bring the virus under control.  Health Minister Ed Argar said plan C was not being actively considered and insisted current measures are working. Boris Johnson insisted that Government was sticking with its winter Covid plan despite the high number of infections. Speaking during a visit to a school in County Antrim, the Prime Minister said: The numbers of infections are high but weaposre within the parameters of what the predictions were. We are continuing with the plan we set out in July. We are watching the numbers very carefully every day, he said. The numbers of infections are high but we are within the parameters of what the predictions were, what Spi-Mand the others said we would be at this stage given the steps we are taking. We are sticking with our plan. But thereaposs an almighty row brewing over whether the Government is on course to repeat last yearaposs mistakes by taking lockdown measures too late in the face of spiralling infections. Hereaposs what we know about the plans to battle the virus this winter.  What is the Covid winter plan  The Government published a blueprint on how it intends to battle Covid over the colder months in September. The UK is currently following Plan A, which relies on booster jabs for the over-s and other vulnerable groups, as well as jabs to  to -year-olds to keep the virus at bay. It also advises people to wear masks in enclosed spaces, although it is not mandatory. But there are mounting fears that the booster programme is moving too slowly, with reports of chaotic rollouts for in care homes. And infections have been on the rise, with , cases as of am on Wednesday. Hospital admissions stand at  on average per day over the last seven days, up from  a week earlier, a rise of %. Scientic experts have warned that the UK is probably already close to , cases a day. The worrying figures have prompted calls for the Government to do more to curb the spread of the virus.  What is aposPlan Bapos  The -page Winter plan contains a list of tougher measures known as Plan B, which will be deployedthe NHS in England comes under unsustainable pressure. Masks would become mandatory in certain settings, and vaccine passports would be made a legal requirement for nightclubs, outdoor festivals and football matches. Brits could be ordered to work from home againthey can, and there will be public information campaigns to communicate the change of risk to the public. What needs to happen to move to aposPlan Bapos  The Government has refused to say explicitly - but we can take some educated guesses. The aim of the Covid winter plan is to ensure the NHS does not come under unsustainable pressure. This means keeping a close eye on the number of people being hospitalised with the virus, as well as whether the link between infections and hospitalisations remains weak. Vaccine efficacy is also key as the success of the UKaposs vaccine rollout has been crucial to easing Covid restrictions. The presence of any deadly new iants is also a key factor, so ministers are keeping a close eye on a new strain called AY.., which some are calling Delta Plus.Plan B might not all be imposed at onceministers do hit go on the plan. Boris Johnson previously described it as a number of dferent shots in the lockercases started rising. What is aposPlan Capos - and will household mixing be banned  Cabinet Office officials are said to be discussing a ban on household mixing before Christmasboosters fail to bring the virus under control. Health Minister Edward Argar said the plan wasnapost being actively considered but the Government would always look at ways to prevent the virus spiralling out of control. But a Whitehall source told the : The focus is very much on measures that can be taken without a major economic impact, so keeping shops, pubs and restaurants open but looking at other ways to reduce the risks.” Downing Street insisted neither ministers or officials are working on those proposals and there were no plans to move to Plan B at the moment. The national ban on indoor meet-ups was lted on May  after being in place for the last lockdown. It remained in place after shops and pubs reopened as experts suggested people were more likely to ignore social distancing guidancethey are at home with their friends and loved ones. What about foreign travel  Rules around international travel have just been relaxed, with the old traffic light rules scrapped and replaced with a single red list. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has also announced that day  PCR tests can be replaced with cheaper lateral flows from next week, to make holidays cheaper for families. None of this gives a sense that the Government is planning to scrap foreign travel again and there is no mention of ending overseas travel in the winter plan. Will there be another lockdown  Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was the latest top Tory to rule out ato a national lockdown. Boris Johnson is desperate to avoid a lockdown - and it would only ever be imposed as a last resort due to the widespread disruption to peopleaposs lives. Working from home is one of the big levers the Government can pull to reduce the spread of the virus, as well as banning household mixing. It is likely that these measures would be imposed before the Government even considered a full lockdown. And remember - we didnapost have the vaccine last winter, which is the best protection we have against the virus.

Chloe Boulos, , from Essex, says she and her partner were due to fly home Thursday, but they were told by their airline the flight had been cancelled only a few hours before it was scheduled to depart.  She said they were awaiting an update and hoped to fly on Friday. It has definitely ruined the last day as weaposve just spent all day checking for an update, she said. It is more frustrating than anything as all day we have been in limbo not knowingwe would be leaving or not. Another man travelling from the UK said the ban on flights came as a bit of a shock. Will Malpass, , who lives in Clapham, south London, said that he and his partner have been left in a frustrating situation after arriving in Morocco on Sunday. He said that they will now have to travel through France to get home. As it stands, weaposre going through France and thenEurostar back, he said. Mr Malpass said he is not scheduled to fly home until Monday but was notied that his flight had been cancelled when the ban was announced.  It did come as a surprise - it doesnapost feel likeactually solves anything because weaposre just finding a way through another country to get back, Mr Malpass said. Moroccoaposs National Office of Airports said the policy will remain in place until further notice.Latest figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control show that Moroccoaposs weekly rate of reported coronavirus cases on October  stood at . per , people. The rate in the UK is . per , people.The country also banned flights to and from Germany and the Netherlands.  Health leaders in the UK have warned Covid restrictions must immediately be reintroduced.

Our focus remains on ensuring we get boosters out to those who are eligible, a No  spokesman said. But Matthew Taylor, head of the NHS Confederation urged the government to roll out Plan B to avoid hospitals becoming overwhelmed. The health service is right at the edge, he warned.

In a bid to get more freedom and adventure, husband and we Ben, , and Kerry Leppier, also , decided it was time to quit the rat race of day-to-day le and get out. In May, the couple, originally from Bristol, sold their house in the Forest of Dean to move into a mxm caravan with their daughters Florence, , Eden, , and Willow, . The idea behind selling their three bed semi-detached home with a huge garden was to unschool their children. “Unschooling” is the anti-thesis of schooling, with child-led learning that eschews a curriculum in favour of letting children do what they want.  Kerry said that since the move the entire family has been so much happier and that lockdown, and the strict rules needed to protect lives during it, had been a catalyst for the move. She said: After lockdown had ended earlier this year we were really on the hunt for more adventure and freedom after having so many rules to stick to. So we thought what better way to do that than to sell the house, buy a caravan for us to live in, and travel around the UK.  And thataposs exactly what we did. I educate the girls at home anyway using the method of unschooling which we continued while we were on the road and Ben is a self-employed online relationship coach and I help him run the business. So it worked out great for us, we can work and unschool the kids from wherever we are. Unschooling is dferent from home schooling because it is more child led learning, following their interests rather than following a curriculum and replicating a classroom. We have been doing this since the start of this year and the children are very happy. It means they have zero stress in their le and we can watch them thrive in things they are just naturally good at. After moving into the caravan the family made the long journey from Scotland down to Cornwall, where they currently live in Barnstable. The couple said they felt drawn to Devon. Kerry thinks that moving into the caravan has brought them closer together as a family and led to less bickering because they have less things to argue about. She added: The best things about living in the caravan is the sense of adventure and that we have more freedom. We are always outdoors and sitting around fires. Itaposs very cosy and we feel more connected as a family. However itaposs not always plain sailing, a family of five living in a caravan can be challenging. Especially for Ben and I, as it is hard to find time as a couple. At one end of the caravan is the kids end where there is a single bed and bunk beds which folds in to a sofa and dining table. We have a tiny cubicle bathroom with a shower and toilet. However we tend to use the showers on the camp sites. Then you walk through to our small kitchen area and then on to the living room which folds out into mine and Benaposs double bed. It might not be for everyone but it is perfect for us. The girls love it even more than we could have ever expected and so do we.

That first swim was really memorable, I came out of the water feeling revived and invigorated, and I knew I was a convert.’ Jenny persuaded three friends to form a wild swim gang with her and since August they have met weekly for a dip. ‘I don’t wear a wetsuit, it’s too much faff getting in and out of one, just a swimsuit and now I look forward to my swim all week. ‘Front crawling through open water, surrounded by the sounds and sights nature, it’s so amazing and it washes away the stresses of the week.

The stunning snaps show William looking lovingly into his weaposs eyes as they walk through the curtains at the awards. Another photo shows Kate with her arm around her husband as they chat. The Duchess presented the award at the glitzy ceremony, which took place at Alexandra Palace in London, while Wills gave a passionate speech about climate change and the environment. The Dukeaposs ambitious programme aims to find new technologies around the world to tackle climate change, at what experts say is a crucial time in the future of the planet. It has also emerged that Kate is being prepped and moulded to become the queen, royal insiders say. Kate will have an important role in the future of the monarchy and her ability to connect with the public has been noted. Since she has produced three future heirs to the throne the Duchess has already fulfilled her most important role, in royal eyes, since she married second in line Prince William. Royal expert Katie Nicholl has emphasised the important role Kate will have going forward. During the ITV documentary, Kate: The Making of a Modern Queen, Ms Nicholl said Kate was taking steps to become Queen. Ms Nicholl added the palace machine was aware of Kateaposs ability to move the monarchy forward with Prince William as Queen consort. She said: There are two roles to a future Queen. One is to produce heirs, which she has done and one is to learn to one day become Queen. That is very much what we are seeing, we are seeing a Queen in waiting.

Iestyn Brown-Morris, , had been driving home from a trip to Llangynidr mountain around pm when he hit something on the road which caused him to lose control of the vehicle.He heard a loud bang on the left side of the car and then found himself hurtling through the air, Wales Online reports.Iestyn said: I was really scared. I could not think of anything at the time. As I flew off the clf and saw the ground coming closer I really thought I was going to die. “I crashed into the bank and flipped a few times. That car that I worked so hard for for an entire year is a write-off.” Luckily a group of boys and girls spotted Iestyn, and were able to help him get medical attention. He said: They dragged me up the mountain and then shortly after I was stretchered up into the back of an ambulance by the fire brigade. “The emergency services said they can’t believe I survived.

The trial, which was organised by Pfizer and has not been peer-reviewed, tested , participants aged  and older. The results add to mounting data that boosters could help in providing long-lasting protection against the disease, according to analyst Michael Yee.There were no reported cases of severe disease, Mr Yee added. Pfizer had said its two-shot vaccineaposs efficacy drops over time, citing a study that showed % effectiveness from a peak of % four months after a second dose. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter.  Some countries, including the UK, have already gone ahead with plans to administer booster doses. During the study, the median time between the second dose and the booster shot or the placebo was around  months. There were only five cases of Covid- in the booster group, compared with  cases in the group which received the placebo shot. The median age of the participants was  years, with .% of participants between  and  years, and .% at  years or older. The companies said they would submit detailed results of the trial for peer-reviewed publication to the US FDA, the European Medicines Agency and other regulatory agencies, as soon as possible.  US and EU regulators have already authorised a third dose of Covid- vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Inc for patients with compromised immune systems who are likely to have weaker protection from the two-dose regimens. Professor Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, said there is a need to speed up boosters and the vaccination of teenagers. Just . million of the . million at-risk people in the UK who had their second jab at least six months ago have had their third dose, and the gap is growing. The UK has some of the highest Covid rates in Western Europe and Prof Ferguson put this down to waning immunity and fewer control measures here. Prof Fergusonaposs intervention comes as we now have rates of Covid- as high as the January peak when the NHS was almost overwhelmed. The scientist said: “I don’t think we’re looking at another lockdown... the worst case here are demands on the NHS... it’s very unlikely we’ll see anything like the levels of deaths we saw last year, for instance. “Coming into the winter, there may be a Plan B which needs to be implemented, which involves some rolling back of measures, but I doubt that we’ll ever get close to lockdown we were in January of this year.” Comment MORE ON CoronavirusCoronavirus vaccine\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Aidan Sayersapos transformation from an unemployed teenager excluded from school to someone who has a home, car and a job was recognised with an award from the trust presented by Charles. The award winner became emotional as he thanked Claire McGarvey for guiding him through a trust course, telling her: Iaposve got as much love for you as my grandma. Charles appeared tearful as the -year-old spoke during the awards ceremony staged at St Jamesaposs Palace and he later praised the determination of the young people recognised. During a speech, he said: It really is marvellous to be together again in person after this delay of  months or so, this dreadful pandemic, then to share in the celebrations of all these wonderful young people. I find their stories have alternatively moved me, made me laugh and cry. So, Iaposve come to know how proud I am of all of them, and what they represent in terms of the incredible amount of effort and determination they put in to all of this and to win their awards. The awards were presented virtually earlier in the year and the event gave Charles the opportunity to recognise the winners in person. Among the guests were ambassadors and supporters of the Princeaposs Trust and its international body including actors Richard E Grant and Colin Salmon, Edward Enninful, editor-in-chief of British Vogue, comic Hugh Dennis, presenter Kate Garraway and host Fearne Cotton.  Mr Sayers, from Darlington, described school as not for me and later revealed his hopes of joining the Army were dashed because of an allergy, but he enrolled on a Princeaposs Trust Achieve course which gave him purpose and confidence. While on stage, Aidan, who won the Educational Achiever Award, said: Without people like Claire around us I donapost know where Iaposd be, I wouldnapost have a house, I wouldnapost have anywhere to go, I wouldnapost have job, I wouldnapost have anything. Without the Princeaposs Trust I wouldnapost be standing here obviously, I would probably be on the streets. Because of what the Princeaposs Trust has done, what all you lovely people have done.  Iaposm stood here today and I canapost say thank you enough. Among the winners was Cordell Jeffers, awarded the Young Change Maker Award, after supporting thousands of black and ethnic minority students through resilience training, motivational talks and entrepreneur workshops. Mr Jeffers was sent to the Caribbean to finish his education after being excluded from school but began on his current path after completing the trustaposs enterprise programme. Actor Colin Salmon, who appeared in three James Bond movies, joked with Charles before the event began about how he did not need fight training, he just worked out how to hold a pen. The celebrity was impressed by Mr Jeffers, who opened the awards ceremony by telling his story, saying: What Cordell did up there was almost like a warm-up and almost like a performance. And heaposs entered that poetic phase in his le when he understands the depth of what heaposs doing - and thataposs the game.

He couldn’t stand all the brouhaha that went with updates about his health and rightly found it “bloody intrusive”. Eventually, he felt he has done his bit as the Queen’s consort and duly retired. As monarch and head of state, Queen Elizabeth II doesn’t really have that option. Her schedule has been tailored to take her great age into consideration. But nobody can account for daily changes in an elderly person’s physical health. One day they can feel great, the next dreadful.Since emerging from lockdown and the death of her husband, the Queen has thrown herself into work and had a busy schedule.This month since ing from her annual summer break in Balmoral, she seems to have been a constant presence in our newspapers and online. We should not, therefore, be hugely surprised by the advice from her medical household that she should rest up for a few days.Nor that she spent last night in hospital while apospreliminary checksapos took place – her doctors have not gone into detail. Buckingham Palace was forced to make a public statement when a planned two-day trip – to mark the centenary of partition in Northern Ireland – was cancelled.The previous night the Queen attended a reception at Windsor Castle and looked sprightly and certainly not sickly. Buckingham Palace also released video of her virtual audience with the new Governor-General of New Zealand. But her hospitalisation followed a very busy period – a speech at the opening of the Welsh Parliament and a service at Westminster Abbey marking the work of the Royal British Legion.At the Abbey she was pictured using a cane for the first time. The Palace said she was using it for her “comfort”.This coupled with the fact that she has given up her favourite alcohol tipple – a strong early evening Martini – on doctors’ advice, has got some very commentators worried. But London Bridge is NOT falling down and Her Majesty is in fine fettle, I am told.She is determined to host world leaders at COP in Glasgow at the end of the month.But these wobbles are an important reminder that despite saying “you’re as young as you feel”, Her Majesty is as old as her  years.She is a robust lady, a dedicated lady, and a brilliant wise head of state. She must, therefore, recognise, as her late husband did, that she is only human and she must pace herself going forward - for all our sakes.

Judge Davies said: He is plainly a persistent offender, who leaves misery in his wake.  He is either unable or unwilling to change and ignores the criminal law. An order excluding him from Westminster would simply be ignored. If he does not obey the law he will not obey a Criminal Behaviour Order and simply offend in other London boroughs and transfer his misery to Camden or Wandsworth. I doubt Mr Lascelles gives consideration to his behaviour.” The court had been told by Westminster’s rough-sleeping co-ordinator George Bossman that he had tried since August  to find Lascelles housing, but “he has always ended up losing his accommodation due to his inappropriate behaviour and has now exhausted all of his options. Support has not worked and placement in hotels has not worked. It costs a lot of money to place him in a hotel, but there was constant anti-social behaviour and criminal damage.  I have engaged with his father, who has now accommodated him in a hotel in Victoria. He recently lost his accommodation at the King Georgeaposs Hostel in Great Peter Street, Victoria - named after his great-great grandfather King George V. The court heard Lascelles is addicted to the powerful synthetic marijuana aposSpiceapos and mixes with the users and dealers who congregate in Westminster, particularly around The Strand. When Lascelles isn’t terrorising Westminster, he sometimes spends time on his parent’s farm in France and “when he works there it calms him down.”  Lascelles has multiple convictions for racially-aggravated criminal offences and was once banned from Sainsburyaposs in The Strand for telling staff: Go back to where you come from. Iaposm going to kick you out of the country. Youaposre not English. Westminsteraposs anti-social behaviour officer Anna Hows told the court: Westminster is the hub of rough sleeping and Spice use and it is in his best interests to be removed from the borough and for the respite of the community. The politan Police also threw their weight behind the application to ban Lascelles and PC Zak Ali told the court: It is quite a y history when it comes to his offending pattern. We are seeking an order on behalf of the businesses and residents of Westminster to offer respite from this inidual, who has convictions for anti-social acts and criminal damage. The officer said on August  police were called to a fight outside Italian restaurant Prezzo in the West End involving Lascelles.  The officer said: That is just one. There are others and he would commit a number of offences on the same day and be arrested numerous times in one week. He is a burden on the politan Police and many violent incidents are not reported to the police, particularly from outreach services and the council. He is a Spice addict and Westminster is the epicentre of Spice dealing. This order would prevent him legally from doing that. Lascelles was also due to be sentenced for an offence of criminal damage after pleading guilty to vandalising a door on April  at Look Ahead Housing  Care in Vauxhall Bridge Road, Victoria and this will be dealt with when he is arrested.

Gordon Bircham and Caitlin OaposBrien, who were looking after the nine-year-old boy, allowed the property to become so filthy it was infested with flies and insects. His bedroom walls and mattress were covered in animal urine and excretement, while the wider flat was filled with so much rubbish and filth that the boy’s bedroom and the bathroom were obstructed. Investigating officers found that rotting rubbish, stale food, dirty clothes and other waste was strewn all throughout the house. The details emerged yesterday when Bircham, , and OaposBrien, , appeared in the dock at Kilmarnock Sherf Court for sentencing. According to Daily Record reports, the pair had previously pleaded guilty to a charge of wilfully neglecting the child, who is now , at a property in the Ayrshire town in July .Speaking in court, prosecutor Angie Bennett said the child had told officers that he didn’t knowhe had any clean clothes. He had pointed out his bedroom to police, she said, though officers were unable to enter the bedroom due to the amount of household rubbish and empty food boxes on the floor. Other rooms in the house were in a not dissimilar condition,” she continued. There was a cat litter tray which was full and had spilled over and had then flooded into the bathroom. There was human and animal faeces on the floor of the toilet and the walls.  It seemed to the police there was nowhere for the child to wash or brush his teeth. There appeared to be no clean clothes and there did not appear to be any food for him. The court heard of how the boy was taken away to a place of safety. Bircham and OaposBrien could not be cautioned and charged over the neglect because they were so upset. The charge they pleaded guilty to, under Section  of the Children and Young PersonsAct , also stated there was only mouldy and out of date food within the kitchen and that they did thus expose said child to the risk of injury, infection and illness. Defence solicitor Gillian Swanney said Bircham had experienced a signicant deterioration in his mental health and that of his ex-partner around March last year and spiralled out of control. She said he was now receiving anti-depression medication, had got himself a job and was seeking help for his alcoholism. After hearing they were no longer a couple, Sherf Colin Bissett spared them both jail. He said: Your behaviour towards this boy was disgusting and extremely regretful. I am prepared to deal with the matter by way of an alternative to custody. Itaposs a punishment that requires you to pay back to the community for your crime. He placed them both on a Community Payback Order which will see them supervised by social workers for  months. They also have  months to do  hours of unpaid work, reduced from  as they admitted their guilt.

Susan Abbottaposs victims - who cannot be named for legal reasons - were so embarrassed and ashamed it took them years to finally go to the police. The -year-old was unanimously convicted of three sexual assault charges and two of assault in court on Thursday.She denied any wrongdoing, forcing her victims - who were as young as five and six when the abuse began - to give evidence against her, reports the Daily Record. The girl said she initially thought it was normal but now suffers from flashbacks and nightmares. Abbott has a previous conviction for child neglect.  She has now been placed on the Sex Offendersapos Register and is awaiting sentencing. The children told how they would wake up to find Abbott, of Dalmellington, East Ayrshire, in bed beside them. The abuse began when defendant was  and took place at properties in Ardrossan, North Ayrshire, before coming to an end in . She made the boy watch porn and tried to force him to have sex with her when the boy was aged just five. Kilmarnock Sherf Court heard it was not possible because the boy was so young he was physically unable. She then forced him to take part in sexual activity. The abuse stopped when he turned seven.  Abbott began abusing the girl when she was six. The girl told the court she would wake up to find Abbott lying on top of her. The abuse lasted until she was  or . She also beat the children, repeatedly punching and slapping them on the head and body. Giving evidence, the girl said: I wasnapost too sure about the sexual abuse and then when I realised what was actually happening I didnapost know how to tell anyone. As it started at such a young age I didnapost really understand what it was. I thought it was normal at that point in time, but the older I got I started to realised it wasn’t normal. I felt ashamed. Prosecutor Craig Wainwright said: She abused her position of trust over the children for her own sexual gratication. She also assaulted both children on a number of occasions. All the occasions [of sexual abuse] were at night, at a time when she was drinking. The court heard it took the children so long to go to police due to shame and embarrassment at what had happened to them. Mr Wainwright added: He found it hard to come to terms with being a male who was sexually abused by a female. After the verdict, Sherf David Hall said it was an anxious case and continued Abbottaposs bail ahead of sentencing.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON CrimeCourt case\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In the footage the undergraduate student can be seen struggling to get up a flight of stairs while her eyes rolled and her head slumped on to the bannister. She says that she was spiked and has called on clubs to do more to protect revellers, including using lids on drinks, like with takeaway coffees, to protect clubbers. In an interview with the BBC, with whom she shared the footage, she said: I basically got spiked at a nightclub in Bristol and I only knew it happened when I saw the videos of it.And looking back on it I could have predicted it happening.

Anna Stephen had had four drinks before reaching a club in Edinburgh with a group of boys from the year above, who were known as the freshersapos dads as part of the uniaposs buddy system. Having been drinking for several years, the now -year-old knew her limits and was fully in control all night until she got out of the taxi by the venue. Thinking sheaposd had too much to drink, the bouncer blocked Anna from going inside and told her to go and drink some water. After staggering to Tesco to get some water and slumping on the floor, the student managed to stagger home to her friendaposs house. There she lay on the floor for hours, unable to talk and vomiting relentlessly.  While Anna was physically unharmed by whoever drugged her, the experience has shaken her deeply. Sheaposs unsure who specically spiked her, leading her to completely remove herself from the friendship group. The worst things about this whole experience was that I was unable to speak for most of it and didn’t feel in control of my body at all, but I remember everything so clearly, she told The Mirror. I’ve been spiked since, a couple of years ago in Ibiza, and the experience was the same. It makes me sick because it’s so frightening and would be sosomeone was attacked in this state too. Youaposd be unable to do anything to try and stop it. Anna is one of the many people who are bravely coming forward to share their experience of being spiked, following alarming reports that nightle predators are using needles to inject drugs into victims. Tammy Kendall is another woman whose been targeted in Edinburgh clubs - not just once, but three times, in three dferent venues.  On one occasion she was out with her dad when she suddenly started feeling really unwell. The -year-old blacked out and has no memory of the night. When she awoke the next day, friends told her sheaposd been so sick and delirious, she kept saying she wanted to kill herself. On another occasion she was kicked out of a club by a bouncer who thought she was too drunk, leaving Tammy to pass out on the street outside.  During the third she was relentlessly sick. It was the worst things I have ever experienced, she recalled. I couldn’t remember where I was, the date or who I was with. I couldn’t remember how I got home, I was being violently sick and I was spewing blood.Tammy and Anna are just two of dozens of people who have shared their experiences of being spiked in Edinburgh on a single Instagram post.The alarmingof the thread, and the distressing details of many of the comments, hints at how large a problem spiking is in the UK.  Figures obtained by the BBC show that there were , reported incidents in England and Wales since . Many incidents of drink spiking go unreported because people are unaware they’ve fallen victim to it, meaning the true number is likely much higher. What to do about such a common place yet upsetting issue is dficult. In the past week calls to increase security at bars and clubs have gained traction, yet some argue searches are easy to evade and may further discriminate against the already marginalised. Calls for women to take additional preventative measures have been knocked back by those who argue it should not be the victimaposs responsibility to foil perpetrators. Anna believes that the onus to protect victims lies in numerous places. I know it’s a big ask, but the clubs and pubs also have a responsibility towards the public as per licensing to make sure they are safe, she said. I also think we as the public can do more to help. Like the amount of people who just walk past people who’re struggling or those who are too embarrassed to askthey need help. We need to start being more forward thinking as a society and not be scared to ask someonethey are okay.

Groups from more than  universities including Edinburgh, Bristol, and Leeds are hoping that staying away from bars and clubs will highlight how more needs to be done to stop the illegal drugging. Over the past week many people have come forward to share their stories of being spiked.Yesterday Edinburgh student Anna Stephen told the Mirror how she was left unable to speak after a night-out with older students who sheaposd been buddied up with. Campaigner Mair Howells recalled how she was found in a menaposs toilet cubicle after blacking out at a club.Claudia Laing, , collapsed and was unable to move inside aposaposs in Manchester after downing a Jagerbomb last week and began foaming at the mouth.The hundreds of upsetting stories that those targeted have bravely shared have helped contribute to a sense that something needs to change. The boycott has been spearheaded by Martha Williams, a third-year university student from Edinburgh who created the Girls Night In Edinburgh Instagram account.People have shared their stories of being spiked on the page, which has given energy to a nationwide campaign pushing for nightle reforms. Martha has written an open letter to all nightclubs in Edinburgh with suggestions people have been sending her, including more thorough entry checks, having high definition CCTV, see-through cups, and training staff in drug misuse. Larissa Kennedy, the president of the National Union of Students, has said it’s “disgusting” that so many women are getting spiked. “My rage, love and solidarity goes out to all those who have been impacted by these violent acts, and all other women and marginalised folks who experience sexual violence on our campuses and in our communities, she told the Huff Post. Students in Manchester are planning to boycott clubs on October  in a bid to force venues to increase safety measures.  It comes as police investigate reports that three women fell ill at Ark nightclub in the city last month.Students told the Manchester Evening News they donapost feel safe in nightclubs at the moment.Morgan Hall, , who studies at Manchester politan University, doesn’t feel safe in clubs at the moment. She said: “It doesn’t feel safeyou’re in a club and a girl.  “I know someone who was spiked by a bartender, but it isn’t just women being spiked. The Liberation and Access Officer at the University of Manchester’s Students’ Union added: “People need to feel safe going out and people doing the spikings need to know they can’t, that venues won’t accept it. “The number of emails we’ve had from students saying ‘we don’t feel safe’ and don’t feel safe to go out.  “I’ve heard people saying they’ll treat the boycott as a lads night out. But men get spiked too.” Spiking has long been a problem in the UK, but has been thrust into the spotlight over the past week due to reports of an alarming form of the crime. Numerous woman have been injected with drugs while out in several UK cities. While there may be a recent upwards trend in cases of the form of illegal drugging, it is not a new phenomenon. Analysis of records by The Mirror found that people have been spiked via injection at least for the past two decades.In the earliest case, a woman reported being injected by a stranger during a night out at a club in  in St Helens, Merseyside. She suffered dizziness, high temperature and a raging thirst and was given precautionary hepatitis treatment.

The most up to date map from October  shows a scene of rising cases across all four countries. Some areas, particularly Bath and Somerset, and Swindon in England, and the Vale of Glamorgan, Neath Port Talbot, and Caerphilly in South Wales all are recording + cases per , people, the highest in the UK. The map paints a worrying picture as winter sets in, with the majority of areas recording rates over  cases per , people over a seven day period.  When compared to a map almost three months prior the dference is clear as data from July , shortly after Freedom Day on July , shows how cases have rocketed. At the time, during the summer, only a few areas recorded  or more cases per , people, the rate that has now become the average across the UK. The Vale of Glamorgan even went from having one of the lowest instances of Covid in the summer, to the highest in mid-October. It recorded - cases per , people in the summer, and now has over  cases per , people.  With the complete unlocking, lax mask wearing and a sluggish rollout of booster jabs, cases have rocketed from the halcyon days of summer. Scotland still has the lowest rates compared to the rest of the UK, and Northern Ireland’s rates were higher in the summer and continue to be as high as the rest of the UK, but the country did open up at a slightly later date. Presently, the South-East is faring better than most of the UK, but as cases continue to rise and winter sets in, forcing more people indoors into poorly ventilated spaces, numbers are expected to continue to go up.  This comes as recently health secretary Sajid Javid refused to adopt a ‘Plan B’ ahead of winter, despite calls from the NHS Confederation.Speaking in a press conference earlier this week, Mr Javid said whilst the NHS was under pressure, it was not “unsustainable” pressure, suggesting that this, and not death rate, continues to be the metric that will determineextra measures come in. Mr Javid called on Brits to show their “Blitz spirit” and get their booster Covid jab and said: On this particular question we don’t believe the pressures currently faced by the NHS are unsustainable.  Donapost get me wrong, there are huge pressures, especially in AE, in primary care for example as well. But at this point we donapost believe they are unsustainable. The Health Secretary did call upon people to continue to wear face masks in enclosed spaces but refused to make doing so compulsory. Mr Javid warned that restrictions would “of course” Brits did not wear masks or get their booster jabs when able to. Analysis by the Mirror shows that, as cases rise week-on-week in all regions, there are particular hotspots in Birmingham, Manchester and Nottingham.Comment MORE ON Plan BNHSCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But the latest Netweather charts show a huge Atlantic weather front quickly travelling eastwards towards the UK over the weekend.  This could smash into the UK as soon as Monday afternoon, signicantly increasing the chance of prolonged periods of torrential rain. Met Office meteorologist Alex Deakin said the pattern of the Atlantic jet stream appears to be north-south, which is very evident indeed. He warned low pressure areas will be driven in by the jet stream towards northern areas of the UK, which will trigger periods of rain throughout the country. But he warned that with this amplying jet stream, that could mean things get stuck, which could bring with it persistent rain for a number of days. Mr Deakin said: On Monday, there is low pressure nearby and a weather front sitting across the UK. But the jet stream isnapost really engaging with the low pressure and is staying to the south.  The pattern of the jet stream is more north-south, particularly in the Atlantic, which is very evident indeed. The key point for next week is the weather will be coming in from the west and the Atlantic. He added: From Tuesday onwards, low pressure areas being driven in by the jet stream with the highest pressure down to the south. These low pressure systems moving in will bring spells of rain across the country. With that amplying jet stream, that could mean things get stuck. There is the possibility of one weather system just lying across the north of the UK and getting stuck, which could bring persistent rain for a number of days.  However, on a shorter timeframe, this weekend it will be unsettled with rain and some dry and bright spells on Sunday. A spokesperson from the Met Office said: A weather front moves across the UK on Saturday bringing rain to the west, but by the time it reaches Kent it will have fragmented bringing the chance of showers to the South East but many places could stay dry altogether. It will stay largely dry and bright on Sunday, before a band of showery rain moves eastwards overnight. Further scattered showers Monday, perhaps heavy along south coast. Largely dry and bright on Tuesday. With warm air coming in from the south it will be a mild weekend with temperatures in the mid-teens for Kent feeling very pleasant particularly in any sunshine. For the UK, the rest of October is forecast to be dominated by more unsettled weather coming in from the Atlantic, with the north and west of the country taking the biggest hit.

At night, expect frost in the northeast and a few fog patches in the southeast. Things are expected to take a turn for the worse from Tuesday, with the Met Office warning of heavy rain and strong, locally gale force winds. It said in its forecast for October  to November : Some rainbands could become slow-moving with locally large rainfall accumulations possible, particularly over western hills. The rest of October will continue to see unsettled and windy weather arriving from the Atlantic, with outbreaks of potentially heavy rain for many. Wettest in the west and northwest, but still with brief dry interludes. Driest conditions likely across some south and southeastern areas.Tyler Roys, senior meteorologist and lead European forecaster from Accuweather, told the Express: In regards to wind and rain, the potential for aposwind stormsapos and heavy rain events is there with a moderate confidence level.At this time it is hard to pinpoint when these events will occur through early November. Mr Roys warned that a cold weather front could approach the UK towards the end of the month and bring snow to the Scottish Highlands. He added: As we move into November we are watching for a potential cold shot to work its way into Europe. Met Office five-day weather forecast Friday Breezy with a mix of cloud and sunny intervals, with the best of the sunshine in the far south and also central and northern Scotland. There will also be showers, most of which will be in central and northwestern areas. Friday night A few light showers in west,  clear spells allowing a frost in the northeast and a few fog patches in the southeast. Cloud and rain into far northwest later. Saturday Strengthening winds, cloud and outbreaks of rain spreading to the north and west, whilst other areas have a good deal of cloud, isolated light showers and a few sunny intervals.Sunday to TuesdayShowery rain Sunday, then sunshine and showers Monday, locally heavy, perhaps thundery. Rain moving from the west on Tuesday. Windy at times. Temperatures near normal, becoming milder by Tuesday.

Stumbling, tongue-tied Maggie Throupcould barely read out her prepared statement. Embarrassing. It doesn’t matter, because it said nothing new. The Government is paralysed in the face of mounting Covid dangers. Ms Throup droned out the official line: Stick to Plan A. No Plan B, no ­mandatory face coverings on public transport or in schools, no vaccine ­passports for crowded events, noto social distancing, no push for homeworking. Nothing, except for some gratuitous advice to behave sensibly and wait until the end of the year for a “miracle pill” that could halve Covid deaths. But the crisis is now. The Government admits infection rates are soaring towards , a day. A new, more contagious iant of Delta is circulating, hospital admissions are rising and the death toll has surged to , a week. The booster campaign is sluggish, and vaccination of  to -year-olds patchy at best. In my village of Sutton and Crosshills the infection rate has doubled to . per ,. Covid is raging through North Yorkshire schools, and our academy has , pupils. I no longer shop at my Co-op during school breaks, because they congregate in groups without masks. Admissions to our local hospital are up %, and one patient has died. The outlook is bad, but Boris Johnson, in hock to his hardline Covid Recovery Group of free-market backbench MPs, resolutely buries his head in the sand. It is not a pretty sight, especially when he talks through his backside. He claims Covid is “under control”. Hardly. He should “take back control”. He’s completely out of touch with public opinion.

In September, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationrecommended that everyone over  be offered a third dose of a Covid vaccine, as well as medical staff and younger adults with medical conditions.Only those who had had their second jab six months or more ago would be invited for a booster. Estimates reported where suggest that  million people would be ready for a third vaccine by mid-December. But at the current rate of roll-out, all the most at risk will not be jabbed again until the end of January. The push to encourage vaccine take-up comes as the daily number of cases reported in the UK surpassed , for the first time since mid-July. However, millions remain unsure of their eligibility for the jab and how to go about getting it. Here are some questions about boosters answered. Why is a booster needed  A booster jab will top up the immunity of those already fully inoculated against the virus. The NHS said a booster jab will help improve the protection you have from your first two doses of the vaccine, helping to give you longer-term protection against getting seriously ill from Covid-.  Does a booster make a big dference  A booster shot of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech has a dramatic effect, the firms claimed after a trial. A booster dose given to patients who had the initial two jabs showed a relative vaccine efficacy of .% when compared with those who did not receive a booster. Pfizer said that during the study period, there were five cases of Covid- in the booster group, and  cases in the non-boosted group.  Who is eligible  Those eligible for boosters include anyone aged  and over, people living and working in care homes for the elderly, and frontline health and social care workers. All those who are clinically extremely vulnerable and anyone aged  to  in an at-risk group for Covidwill also be eligible for a jab. Adults who share a household with vulnerable people will also be offered the booster. At what point do people receive a booster Booster doses can only be offered to people who are at least six months on from receiving their second dose of coronavirus vaccine. But there is talk of that changing  Yes. The interval between a second dose of Covid- vaccine and a booster could be cut from six months to five under plans reportedly being discussed by ministers and experts. The Government said the time interval between doses was a matter for the experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation . What jab will be given as a booster  The JCVI expressed a preference for people to get the Pfizer jab as a third dose, regardless of which jab they were initially given. But it said that half doses of the Moderna jab could be used as an alternative. Some people may be offered a booster dose of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccinethey cannot have the Pfizer BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, the NHS said. How do I book a booster appointment  The NHS says most people will be invited to book an appointment at a larger vaccination centre, pharmacy, or local NHS service such as a GP surgery. People who have not received an invitation within one week of the six month milestone can book an appointment online without an invitation.  Can I get the flu jab at the same time as the booster  Yes. The NHS says that most people who can get a Covid- booster vaccine are also eligible for the annual flu vaccine and it is safe to have them at the same time. The UKaposs flu season usually begins in September and ends in March but the NHS usually starts to feel the pressure in January. However Dr McCauley - a prominent flu scientist based at Londonaposs Francis Crick Institute - says Brits should prepare for an earlier surge in cases due to a rise in infections overseas.

The blood flow to Amy Wisemanaposs face was blocked last month after the procedure went badly wrong.The -year-old from Durham paid £ for the injection and was told there was nothing to worry about. But she knew something wasnapost right when she was left in agony with a bruised lip and now wants people need to be made aware of how dangerous lip filler can be. After sharing photos her dramatically-swollen lip, a quick-thinking dental colleague had them checked by plastic surgeons and a GP, who warned her that the filler could have blocked the blood supply in her face. Horried Amy was told by medics that she could have lost her eyesight and movement in the left side of her faceher lip filler wasnapost dissolved within  hours. The dental nurse claims that the filler was injected into an artery, causing a vascular occlusion, where blood canapost pass through a blood vessel. Amy claims her lip had been starved of oxygen and she had  hours to save her face before the tissue completely died, which would have left her needing a skin graft to save her dying face.  The filler was dissolved by a medical practitioner the next day who told her that sheaposd been at risk of losing her eyesight - while a GP said she was lucky to still have a lip at all. Amy said: I was in utter shock when they said I could lose my sight. I didnapost know what was going on. I didnapost knowmy lips could be saved orthey would be permanently damaged. I had reduced blood flow because the filler was blocking the artery so the bruising was blood that had nowhere to go. The dentist saidI didnapost get it dissolved in  hours then I would go blind.  If I didnapost work in a dentist, I would have lost my eyesight and the left side of my face and I would have needed a tissue graft in my face. WhatIaposd ended up losing my eyesight and face  I wouldnapost want to be here. Amy had .ml injected but immediately noticed something wasnapost right as sheaposs been having the treatment since she was . After frantically messaging the beautician whoaposd carried out the treatment, she was assured that the bruising was normal and Amy thanks her career as a dental nurse for saving her sight. Amy said: After the first injection, I felt severe pain but I didnapost think anything of it because I know getting your lips done hurts but it was worse than Iaposve experienced before. I told the lady and she said it will look swollen because sheaposd hit a vein but itaposs nothing to worry about unless its a vascular occlusion. I asked how she knew it wasnapost that and she said it was fine.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

They were bruised straight away which they donapost normally do and the left side of my lip didnapost look right at all and the pain was awful. It was agony. I sent a photo to the lady, she said it was just bruising and I trusted her because sheaposs done them before. Later on the pain got really bad and I was really worried so I sent a photo to a dentist at work and they said I needed to go to the hospital. I went but there was a six-hour wait so I thought Iaposd leave it until the morning. My colleague sent photos to GPs and plastic surgeons she knows who said I needed to get it dissolved as soon as possible. The dentist dissolved the filler and the GP theyaposd been in touch with said the fact I still had my lip was unbelievable. If it wasnapost for me working in a dentist, I would have taken the ladyaposs advice. They used six cartridges over two days to dissolve .ml of filler. Amy says she the traumatic ordeal has knocked her confidence so much that itaposs put her off lip filler treatment for le. She is sharing her ordeal in a bid to raise awareness and urge people to only get lip filler treatment by medically trained professionals. Amy said: It has put me off and I wouldnapost get them done again butI was to get them done again Iaposd go to someone who is medically trained. People do a lip filler course in a day and theyaposre qualied. A medic could have diagnosed the issue and resolved it straight away. People need to be made aware of how dangerous it can be.

She lost weight after joining Slimming WorldMolly Gallagher dropped from st to st Image: Molly Gallagher FacebookByNathan Bevan:,  Oct | commentsA woman who was left unable to put her socks on ended up shedding almost half her body weight. Molly Gallagher, , dropped from st to st after one morning she realised she could not bend forward enough to slip the garments over her feet. The mum-of-two from Maesteg, Wales, said being overweight had always been an issue during her le.She told Wales Online : I was finally spurred into losing weight after getting ready for work one morning and realising I wasnapost able to put my own socks on.I was sitting on the edge of the bed getting dressed and couldnapost bend forward enough because my stomach was in the way.  I had to wriggle around on my back until Iaposd succeeded getting them on - it was exhausting. And by the time I eventually arrived at the office I went straight into the toilets and burst into tears. She added: I was always the biggest among my group of friends. Theyaposd all be either size eight or  and Iaposd be a size . It made me so self-conscious Iaposd dread going out - or,I did, Iaposd over compensate with lots of dark make-up and outlandish clothes. I was a bit of a goth back in the day and that image became like a shield for the real me to hide behind.  Deep down though I was a walking contradiction and couldnapost go into a pub without worrying that people might stare at me. Molly said that her mum and sister also struggled with being overweight during their lives and became diabetic - meaning she was also worried she would get ill. She blamed being overweight on her eating habits as after work she and her partner John often ordered takeaway food. But after her neighbour joined Slimming World, Molly felt encouraged to do the same. She said she managed to lose six stone in the run-up to the first Covid lockdown, doing sport and eating well.  However, when she started working from home and exercising less due to gyms being closed, there was a slight relapse. She then found the strength to get back on track and is now happy with her weight loss. Molly said: I just knew I had to stick to the plan - I needed to change and thataposs what Slimming World is. Itaposs not a diet, itaposs a lestyle sht. Itaposs about setting your own targets and making better choices. Nothingaposs off limits provided you stay within your daily allowances.

An employment tribunal heard on one occasion he held her arms in a tight grip and refused to release them while saying aposI will close up early and you can take your clothes off and do a strip show for meapos. Miss Ali, a Wahabi Muslim, was also told at work that her branch of Islam was aposthe cause for the terrorism that is happening in the worldapos. Now she has won her case after the tribunal ruled she was a victim of sexual and religious harassment four years ago.  The hearing - held remotely - was told Miss Ali started working at Pepeaposs Piri Piri as front of house staff in May . In January  Miss Ali had texted Hungarian Mr Szoke to say that she was running a little late and apologised. He said aposo.k.apos and then texted back aposluv yaapos. The tribunal heard Mr Szoke claim this was most likely a mistake in he meant to send this to his we, but this explanation was dismissed because the Hungarian would not usually speak to his we in English. Employment Judge Sarah George ruled this was not discrimination or harassment but added: Our view is that this was an unusually familiar thing to say to a conservative Muslim woman with whom he was not particularly friendly. In June  Mr Szoke was seen grabbing Miss Ali and sexually harassing her.  Miss Ali told the tribunal: I noticed the assistantaposs manager Zoltanaposs behaviour towards me started to [become] inappropriate... every time we would be on sht he would start touching me. The tribunal heard he held her arms in a very inappropriate and uncomfortable way refusing to let go and said I will close up early and you can take your clothes off and do a strip show for me. Judge George ruled this was sexual harassment, adding: She was sufficiently discomfited by what had happened to raise it with her GP.

In July , Mohammed Hussein, father of restaurant owner Ar Hussein, made comments to Miss Ali, a Wahabi Muslim, about Wahabism in which he equated it to extremism and terrorism. The tribunal heard there was a conversation about Nawaz Shar, the then Prime Minister of Pakistan, when Mr Hussein snr interrupted the conversation and said it was due to Saudi Arabia. He said: The Saudi and Wahabiaposs influence brainwashed him. He went on to say that Saudi Arabia is the cause of extremism and terrorism and are responsible for the terror attacks that are going on in the world and walked off. Miss Ali messaged Ar Hussein about this, saying aposyou need to take action of this discrimination thataposs taken place in the workplace... I donapost feel safe when Mohammedaposs there anymore heaposs always giving snarky and rude remarks... I want this matter to be dealt with please I canapost tolerate it anymoreapos. Mr Husseinaposs response was: It seems that you are against people that speak out against terrorism and religious extremism. If you are asking someone to stop speaking out against such matters that is something that I would need to report to the police. Judge George ruled both men were guilty of religious harassment towards Miss Ali. Mr Hussein snr. was equating Wahabis to extremism to terrorism without distinction and without qualication, he said. The tribunal found Miss Ali resigned in August  in response to an error in her wages, but added in her resignation she felt she was a victim of bullying and harassment and referred to a toxic environment where I have been targeted for many months.

Steven Bertolino, the lawyer for Chris and Roberta Laundrie, said the rumours were hogwash and the couple have now lost their lives and are suffering. On Thursday human remains found in Florida were identied as belonging to Brian.The -year-old vanished last month after ing from a road trip without his partner Gabby Petito, , and refused to cooperate with an investigation into her disappearance as he became the sole person of interest.Gabbyaposs body was later discovered in a remote area in Wyoming on September , and a post-mortem confirmed she had been strangled.  The FBI launched a manhunt for Laundrie, and named him as a person of interest in Gabbyaposs death. Human remains were found alongside a backpack and notepad belonging to Laundrie at the Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park on Wednesday. The FBI later said they were able to identy Laundrie through dental records.In an interview with NBC News after the grim discovery Laundrieaposs lawyer Steven Bertolino said Brian was in a distraught state of mind before he left for the last time.He said: I can tell you Brian was very upset when he left. Chris conveyed to me several times he wished he wouldnapost have let him go, but he couldnapost stop him.  Both Chris and Roberta Laundrie were at the scene when the remains and personal items were discovered, he said previously, after they said they wanted to join in the search. He said: Chris didnapost want to pick the bag up because he wanted law enforcement to see it. This was caught on camera. He went on to say that Chris found Brianaposs white plastic dry bag in front of a news reporter, as police uncovered his backpack and human remains. He said: Chris couldnapost find the law enforcement because they were then out of sight, because Chris had been in the woods, so he didnapost want to leave the bag there with the news reporter standing nearby, so he picked it up. The Laundries were then asked to leave the park as investigations continued, he said.  He added: At that point, the Laundries were notied that there was also remains near the backpack and they were asked to leave the reserve. The lawyer had also dismissed suggestions the parents planted Brian’s possessions, saying they were both being shadowed by reporters and police. He called those suggestions “hogwash.” Gabby and Laundrie embarked on their trip in early July from New Yorkaposs Long Island, where her parents live. As they travelled through Kansas, Colorado, Utah and points west, Gabby documented their van le on social media.She posted her final photo to Instagram on August , the same day she last spoke to her mum by phone.The remains of both have now been identied.

The semi-detached property, which isnapost linked to the wizarding stories in any way, is on Station Road in Coleshill, Birmingham, and is on the market for £,. But it seems the agent who listed the three-bedroom home is a huge fan of Harry Potter and wrote an elaborate description of the property drawing comparisons between the house and the series. Picking up attention on Reddit, people have said the listing is absurd. The listing reads: “Welcome to Kings Cross Station,  Nine and three quarters, and all aboard the Hogwarts Express! For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here “Unfortunately, this time, the  isnapost invisible to other muggles, so youaposll have to move quick to get this home as it is sure to be popular. “Sitting within the convenient spot of Coleshill, this superbly appointed home has been renovated throughout and comprises an entrance hall, two reception rooms and a fabulous modern kitchen to the ground floor. “Upstairs, in the Gryffindor house, you have three bedrooms, including two doubles and a small third which would be the perfect nursery or study and an uber stylish family bathroom.  “Outside, be sure to book a window seat as you will want the vistas over the sweeping front garden overlooking a green, and the generous rear garden. “So sneak past any other buyers in your invisibility cloak and call us today to book in your viewing, as it wonapost take a wizard to work out that this is a wonderful home!” Although entertaining, Reddit users couldnapost understand why the agent had chosen a Harry Potter theme to list the house, which doesnapost appear to be magical in any way. One user said: “There is nothing Harry Potter themed about the actual property.” “The only link I can see is that the kitchen is about the same size as Harry’s childhood bedroom,” another person quipped. Someone  commented: “Someone was either very bored at work or is stuck in an estate agent job when they really aspire to be a writer.” Another user questionedthe agent was trying to appeal to a younger audience with the references - but added they were probably alienating older people who might be interested in the property. One person had a rather creative guess as to why the agent had chosen to reference the wizarding world, suggesting: “It could be a way to get off the hook about not having directly mentioned the ghosts and owls.” The property is currently on the market with Andrew Downing Booth estate agents.

At first Braxton didnapost notice Alex in the costume until he made a noise and started shaking a branch. But as soon as he saw him he started running over screaming apositaposs Bigfoot I swearapos. The cousins, who are also neighbours, live on a  acre plot of land with a creek, and when the children called to say they were stuck, they seized the opportunity to carry out the plan.  Veronica said: We had been planning on pranking them with the Bigfoot costume and we were finally able to get them. In these parts and in Louisiana, people say there is a Bigfoot on the loose and go out hunting Bigfoot. Morgan always says as a joke to the boys when they go out to play - aposdonapost let Big Foot get ya!apos The boys were a bit sceptical that he exists so we came up with a plan to prank them about a month ago but we hadnapost got the chance until now.

She paid £. and waited two weeks for her new purchase to arrive at the door. But when the -year-old opened the packaging, she was disappointed to pull out a crumpled bucket hat that she claims left her looking like Shaun Ryder.

Luckily, Lizzy recovered from the experience to find a few straw hats that were perfect to shield her in the summer.

Many years have passed since Jamie Oliver revolutionised school dinners - for better or for worse - but for the most part, parents have had free reign over what they feed their children in their packed lunches. Over the past couple of years, however, schools have begun getting more and more involved in what parents are feeding their youngsters - with one school even going as far as banning unhealthy lunches. As a result, one mum has turned to support from other parents on Facebook, in quest to discover more healthy packed lunch options, after her childaposs school implemented a aposhealthy living policy.apos The mum took to the All Packed Up - Kids Packed Lunch Ideas and Sharing UK - Facebook group, to share the aposnew healthy policy listapos for her sonaposs school.Iaposd like to get some ideas together that I can have on a list for me to look at and out lunches together quickly. Any ideas would be great. Thank you, she wrote.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Meanwhile, pastries and pies, along with any other food or drink items that staff feel is unhealthy were also banned. The post quickly received hundreds of comments from parents who debated whether it should be up to the school to police what goes in packed lunches. I think you should complain and tell them to stop being so ridiculous! I’m all for healthy eating and glad the schools support it to a point…but this is going too far and I’d be getting back to them with my opinion, one parent commented. However, another disagreed: This is exactly how my childrenaposs school food policy is and I must say I prefer it. I make healthy snacks and they are happy to not have any junk at school. A third wrote: Personally think parents should feed what they think it ok for their child to eat and no teacher should dictate that.

Another video shared by the same account, @fakrulazwa, shows rescuers struggling to fit the mammoth creature into the boot of a car. The snake is so big it takes at least three people to lt it.

It is not clear what snake species was shown in the video but the deadly boa constrictor is native to the Caribbean island. It comes after one of the deadliest snakes in the world was discovered in the UK after crawling into a suitcase from India. Luckily the reptile was too chilly from its long journey to launch an attack when it was found in Coryton, Essex. But wildle officials said the viper was very agitated and aggressive.

The second, her last, contained a fatal dose of barbiturates. Stephanie said: “She was laughing and smiling when she took the drink, there was no hesitation. She was happy to go and in control. She wanted to be free and she was just about to be.

She loved laughter – and loved le, but she’d had enough of this one. We both hadtickets to the UK but my mum had no intention of using hers.” But Isabel did ask her daughter to record her final moments andhome to Woking, Surrey, with the tape of her last words to help the fight for a law change. Assisted dying opponents say current rules protect the vulnerable from being pressured into ending their lives, but today the House of Lords will debate a bill about it. Similar bills have been defeated in the past but it would give new rights to terminally ill adults in England and Wales. It wouldn’t have helped Isabel, who did not have a terminal diagnosis, but her family feel it is at least a start. In her last taped moments last Thursday, Isabel spoke of her wish to see things change at home, telling the Dignitas volunteers: “I think it is absolutely wonderful. I only wish that you could have more permission to do it for other people and other people could have the means to be able to do it... I think it’s very unfair.  “I was very lucky in that I managed to do lots of things, swimming, and I also travelled a great deal... “But I feel I am  now and I feel like I have had the good fortune to be so well and to have the fun that I’ve had.” Isabel did suffer from declining eyesight and Alzheimer’s but to her she was in good health. “I haven’t anything really wrong except from old age, my hands are going funny and legs are going funny and I can’t walk the same. I need help and it is just time to go. “I just wish that other people could have the wonderful help, obviously from my family but also from Dignitas because there is a time to go. “To lose your capacity and things like that, is very wrong... very sad.” Talking about losing a best friend in a home and a relative who died of dementia, she said: “To see the effect on the family, she had a very, very, good son looking after her and he didn’t know where she was. “When I saw that I thought ‘no way’... it’s very sad because you are not in control of yourself. So therefore with the relative I had, they would come home and she would be out wandering and I saw that and I never wanted to reach that stage.  “But I do want to praise Dignitas. I just wish more older people could have this opportunity.” Then Isabel and Stephanie discuss the logistics of assisted dying. They say it took them two years to get the paperwork sorted out, and have medical reports compiled, and that it all cost around £,. Stephanie explains on the tape how the process has “not been easy”. During that time they had some lovely family meals and it would have been great to have gone home and done it there. Her mum added: “It is a great shame to see how many old people there are in the world today, and not just old people, where their quality of le is not feasible for them. There ought to be help for them and there isn’t.” Isabel then asks the nurses: “Do you find more people are coming now ” The Dignitas nurse tells her: “About the same. In Autumn there are always more than in the summer time.” Stephanie plans to have Isabel’s ashes scattered in her beloved East Africa where she was once an education boss for the Commonwealth. Isabel says: “My happiest days were there. I taught Africans and I helped build schools.” The nurse brings the final dose and asksIsabel wants to move to the bed or an electronic chair which is “great for sleeping”.  Stephanie says: “Thank you for everything you’ve done for me...” The Dignitas nurse says: “I say goodbye. Have a good trip to Africa...” Then in the one moment of total seriousness Isabel says her final words to her daughter: “Bye, thank you, bye love. I want you to be happy, it hasn’t been an easy le for you and the thought of you really enjoying yourself means a great deal to me... don’t work so hard as you do. “Enjoy, laugh and have fun...” Turning to the room she takes the last drink and says “Prost” , before adding: “That wasn’t bad!” Minutes later she takes her last breath. Talking to the Mirror after ing home alone, Stephanie said: “I’m not sad at all. I’m so glad she’s free but I just have this massive empty space inside me, I feel sick. “She was a very strong, independent woman and brave. She was brave to the end.” Comment MORE ON DignitasAssisted suicide\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The news site Atinkanews reports that the donations have been used to send Ellie to a school for children with special needs at the Ubumwe Community Center, Gisenyi, Rwanda.

The Taliban does not allow women to play sport under their rule, and since taking control made it clear that it was a punishable offence to take part.  Coach Suraya Afzali says she was captured having failed to escape Afghanistan after the collapse of the previous government. But conflicting reports on social media said she had been mysteriously killed a week before the Taliban ed to power. All the players of the volleyball team and the rest of the women athletes are in a bad situation and they are in despair and live in fear, he said in the interview. Everyone has been forced to flee and live in unknown places. The new all-male Taliban government was formed earlier this year, with women excluded.  A spokesperson for the group says they should restrict themselves to aposgiving birthapos - and steer clear of politics and sport. According to an official in the hardline Islamist group, women won’t be allowed to ‘expose them or their bodies to the media’ by taking part in matches. The deputy head of the Taliban’s cultural commission said women’s sport was considered neither appropriate - or necessary. Ahmadullah Wasiq defended the decision to Australian broadcaster SBS. “I don’t think women will be allowed to play cricket because it is not necessary that women should play cricket,” Wasiq said.  “In cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered. Islam does not allow women to be seen like this. “It is the media era, and there will be photos and videos, and then people watch it. Islam and the Islamic Emirate do not allow women to play cricket or play the kind of sports where they get exposed.” Zahra Fayazi, a member of senior volleyball team who fled to the UK in August, described last month how a fellow player had been murdered by the Taliban.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

defeat.And last Saturday#s defeat came about through a goal each in the early and late stages of the match, despite a strong showing from the Kintyre Park side.Playing in a ---, Tarbert#s Craig Johnstone ed to central defence and John McCallum played on the left wing in place of the unavailable Rhys Casci, while Liam Renton ed to the fray on the right of the front three, in place of the injured Ross Brown.To compound all the chopping and changing of the team beforehand – a common feature of Pupils# line-ups due to injuries and work commitments in recent weeks – the Kintyre side suffered a huge setback on the pitch after two minutes.A Finnart corner, for all the world a Pupils# goal kick, was awarded by the referee, and the visitors# near-post delivery was flicked on and erted into the net by a Finnart head at the back post.Although the award of the corner was thought to be unjust, the home side was left reflecting on a set piece which could have been defended much better.The McFadyens-sponsored Pupils gradually settled into the game after this early shock and enjoyed decent spells of possession,perhaps only resulting in half-chances at goal – notably through a Scott Souden header which went narrowly by the post – throughout a tightly-contested first half.After the interval, the Pupils continued to press for an equaliser, but their battle-hardened visitors, who have enjoyed the winning habit for most of this season so far, were well organised in defence, with experienced substitutes adding a calmness to their play.Nevertheless, working hard in search of an equaliser, the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils had a foray into the Finnart box midway through the second half when Stuart Crossan played in John McCallum with a deft flick, but the latter#s right-footed shot flashed wide of the Finnart goal.McCallum found space in the box again soon after and cut the ball back to Scott Souden, a little too far behind, but was bailed out by the onrushing Liam Renton, who looked to have the goal at his mercy, but somehow a Finnart defender got back to block the close-range effort.Meanwhile, Pupils captain Keith Mitchell had switched from a midfield berth to left back during the second half, and the change was bearing fruit with a good deal of the Pupils# play developing down this flank.However, more frustration was to follow for the home side in the rd minute, as the Pupils# defence was exposed in a two-vs-one situation and an unmarked Finnart forward latched on to a through-ball and lashed a shot beyond young Pupils #keeper Alasdair Ferguson to give the visitors an unassailable - lead with so little time remaining.It was a bitter blow for the home side having put so much effort into earning at least a point, but hopefully it can be taken as another lesson in game management from an experienced and well-drilled opponent.Tomorrow , the Pupils are on their travels, taking on Paisley outfit Glenvale FC on league duty at the town#s Ferguslie Park.

Look out for the third and final piece in next week#s paper.Wartime needs created additional traffic and pressures for the two main operators, thereafter, once into peacetime, West Coast Motors and its rival were able to modernise their fleets.McConnachie#s stole a march by bringing Kintyre#s first double decker to the town in , buying two more in the late s which older residents may still remember. However, failing general economics resulted in West Coast acquiring this business in . These #deckers never ran for West Coast and it would be more than  years later before such buses entered their fleet.Liveries iniably provide a recognisable identity for any bus operator and West Coast is no exception. The flowering of the company#s one surely came to its climax in the s with the flowing combination of ivory, red and maroon, set off by polished body trim lines and wheel embellishers. Styles continue to evolve but, in the opinion of this writer, no other Scottish operator has chosen a more distinctive colour scheme than West Coast which still uses two of those principal colours, ivory and red, which it bestowed on its buses  years earlier.During the s and s, West Coast#s modern vehicles were typical examples of their time. In the latter period, new bus grants were obtainable under certain conditions resulting in some splendid coaches being purchased.In post war years, the company gradually built on its service network in Kintyre and Mid Argyll. In , it picked up the East Loch – West Loch Tarbert mail ship link from Tarbert-based Dickies then the Tarbert – Kilberry service from McEacherns in , the Lochgilphead Tayvallich service from McLachans in  and, perhaps somewhat prophetically, the Benderloch-based operations of McColls in .Without doubt, the most signicant developments in West Coast#s history occurred in the - period. During the s, William Craig had attempted to introduce a direct Campbeltown to Glasgow service but failed in this ambition then and at later attempts. Finally, in , these hopes were realised when the company became a joint operator, with Scottish Citylink, of the through service between the two locations.The s continued to see signicant developments. Firstly the acquisition, also in , of the buses and Mid Argyll routes operated by Lochgilphead-based Stag Garage. This was followed, a year later, by the purchase of the old MacBrayne garage in Ardrishaig, giving West Coast an excellent base in the area.The early s saw a further involvement in Oban when West Coast secured responsibility for the Oban to Glasgow service and by  it had acquired the former Alexanders depot in Oban enabling it to build further on its already signicant presence in Argyll.Since , the rate of change has quickened further. West Coast secured the Cowal and Bute area contracts and depots in  and when Bowmans, the long-established Mull services operator retired in , West Coast added this to its portfolio. Their Oban base allows vehicle and manpower deployments on Mullneeded. Of the major Argyll islands, only Islay remains independently served by the Mundell concern of Tarbert, whose lorries are also a familiar sight in the county."},{"url":null,"title":"arkell takes dunaverty golf clubs october medal","story":"Lee Mathieson, first man out, took full advantage of the conditions to record the lowest gross score of the day.He completed the first nine in  strokes which included three birdies and one bogey.Despite having a double bogey at the th and a bogey at the th, two birdies on the way back helped him to  strokes.Donald MacNeil was next best, concluding his round in  strokes, having had two bogies on the front and back nines.James Finlay, out in the sixth group, set a nett target of  for those following him to chase.Match secretary Alex Arkell responded in exemplary fashion by not only posting the third lowest gross score of  but also taking the lead from James with a winning nett .Result:  Alex Arkell -

with  minutes played, after a long-range effort arced beyond Ferguson into his top right-hand corner, after nicking off a Pupils defender.Then, on  minutes, the sixth and final Rossvale goal was scored after Ferguson#s save from a striker#s shot rebounded off the post and into the path of a grateful Rossvale winger, who slotted into the net from point-blank range.Overall, the Pupils can reflect on a respectable cup performance,not a giant-killing, against an established semi-professional outfit, especially with an injury-ravaged squad, as the Kintyre Park club adapts to its busiest fixture schedule in its years in amateur football, with  competitive matches already played by mid-October.Despite the heavy defeat for the Pupils on the field, one notable footnote to the game was the presence of former Tarbert AFC and Pupils player Reverend John McGregor, who is club chaplain for Rossvale, having performed the same role at Dumbarton FC in previous years.After the match, he met and chatted with the Pupils management and the current Pupils squad#s Tarbert contingent, Lewis McNaughton and Rhys Casci.Tomorrow, Saturday, the Pupils are back on league duty, travelling to Paisley to play St Peter#s FC.

He was a morphine addict who destroyed his prospects as a doctor.ldquoHe used to have practices in Rotherfield, where he murdered Hubert, but he had to leave because he was so addicted to morphine.ldquoHe could not handle the practice anymore and moved to Bournemouth and became incapable of running his practice.Dr Bondeson, , is no stranger to writing about gruesome murders.Earlier this year, he told the story of a dozen unsolved murders in London, including that of prostitute Harriet Buswell, who was killed on Christmas Day.It was during the writing of that book, which was reissued this year, that he came across the story of Dr Lamson.Dr Bondeson said: ldquoBack in  or , I wrote a book called Victorian Murders about ious murders in Victorian times.ldquoDr Lamson was one of the cases and I was surprised how much new material could be found about him.ldquoThere had not been a modern study of him in the last  years and it seemed a good idea to remedy that and write a story of Dr Lamson using modern research, as well as files from the National Archives in Kew.Dr Lamson had been a military doctor before taking on the medical practice in Rotherfield, East Sussex.After he married, he gained two brothers-in-law: Hubert, who had tuberculosis, and Percy, who had scoliosis.In , during a family gathering, Hubert died suddenly, with his cause of death listed as pulmonary consumption and amyloid degeneration.Just two years later, Dr Lamson persuaded Percy to swallow a gelatine capsule, with forensic scientists later finding he had been poisoned with the uncommon vegetable toxin aconitine.Dr Lamson was later found guilty of murder and sentenced to death.Dr Bondeson said: ldquoDuring his criminous and wasted le, Dr Lamson had accomplished some good but also much wickedness short and evil had been his days, as he stood on the scaffold counting one or two more seconds, the longest-lasting in his le, waiting for the drop to open.ldquoThe police detectives, and even Lamsonrsquos barrister Montagu Williams, felt certain that Dr Lamson was a double murderer, having poisoned both his brothers-in-law for the sake of profit.ldquoComparing his

The orchestra, under Head of Music Derek Clark, is in superb form, with new recruits making their main house debuts, and there is a full chorus, drilled to perfection by choreographer Isabel Baquero.Stuart Maunderrsquos production is the work of a man in love with this repertoire, and he has won performances from cast members young and old to match. As the boatmen, Mark Nathan and William Morgan are a terric duo, Ben McAteer is a panto-tastic Grand Inquisitor, veteran GS hand Richard Suart nails The Duke of Plaza-Toro to perfection, and Catriona Hewitson is vocally outstanding as his daughter Casilda.But there are no weak links in this cast and the productionrsquos triumph is as an ensemble piece, where no-one puts a foot wrong. Perhaps Suartrsquos updating of the Dukersquos political musings to reference the current incumbent of Downing Street feels a little shoe-horned-in , but that is a minor quibble.The peculiar cleverness of GS is that it is simultaneously pertinent and quaintly dated, and that is even more true of this packagersquos companion piece, using the same cast on a simplied version of the same set, in what is rather more than a concert performance but less than a fully-stage one.

The vessel design is broadly based on our larger loch class vessels, which are double-ended.“Once the designs are approved, we will move to the next stage of the project, which will see the build of the engine to be used in feasibility studies.“The maritime industry has a key role in the global fight for climate change, and this project marks a step toward emissions-free marine transport.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There was great delight all round as the men filed into Ballymena Bowling Club on Monday, October  - and the it’s great to be back mood was evident in the singing. For some of the choir members this was the first time in  months that they had seen or spoken to each other - evenit was with a face mask and making sure they remained socially distanced!During this first practice the men were seated a good distance apart making sure everyone was safe. It did result in reducing the maximum numbers that could be accommodated in the room at one time so that the st and nd Tenors were only present for the first hour and the combined Bass section in the second hour.Everyone expressed how great it was to be able to sing along with the piano again, being ably played by our accompanist, Leah Greer and once more listening to detailed instructions from our Musical Director, Rea Sheils. “This past  months has been a dficult time for everyone and the choir is no exception,” outlined a choir spokesman.“But there is no doubt there were smiles under those masks from those who attended.”And the choir sends out a special invite!“If you enjoy singing and would like to come along, we meet every Monday night in the Bowling Club. You will be made very welcome,” concluded the spokesman.

There was a strong local representation too with young people from schools right across Armagh involved in proceedings. Organised by the Church Leaders Group , the Church of Ireland and Roman Catholic Archbishops of Armagh, the Presbyterian Moderator, the President of the Methodist Church and President of the Irish Council of Churches all had a hand in the service. A heavy police cordon was in effect in Armagh and around St Patricks Cathedral from the early hours of the morning. Media from across Ireland had descended on the city for the service too, which was televised across the UK on the BBC and across Ireland on RTE. Before the service began, the Assistant Organist, the Revd Canon Dr Peter Thompson, played as guests arrived. The Cathedral bells rang as dignitaries arrived, including the Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney and the leaders of the DUP, UUP, Alliance and SDLP. The Queen, who was unable to attend, was represented by the Earl of Caledon. The opening hymn of the service O Christ the same through all our storys pages - played to the melody of Londonderry Air - was followed by a reading of scripture by the recently appointed Dean of Armagh, the Very Revd Shane Forster.  He read  Corinthians :-: Soanyone is in Christ, there is a new creation: everything old has passed away see, everything has become new! All this is from God who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting the message of reconciliation to us. The Dean also welcomed everyone to the service. We gather here today on this ancient hill of Armagh, where St Patrick established a faith community and church over fteen hundred years ago, to reflect on the signicance of this centenary year and the long road we have travelled which also stretches out before us, he said. In this the ecclesiastical capital of this island, a centuries old place of learning and outreach, we meet together at this time, people from erse backgrounds and traditions, with dferent beliefs and aspirations, to pray for the healing of past hurts and to seek God’s guidance and hope for the future.  Our past has shaped us and scarred us, it has ided us, and yet it has also on occasion brought us together. As we lament our failures, sorrows and pain, and recognise our wounded yet living history, may we with a united voice commit ourselves to work together for the common good, in mutual respect and with shared hope for a light filled, prosperous and peaceful future. His following prayer spoke of how we as a people had wounded each other and our communities in the past. We are sorry and ashamed and asked for your forgiveness, so that together we may move forward in faith, grow together in love, and faithfully serve you all our days. Soloist Helena Hendron, accompanied by the gentlemen of the Cathedral Choir, sang The Deers Cry, before a reading from Isiah :- by Rebecca Morris. A song of hope, Were the Future of Tomorrow, was sung by a childrens choir drawn from the local area. That was followed by a reading from St Matthew :- by Oisiacuten Walsh. The hopes, dreams and aspirations of the next generation were then given to the congregation by Lucy Addis from the Royal School, Armagh, Sean McCourt-Kelly from St Patrick’s High School, Keady, and Andrea Andrews, a pupil of La Cheacuteile Secondary School in Tyrrelstown in Dublin. Prayers were read, with the opening prayer read in Irish by Linda Ervine and Seacutean Cull. Intercessions were offered by Professor Mary Hannon-Fletcher and Robert Barfoot, both of whom were injured in the conflict. Reflections were then given by the Church Leaders, with the exception of the Methodist Leader, who was giving the sermon later. ‘In Christ Alone’, a hymn written by Stuart Townend and Keith Getty, who has links to the Armagh area, was then sung by the congregation. Rev’d Dr Sahr Yambasu, President of the Methodist Church in Ireland, then gave his sermon, followed by the Act of Commitment, led by Rosa McCloskey and James Chamberlain, a pupil of Markethill High School. The most symbolic act of the service saw Billy Wilson, a pupil of City of Armagh High School, carry a lantern, representing a light of hope, through the Cathedral where it was received in the santuary by the Church Leaders. Billy was accompanied by Libby Harrison from Saints and Scholars Primary School, Erika Stancuite of Mount St Catherines Primary School and Alfie Cummings who attends Armstrong Primary School. Blessings sung by the Cathedral Choir and given by the Church Leaders, then took place, before the final hymn, ‘Be Thou My Vision’."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1591282097106.jpg--covid_19_figures__thursday__october_21__2021.jpg?1591282097000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211021newscovid 19 figures thursday october 21 2021","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

He said failure to act against “this blatant breach” would make a mockery of the church.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “May the Lord have mercy on His people in Ulster who have been given such poor spiritual and political leadership in these evil times,” he said.The DUP has been asked for a response. When contacted, Rev Foster said he would leave it to the Free Presbyterian Church to decidethere would be any internal sanctions against Mr Givan.He was asked why Paul Givan shouldn’t attend as First Minister when the Queen had felt it was appropriate before taking ill. “The Queen is not a Free Presbyterian,” he said. “The Queen is not someone who has sat up and said ‘I believe in the doctrines of the Free Presbyterian Church’.“She’s the head of the Church of England which is a dogsbody for every form of filthiness. That’s the truth, theologically speaking.”Rev Foster added that he “lamented” the appetite for protest from his church had dropped away in recent years since former First Minister and Free Presbyterian founder, former DUP leader Rev Ian Paisley, performed a “political somersault and entered into an alliance with Sinn Fein”.Those attending Thursday’s widely reported event also included Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney as well as the leaders of the DUP, UUP and SDLP.Free Presbyterian Moderator Rev John Armstrong recently said that “this upcoming event has been arranged to promote the purposes of unscriptural ecumenism when it ought to have been a service of celebration and thanksgiving for the Lord’s hand upon our country over the past  years”.Read MoreAlf McCreary:OpinionSadly, the absence of the Queen and Michael D Higgins will be remembered long after centenary church service eventRelated topicsPaul GivanUlster Unionist PartySDLPBoris JohnsonSimon CoveneyMost ReadGivan slammed by reverend for taking part in ‘unbiblical’ serviceWatch: Daniel O’Donnell’s new tropical music video ‘cheers up’ viewers worldwide‘I hope we have learned lessons’ says DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson following NI centenary church serviceNI high street voucher: , given seven days to confirm identity to receive Spend Local cardArlene Foster attends former NI Secretary James Brokenshire’s funeralLatest Northern IrelandEimear McGovernOpinionAre we asking too much of the Queen NI health service facing ‘most dficult winter ever’Emergency call for sub teachers as special schools face staffing crisisEducation trial aims to tackle underachievement of boysAdele ‘pushed’ me down the charts, jokes Daniel O’DonnellLatestStephen CraiganOpinionIt’s no surprise to me that Newcastle will look at Steven Gerrard as new managerEimear McGovernOpinionAre we asking too much of the Queen Domestic abuse victims to be given more time to go to policeKitten Tiny Tim ‘doing amazingly’ after being found alone in garden at week oldPep Guardiola sympathises with Steve Bruce and urges him to ignore social media,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Age is not the only issue, with expensive training and tests also a barrier to younger lorry drivers.Economy Minister Gordon Lyons MLA spoke at Thursday’s event organised by the Road Haulage Association , .“All too often we take for granted what’s done throughout Northern Ireland in bringing all the goods in that we rely on here every single day,” he said.He said he is keen to see people view the industry as “one that has a future and that has good career prospects”. But he added: “That hasn’t always been the case. And I want to send a message today that this is a sector that’s open to everyone regardless of your gender or background because it’s a fantastic sector to work in.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “I understand the changes that need to take place as well, in relation to conditions in particular, but we are committed as an Executive to doing all that we can to support this sector.”A skills shortage report by the Freight Transport Association in  showed that although only around % of those taking the practical truck driving test are women, their pass rate is consistently higher than their male counterparts.Anne Murrayfrom Portadown started out working in accounts and admin for Manfreight. “I’ve been working in the industry the past couple of years but when I started working in the garage I wanted a bit more knowledge because when you’re asked things by drivers it’s kind of good to know what you’re talking about!” she said.Anne was helped by fleet manager and Manfreight instructor, Steven Heasley to complete her medical, theory, hazard perception and practical tests.The Co Armagh woman is now able to drive lorries to maintenance and service checks and said she “really enjoys it” – and “it’s easier than it looks”.But she added: “It’s quite expensive sothere were incentives to help pay for the test fees or training fees in order to get the industry back up and running, I think more people would give it a go.”Belfast City Council launched employment academies for the unemployed over five years ago, including a transport and logistics academy which offers job opportunities and training.   Chris Tubridy, who heads it, said there is extremely competitive demand for drivers but the expense of the licence itself is where the problem lies, costing on average over £, per test.“There are more than three jobs for every participant that’s on our course,” he said. “But to get through the course and gain your full licence is an expensive process for those without help.”Student Lydia Grfithadded that the process to become a driver can be rather y as well.“The induction was at the end of June for the course this year, then you have to wait five weeks for your provisional back. Then I unfortunately failed my theory, so I now have to wait another eight weeks on a resit,” she said.“If things like that were speeded up a bit by the Driver and Vehicle Agency , more drivers would be coming through the course a lot quicker and into employment. All it is realistically is a wee line on your license and it takes five weeks to do.”Michael Strain, CEO of Transport Training Services launched a ‘Women in Wheels’ apprenticeship programme last year.Mr Strain said that there is also a certain “barrier” with younger people and employers where some don’t accept drivers over the age of .“Realisticallyyou start driving earlier, and you already have a full driving license, there is no reason why you can’t learn to drive a lorry too,” he said.“Haulage and lorry driving is an ageing career, and we need to change that. The average age of a lorry driver in the UK, including Northern Ireland, is , with only % under the age of ,” he added.“We need the Department for the Economy to now push the value of these apprenticeship programmes and get young lorry drivers and mechanics back to work.”Related topicsGordon LyonsBelfast City CouncilDepartment for the EconomyMore On Gordon Lyons PremiumNI holiday at home voucher scheme may be scrapped, warns Gordon LyonsNI High Street Voucher: Over , people yet to apply for Spend Local CardGordon LyonsOpinionNI voucher scheme- No one should be made to feel guilty about this business boost PremiumMallon urges UK and Irish government intervention over DUP north-south boycottEconomy Minister sets aside another £m for high street vouchersMost ReadGivan slammed by reverend for taking part in ‘unbiblical’ serviceWatch: Daniel O’Donnell’s new tropical music video ‘cheers up’ viewers worldwide‘I hope we have learned lessons’ says DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson following NI centenary church serviceNI high street voucher: , given seven days to confirm identity to receive Spend Local cardArlene Foster attends former NI Secretary James Brokenshire’s funeralLatest Northern IrelandEimear McGovernOpinionAre we asking too much of the Queen NI health service facing ‘most dficult winter ever’Emergency call for sub teachers as special schools face staffing crisisEducation trial aims to tackle underachievement of boysAdele ‘pushed’ me down the charts, jokes Daniel O’DonnellLatestStephen CraiganOpinionIt’s no surprise to me that Newcastle will look at Steven Gerrard as new managerEimear McGovernOpinionAre we asking too much of the Queen Newcastle interim boss Graeme Jones to bring positive approach whilst in chargeFIFA’s international calendar plans rejected by European LeaguesGang members guilty of killing which sparked tit-for-tat shooting,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Stock imageAmy CochraneTwitterEmailOctober   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailNorthern Ireland farmers have said that a new trade deal struck by the UK and New Zealand could “severely undermine” the market in Northern Ireland by allowing an influx of cheaper meat to be imported.The Ulster Farmers Union added that the family farm structure here has become “vulnerable practically overnight” and certain farming sectors have been “sold-out”.The deal allows New Zealand farmers to undercut British farmers by shipping in meat produced to lower welfare standards.It has been suggested that the deal could reduce the size of the UK economy, but with the effects unlikely to spread evenly, it could mean that Northern Ireland – which depends highly on the agriculture industry – could be hit worst.UFU president Victor Chestnutt said: “UK farming and local food production has been completely undermined by this New Zealand trade deal.“Combined with the Australia agreement at the beginning of this year, government has granted access to a signicant increase of imported food allowing it into our market, with no guarantees about how it was produced orit meets our world leading standards.”Mr Chestnutt said that it is “extremely concerning” for the red meat, dairy and horticulture farm sectors and for the public.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “Our consumers – who take pride in supporting local farmers for the work that they do producing high-quality, trustworthy, local food, looking after the environment and boosting employment in rural areas – have been sold out too,” he said.“No attempt of communication was made by government as to how they would work to protect our local food production while trying to get a trade deal with New Zealand over the line.“Farm businesses across Northern Ireland and the whole of the UK, are already enduring substantially higher input costs in comparison to those farmers on the other side of the world and are dealing with ongoing labour availability.“It seems that government are either oblivious to what farmers are dealing with or have chosen to dismiss it as they have created unfair competition within our home market which will affect the sustainability of our family farms in years to come.”The UFU president is now urging the British government to adopt similar approaches to New Zealand and Australia, which invest in strategic farming, in order to safeguard and strengthen British agri-food production.“As it stands, it is very hard to see the positives of this trade deal and other countries will be watching this development with a growing drive to secure a similar agreement,” said Mr Chestnutt. “Government must explain the rationale behind this new trade deal with New Zealand immediately, highlighting how it will benefit UK agriculture, our world leading standards and the future of local food production.”Most ReadGivan slammed by reverend for taking part in ‘unbiblical’ serviceWatch: Daniel O’Donnell’s new tropical music video ‘cheers up’ viewers worldwide‘I hope we have learned lessons’ says DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson following NI centenary church serviceNI high street voucher: , given seven days to confirm identity to receive Spend Local cardArlene Foster attends former NI Secretary James Brokenshire’s funeralLatest Northern IrelandEimear McGovernOpinionAre we asking too much of the Queen NI health service facing ‘most dficult winter ever’Emergency call for sub teachers as special schools face staffing crisisEducation trial aims to tackle underachievement of boysAdele ‘pushed’ me down the charts, jokes Daniel O’DonnellLatestEimear McGovernOpinionAre we asking too much of the Queen Ministers accused of backing ‘bad bosses’ as fire and rehire reforms blockedGerhard Erasmus ends Ireland T World Cup hopes as Namibia reach Super  stageFire chief cleared of fraud over £ Land Rover auction saleBoy, , in court charged with murder of five-year-old Logan Mwangi,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It comes as part of the Northern Irelands Executives winter Covid contingency plans. The Executive said there was a need to keep as many sectors open to the fullest possible extent. First Minister, Paul Givan said doing that would depend on as many people as possible getting vaccinated.” googletag.cmd.push Just over % of people aged  and above in Northern Ireland had received one dose of the vaccine. Mr Givan said: Our vaccination rates are very good but there is still room for improvement.” Further Covid restrictions are due to be relaxed by the Executive onOctober . This will allow for nightclubs to reopen, restrictions on indoor dancing lted and the requirement to be seated in hospitality to drink and eat food will no longer be in place. Mr Givan said it was a fact of le that Covid remains an ongoing issue, and that the Executive needed to continue to find ways to manage the situation.     The First Minister says that the Executive will launch a new public information campaign before the end of October to build on the need for all of us to keep making safer choices.

Owner and barber, Claire Elish Craig, was nominated by herdaughter, Chloe, who posted on Facebook for Clare’s clients to fill out a survey and allow for Clare and her barbers to be nominated. googletag.cmd.push The decision is now down to an external judging  after Clare submits supporting evidence for her nomination. Clare said that the response to the survey andnominationfrom her local clients was “overwhelming. The business, open since , is Clare’s first barber shop. She said: “I have been hairdressing and barbering since I left school, some  years ago now. “I trained with James McGarvey who was my old mentor and master barber. He retired at the age of , that’s when I went out on my own. “I went on to do my advanced level and accessor award in barbering. I have given my all to this trade.     “I feel I have carried a lot of the values over from James offering value for money and a friendly ear for our customers.” Clare’s husband, Michael, has been a great support for her business, “My husband has his own job working with special needs children inArdansheeschool, but he is always organising things for me, my back bone.” The Derry couplehavethree children, and now threegrandchildren. Clare says her first born granddaughteris “a shining light.” Clare said: “She has shown us that nothing is impossible with all the obstacles that she overcomes. “Through the past year and a half, it’s been a nightmare for business. “We were closed for months, then opened briefly, then closed again. The cost to make the shop safe for customers, mentally, I thought, is this it  Will we ever be able to get back to business  Will the business still be there whenever we are allowed to open  “I was extremely scared with Covid when it was time to open again. I kept asking, will my customers be safe  Will my staff be safe  Am I doing the right thing  It was definitely very tough.” When asked what winning the award would mean to her, Clare said: “All the years barbering, to me personally, it would mean the world. “A lot of my clientswho were teenagers when I started, are now coming with their own children.

Owner and barber, Claire Elish Craig, was nominated by herdaughter, Chloe, who posted on Facebook for Clare’s clients to fill out a survey and allow for Clare and her barbers to be nominated. googletag.cmd.push The decision is now down to an external judging  after Clare submits supporting evidence for her nomination. Clare said that the response to the survey andnominationfrom her local clients was “overwhelming. The business, open since , is Clare’s first barber shop. She said: “I have been hairdressing and barbering since I left school, some  years ago now. “I trained with James McGarvey who was my old mentor and master barber. He retired at the age of , that’s when I went out on my own. “I went on to do my advanced level and accessor award in barbering. I have given my all to this trade.     “I feel I have carried a lot of the values over from James offering value for money and a friendly ear for our customers.” Clare’s husband, Michael, has been a great support for her business, “My husband has his own job working with special needs children inArdansheeschool, but he is always organising things for me, my back bone.” The Derry couplehavethree children, and now threegrandchildren. Clare says her first born granddaughteris “a shining light.” Clare said: “She has shown us that nothing is impossible with all the obstacles that she overcomes. “Through the past year and a half, it’s been a nightmare for business. “We were closed for months, then opened briefly, then closed again. The cost to make the shop safe for customers, mentally, I thought, is this it  Will we ever be able to get back to business  Will the business still be there whenever we are allowed to open  “I was extremely scared with Covid when it was time to open again. I kept asking, will my customers be safe  Will my staff be safe  Am I doing the right thing  It was definitely very tough.” When asked what winning the award would mean to her, Clare said: “All the years barbering, to me personally, it would mean the world. “A lot of my clientswho were teenagers when I started, are now coming with their own children. In some cases, I have three to four generations from the samefamily. “My shop is just not another shop, it’s an integrationinto the local community where people come to have ahaircut,a chat, unload their worries, and I to them, and they sometimes have the occasional beer.” The award ceremony will beheld December  at the Europa Hotel in Belfast.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm.     When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Michelle Devine at The Cottage Coffee Shop with their awards Derry NewsDerry cafeacute takes home top prize for best scones in the country overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArrest made in drugs operation linked to INLA in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Thursday, st October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City super fan - the late Hugh Curran.SoccerCandystripe legends to honour Derry City super fan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police in Derry appeal for anyone who believes they have had their drink spiked last weekend to contact themDerry NewsPolice appealing for anyone who believes they had their drink spiked while out in Derry city-centre last weekend to contact them overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  New Eurospar opens on Clooney RoadDerry NewsNew Eurospar opens on Clooney Road overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Proposals would see Claudy moved from the Foyle to East Derry constituencyCounty Derry PostFoyle to lose Eglinton and Claudy in proposed boundaries shake-up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportDerry junior hurling final cancelled overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMurdered County Derry man was victim of alleged assault last year overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Michelle Devine at The Cottage Coffee Shop with their awards Derry NewsDerry cafeacute takes home top prize for best scones in the country overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArrest made in drugs operation linked to INLA in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Thursday, st October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City super fan - the late Hugh Curran.SoccerCandystripe legends to honour Derry City super fan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police in Derry appeal for anyone who believes they have had their drink spiked last weekend to contact themDerry NewsPolice appealing for anyone who believes they had their drink spiked while out in Derry city-centre last weekend to contact them overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  New Eurospar opens on Clooney RoadDerry NewsNew Eurospar opens on Clooney Road overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Proposals would see Claudy moved from the Foyle to East Derry constituencyCounty Derry PostFoyle to lose Eglinton and Claudy in proposed boundaries shake-up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportDerry junior hurling final cancelled overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMurdered County Derry man was victim of alleged assault last year overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Reporter: Michael McMullan Oct   addthis, JUNIOR FINALColeraine v Na Magha -Sunday– OwenbegRef: Niall Clford Sundays junior final is a repeat of the  final when Deaglan Foleys point in an inspired second-half display saw city side Na Magha earn a - to - draw. Colm McGoldrick and Niall Holly scored Eoghan Ruas goals in a game that was sandwiched between their drawn football and their replay win that ended the Emmets hopes of clinching five in a row. googletag.cmd.push After winning the Ulster junior in , the Coleraine club werent allowed to compete in the Ulster series until the following year when they won Ulster again in , so it will be Na Magha who will take on the Cavan champions when the provincial series begins at the end of November, Coleraine were on the wrong end of a thumping by Swatragh in this years qualying round, losing - to - with the Davitts also hitting  wides. Liam McGoldrick, currently working in London, was absent. So too are Aidan Boyle, Niall Holly, Ciaran and Barry McGoldrick, while Ruairi Mooney came on late in the game, one of only two subs.     Na Maghas qualier with Ballinasccreen was a total contrast, as they gave Screen the scare of their lives, despite missing top scorer from the league, Tim Rankin. Cathal McDaids side were - to - up at half-time, but had no answer to a resurgent Na Magha side in the third quarter.Michael Lynch and Tomaacutes Lally ran riot from deep, with Deaglan Foley beginning to find his range. It wasnt until the second water break that the momentum began to change. If Na Magha are to launch an assault on the Ulster title, a performance and silverware would be a great start on Sunday.

Reporter: Michael McMullan Oct   addthis, JUNIOR FINALColeraine v Na Magha -Sunday– OwenbegRef: Niall Clford Sundays junior final is a repeat of the  final when Deaglan Foleys point in an inspired second-half display saw city side Na Magha earn a - to - draw. Colm McGoldrick and Niall Holly scored Eoghan Ruas goals in a game that was sandwiched between their drawn football and their replay win that ended the Emmets hopes of clinching five in a row. googletag.cmd.push After winning the Ulster junior in , the Coleraine club werent allowed to compete in the Ulster series until the following year when they won Ulster again in , so it will be Na Magha who will take on the Cavan champions when the provincial series begins at the end of November, Coleraine were on the wrong end of a thumping by Swatragh in this years qualying round, losing - to - with the Davitts also hitting  wides. Liam McGoldrick, currently working in London, was absent. So too are Aidan Boyle, Niall Holly, Ciaran and Barry McGoldrick, while Ruairi Mooney came on late in the game, one of only two subs.     Na Maghas qualier with Ballinasccreen was a total contrast, as they gave Screen the scare of their lives, despite missing top scorer from the league, Tim Rankin. Cathal McDaids side were - to - up at half-time, but had no answer to a resurgent Na Magha side in the third quarter.Michael Lynch and Tomaacutes Lally ran riot from deep, with Deaglan Foley beginning to find his range. It wasnt until the second water break that the momentum began to change. If Na Magha are to launch an assault on the Ulster title, a performance and silverware would be a great start on Sunday.

The scheme is a recycling initiative which he had championed during his time as Environment Minister and has worked to progress in recent years. In response to an Assembly Question tabled by Mr Durkan, the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , Edwin Poots reaffirmed his commitment to introduce the scheme, following the department’s joint consultation with DAERA and the Welsh Government. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle MLA said: “I’m pleased that work is continuing to progress a depositscheme for Northern Ireland. “This is a scheme which began work on during my time as Environment Minister, having seen their benefits in other countries. “Unfortunately, at that time my attempts were met with some resistance, both politically and commercially. “In February , the Executive supported my calls for the introduction of a depositscheme and committed to the North’s participation in a proposed UK-wide rollout. I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy.     “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment. “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Michelle Devine at The Cottage Coffee Shop with their awards Derry NewsDerry cafeacute takes home top prize for best scones in the country overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArrest made in drugs operation linked to INLA in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices -

The proposal will be voted on by members of both branches in the beginning of November.Reporter: Matthew Leslie Oct Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, A proposal to merge both the Derry and Claudy Credit Unions will be voted on by members at the start of next month. In a letter sent to members of Derrys Credit Union, the branchs President, Sean Hegarty, outlined the proposed merger and his reasons as to why this would benefit both unions googletag.cmd.push Earlier this year, the Directors of the Derry Credit Union were approached by their Claudy counterparts requesting a “transfer of engagements” to merge the two unions where the latter would switch its business to Derry. The proposal to members, which will be made at Derry Credit Unions agm on November , will be to vote on rubber-stamping the merger. Claudys members will be asked to do likewise at their own agm  hours later – a majority of members is needed to pass the proposal through. In the letter to his members, Mr Hegarty, wrote: “The merger with Claudy Credit Union will create a larger, well-resourced Derry Credit Union that will serve our combined common bond and reinforce our position as the leading credit union in Northern Ireland and in this region.     “We are excited by the opportunities that this merger will bring to our combined membership. “In coming together, we will broaden and enhance the range of services that we can offer to all our members, including additional online facilities and a wider-range of loan products. “It is you, our members, who will make the ultimate decision regarding this merger. Please take this opportunity to cast your vote and have your say in the future development of the credit union movement in the wider BT and BT postcode areas. “We firmly believe we are stronger together.” Meanwhile, Alliance Party Councillors, Rachael Fergusonand Philip McKinneyhave sent good wishes to the members of Derry and Claudy Credit Unions. “The two credit unions are considering merging together”, the Councillors said in a joint-statement. “Both Boards of Directors have approved a merger and they are recommending it to their members. And Derry Credit Union has already done its due diligence checks. So it looks like this merger will take place.” Cllr Ferguson added: “Derry Credit Union, once claimed to be the largest community-based credit union in the world, is an amazing success story. “It was founded only  years ago by  local people, with combined savings of pound.p – and now has over , members and over pound million of members savings.” Cllr McKinney said: “The whole Credit Union movement is a brilliant self-help story. “It has a proven track record across the world –  million members in over  countries.

The SDLP social justice spokesperson said timely payment of the Winter Fuel Allowance was crucial this year given rising energy costs and has called for additional support to help low-income households to heat their homes this winter. googletag.cmd.push It was announced earlier this week that gas bills would rise by  per cent with electricity going up by . Mr Durkan said: “The financial consequences borne out of the COVID pandemic are becoming clearer by the day. “Rising energy costs in conjunction with increasing financial precariousness caused by the end of furlough and the Universal Credit uplt, will force many low-income households to choose between heating or eating in the coming months. “It’s clear that a warm home during the winter period is not a luxury afforded to all and I acknowledge that support mechanisms such as the Winter Fuel Payment are in place for the older cohort.     “For those vulnerable people entitled to the Winter Fuel Payment, it will be of immense value this year in particular. “However, they cannot afford the same y delays which plagued the roll-out last year whereby some claimants weren’t receiving this vital payment until February or March. “I have written to the Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey urging her to liaise with the Department for Working Pensions who administer this scheme, to avoid a repeat of last year’s disaster. “She has given assurances that most Winter Fuel Payments will be paid automatically to qualying claimants during November and December, with all payments made by  January . “No-one should ever be left without this cold-weather crutch – this year it will provide a leline for many. “I have also appealed to Minister Hargey to explore a fuel support scheme for struggling households to mitigate against the rising costs of living compounded by the financial implications of the pandemic and cut to Universal Credit. “I understand a bid has been made and discussions have begun with the Utility Regulator and those within the sector to look into additional supports for families here.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Michelle Devine at The Cottage Coffee Shop with their awards Derry NewsDerry cafeacute takes home top prize for best scones in the country overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArrest made in drugs operation linked to INLA in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices -

Capita were requested to attend a meeting at Derry City  Strabane Council to explain errors made by the company that affected people being able to access benefits that they were entitled to. googletag.cmd.push The firm was hired by the Department of Communities in  to carry out Personal Independent Paymentassessments. However, an Ombudsman report last June found Capita had “unfairly rejected” the applications of many claimants in the north of Ireland. The Public Services Ombudsman, Margaret Kelly, said that “repeated opportunities were missed to make the right payment as early as possible in the process” with evidence from medical professionals not being sought out and used by Capita in their assessments. Brendan Flynn of Capita addressed Derry City  Strabane District Council and apologised for the firms actions. He said: “Theres always a risk that we wont get things  per cent right all of the time.     “On the occasions where things do go wrong, we apologise, and we will continue to apologise and seek to put things right as soon as we become aware of any issue where we might have failed. We look to put in place safeguards, checks and balances and the continuous improvement processes to ensure those errors dont happen again.” However, Capitas apology cut no ice with Cllr Harkin who accused the firm of acting “callously” and called on Communities Minister, Deirdre Hargey to strip them of the role of assessing benefits for people in need of them. He said: “Capitas administration of Personal Independence Paymenthas done great harm to vulnerable people seeking access to benefits.  People Before Profit demonstrating against PIP assessors Capita outside the Guildhall in Derry “The company has acted callously in its pursuit of profits. They should have no role in assessing whether or not people should be able to access any benefit. Capita isnt fit for this role. “Given Capitas atrocious record, its simply stunning that the Communities Minister decided the corporation should be rewarded with another multi-million pound contract through to . Coming into the role, axing Capita should have been number one on the list. “Its also unacceptable that the Minister refuses to implement the human rights Peoples Proposal, backed by  Councils including Derry and Strabane, to ensure dignied treatment to everyone seeking to access benefit help. “If this was a DUP Minister, Sinn Feacutein would be roasting them. Instead they tell us they have confidence in the Minister. “We are calling for Capita to hand over its profits to the Derry and Strabane hardship fund and other organisations working to mitigate the impact of poverty. “They should be ashamed to be lting profits following the devastating Public Service Ombudsman report. Companies solely interested in turning a profit shouldnt be getting their hands on extremely lucrative government contracts. “Capita needs to be booted out. The Peoples Proposal needs to be fully implemented. “We need to end the corrupt cycle of powerful corporations getting their hands on huge government contracts with the sole goal of squeezing out as much profit as possible no matter the damage caused to vulnerable people.” In response, a Capita spokesperson said: “We recognise and understand that the assessment process can be a stressful and anxious time for claimants.” “Our assessments are just one part of a wider process of evidence gathering on behalf of the Department for Communities and final PIP award decisions are made by the department. “All our assessors are qualied healthcare professionals including former NHS nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and paramedics, specially trained in assessing disability needs. The spokesperson said a sample of claimants are surveyed monthly following their PIP assessment by an independent research company. Over the last  months, more than  per cent of those surveyed have said they were satisfied or very satisfied with our service, the spokesperson said. A spokesperson for the Department for Communities said they were committed to improving the quality of PIP assessments and have already begun in doing so.

Capita were requested to attend a meeting at Derry City  Strabane Council to explain errors made by the company that affected people being able to access benefits that they were entitled to. googletag.cmd.push The firm was hired by the Department of Communities in  to carry out Personal Independent Paymentassessments. However, an Ombudsman report last June found Capita had “unfairly rejected” the applications of many claimants in the north of Ireland. The Public Services Ombudsman, Margaret Kelly, said that “repeated opportunities were missed to make the right payment as early as possible in the process” with evidence from medical professionals not being sought out and used by Capita in their assessments. Brendan Flynn of Capita addressed Derry City  Strabane District Council and apologised for the firms actions. He said: “Theres always a risk that we wont get things  per cent right all of the time.     “On the occasions where things do go wrong, we apologise, and we will continue to apologise and seek to put things right as soon as we become aware of any issue where we might have failed. We look to put in place safeguards, checks and balances and the continuous improvement processes to ensure those errors dont happen again.” However, Capitas apology cut no ice with Cllr Harkin who accused the firm of acting “callously” and called on Communities Minister, Deirdre Hargey to strip them of the role of assessing benefits for people in need of them. He said: “Capitas administration of Personal Independence Paymenthas done great harm to vulnerable people seeking access to benefits.  People Before Profit demonstrating against PIP assessors Capita outside the Guildhall in Derry “The company has acted callously in its pursuit of profits. They should have no role in assessing whether or not people should be able to access any benefit. Capita isnt fit for this role. “Given Capitas atrocious record, its simply stunning that the Communities Minister decided the corporation should be rewarded with another multi-million pound contract through to . Coming into the role, axing Capita should have been number one on the list. “Its also unacceptable that the Minister refuses to implement the human rights Peoples Proposal, backed by  Councils including Derry and Strabane, to ensure dignied treatment to everyone seeking to access benefit help. “If this was a DUP Minister, Sinn Feacutein would be roasting them. Instead they tell us they have confidence in the Minister. “We are calling for Capita to hand over its profits to the Derry and Strabane hardship fund and other organisations working to mitigate the impact of poverty. “They should be ashamed to be lting profits following the devastating Public Service Ombudsman report. Companies solely interested in turning a profit shouldnt be getting their hands on extremely lucrative government contracts. “Capita needs to be booted out. The Peoples Proposal needs to be fully implemented. “We need to end the corrupt cycle of powerful corporations getting their hands on huge government contracts with the sole goal of squeezing out as much profit as possible no matter the damage caused to vulnerable people.” In response, a Capita spokesperson said: “We recognise and understand that the assessment process can be a stressful and anxious time for claimants.” “Our assessments are just one part of a wider process of evidence gathering on behalf of the Department for Communities and final PIP award decisions are made by the department. “All our assessors are qualied healthcare professionals including former NHS nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and paramedics, specially trained in assessing disability needs. The spokesperson said a sample of claimants are surveyed monthly following their PIP assessment by an independent research company. Over the last  months, more than  per cent of those surveyed have said they were satisfied or very satisfied with our service, the spokesperson said. A spokesperson for the Department for Communities said they were committed to improving the quality of PIP assessments and have already begun in doing so. They said: “These include the completion of PIP award reviews in-house, where sufficient evidence is available. This has reduced referrals to the PIP assessment provider by  per cent. “The department also employs health professionals who monitor the quality of assessments reports, and from August  the independent audit of cases has been brought in-house to provide a more robust oversight and scrutiny of the quality of service provided. “Where assessments are required, officials are working closely with the service provider to reduce the need for a claimant to attend for assessment. “Officials are also taking forward initiatives to enhance customer service in response to independent reviews that have recently completed, including the second independent review of PIP and a review of the management of the PIP assessment service contract by the NI Audit Office.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Michelle Devine at The Cottage Coffee Shop with their awards Derry NewsDerry cafeacute takes home top prize for best scones in the country overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArrest made in drugs operation linked to INLA in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices -

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.         Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.         The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.         Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

The comments were made during a Government press conference on Tuesday October th, after the announcement of the countrysrevised reopening plan, where Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin confirmed all of the restrictions set to ease from Friday,  October and the restrictions that will remain in place. googletag.cmd.push The pandemic isnt over yet. Unfortunately, were going to have to get through at least another winter before we can safely say that its behind us, Varadkar said at the press conference. The situation took a turn for the worse about two or three weeks ago and since then, weve seen rising case numbers, rising hospitalisations and rising ICU numbers.So, were not where we hoped to be or expected to be for  October... were not past the peak of the Delta wave. Later in the press conference, he said the government would be meeting with unions and employer representatives to update the Work Safely Protocol.     Well have that done over the next couple of days and essentially what were saying is that a staggered and phasedto the office is possible, he explained. So, people going back to the office for a specic business purpose, like a meeting or a training, for example, or inductions - that is allowed. But certainly people who can work from home and want to continue to work from home, their employer should facilitate that. But bear in mind, there are also people whove been working from home with a laptop on a bed for  months now and they really want to get back to the office. Andthat can be facilitated,they can be in an office on their own or in an office where theyre socially distanced from other people, that should be facilitated too. But the fullto offices as we knew them, that will be next spring, added the Taacutenaiste. The announcement from the Taacutenaiste comes days after Deputy Chief Medical OfficerDr. Ronan Glynn advised the public towork from home where possiblethis autumn and winter.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps.     Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Michelle Devine at The Cottage Coffee Shop with their awards Derry NewsDerry cafeacute takes home top prize for best scones in the country overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArrest made in drugs operation linked to INLA in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices -

In our society, that there continues to be injustice and inequality in our healthcare system is something that should shock us out of any potential apathy that all is rosy and well.ldquoAs we emerge from the pandemic, this should awaken us to action in a collective effort to take stock of where our health service is and what can be done to bring it to where it needs to be.Mr McGrath said healthcare staff must also be a priority for everyone as, without them, the health system would simply collapse.ldquoWithin the Downe Hospital for instance, we have seen staff moved about and relocated to other hospitals within the South Eastern Trust. And while it is important that the jobs of staff are secure, itrsquos also important that they have a sense of consistency and the opportunity to advance in their careers, he said.ldquoThe sad reality is that many of our staff are now burnt out a result of their work over the past  months. We need to sort out how our healthcare heroes are paid a wage that reflects the work they do and that they have proper working conditions.Mr McGrath said taking a critical look at how the ongoing waiting list is funded is also critically important which he also described as a priority moving forward.ldquoThe simple matter is that people are having to wait too long to see a consultant and the waiting lists are getting ever longer. This cannot go on, he declared.ldquoComing from a rural constituency we need to address how rural healthcare services are delivered and methodologies such as the community pharmacy can be supported in a way that enables them to challenge our rural health care needs.ldquoWhere this concerns the Downe Hospital specically is that it is essential that we have the services that meet the needs of the community. What I hear from people on the ground is that the Downe is ready to play itrsquos role,it was only supported from central government to do so.Mr McGrath said he is also conscious that many people are fearful about the future of GP services and are concerned that they cannot see their doctor.ldquoOur GP services have never been busier and our doctors work all day, every day. But the system is broken and needs to be fixed. There are many issues that are so important and need investigated and enhanced such as mental health, youth mental health, perinatal care, cancer services and more.ldquoAs I take up my partyrsquos health spokesman role, I am fully aware of the responsibility it involves and will now be endeavouring to meet with all of those stakeholder groups who I know will be instrumental in being a part of this. Irsquoll be meeting with the public to hear their thoughts as well.Mr McGrath added: ldquoA post-Covid society offers us many opportunities, but we have to seize them and make them work.

This time it was Eilis Murphy who found her effort crossing the line after evading any resistance the Kilcoo defence had to offer.However, it was not to be plain sailing for Downpatrick, as immediately the Magpies sought to get a foothold on the contest.Kilcoo responded through a Caitriona Kane free, which was a reoccurring theme throughout the match. And one minute later, Kane once again converted from a free as her side began to enter the tie.There was a notable battle between Downpatrickrsquos Turley and Kilcoorsquos Laura Morgan, as the two tussled in what was a case of who wanted control of the possession more.Some neat triangle passing allowed Hoops forward Aisling Flynn to notch her first point of the game, before Adair Trainor overturned possession to release Cara Tumelty, who added further to RGUrsquos tally.Kilcoo displayed their class through Kane after an array of eye-catching passes found its way to the boot of the number , resulting in an applauded point.The scoreline would have been much closer at this stage had it not been for the goalkeeping heroics of player-of-the-match Kirsty Carling, who saved magnicently to deny a certain Magpies goal.Yet again Downpatrick did not allow themselves to be discouraged by the opposition, as Tumelty responded promptly with another point to close the scoring before the first water-break.The Hoops picked up where they left off as Tumelty pointed from a free after the restart, although her next effort just went the wrong side of the posts.Mulholland was in fine form as she dribbled past two opposing Kilcoo players to allow Tumelty to score a trio of unanswered points for her Downpatrick side.With  minutes gone, Kilcoo began ramping up their attacks and were nearly rewarded when Ceallach McEvoy played a lovely weighted pass over the RGU backline to allow Johnston through on goal.Showing the Downpatrick defence a clean pair of heels, Johnston seemed certain to put the ball in the back of the net. But, it was that woman Carling again who pulled off a terric save from point-blank range to a keep daylight between the sides.Mulholland pointed from a free at the other end of the pitch before Kilcoorsquos Kane replied with the same to keep her team present in the contest.The halftime whistle sounded to leave the scores - to - in favour of Downpatrick.It was very much a game of two halves as the teams ed to the pitch after the interval with Kilcoo immediately winning the throw-in before setting off on the charge downfield.Kane kicked over a point from range before Johnston secured another for the black and white outfit.A couple of wides occurred for both sides within the next few minutes, although the weather did take a turn for the worse, with rainfall and windy conditions beginning to increase.Kilcoo continued their onslaught with a Morgan point from open play, as Downpatrickrsquos Flynn saw her effort drt narrowly off the mark. But theMagpies continued their pressure and were soon awarded with a free  metres from goal.Dearbhla McGreevyrsquos effort ped just under the crossbar and was now causing all sorts of bother for Downpatrickrsquos Carling.The Hoopsrsquo number one watched the shot all of the way but could only slap the ball into the path of the onrushing Ceallach McEvoy, who bundled it over the line in the last piece of action before the second water-break.A terric  minutes for the Magpies meant that there was just a single goal separating the sides in the last quarter with the score - to - in favour of the Hoops.There was now a tense atmosphere both from the players on the pitch and the surrounding supporters, who had turned out to watch the final.Downpatrick goalscorer Murphy kicked over a point to finally get her side off the mark in the second half, although this was promptly answered with a fine solo point from the ever-present Johnston.As the clock ticked down, the tie was still very much in the balance when Tumelty registered another point to add to her impressive personal tally.With one last throw of the dice, Kilcoo charged down the pitch but was met with a plethora of green and white shirts who forced Kane to shoot from distance and settle for the point.That signalled the last score of the game as the final whistle was blown to cue pandemonium from the Downpatrick outfit and their management team.After the match, Downpatrick joint senior ladiesrsquo manager J R Loudon reflected on his sidersquos performance and season as a whole.ldquoItrsquos unbelievable, we took these girls way back in February and this was their end goal, he said. ldquoTheyrsquore a great bunch and we have a  of around  to  players.

This is just one of a number of similar incidents against council staff which have taken place in the area over the past few months.It is believed the people responsible for the recent attacks are members of a teen gang that has been running havoc in the village since before the summer.The same gang has been blamed for the brutal killing of a cat, which was burnt alive in the village last month. Its burnt carcass was left on display with a beer can between its paws and a cigarette in its mouth.One local resident recently claimed that people in the village are living in fear of the gang that continues to vandalise and destroy property in the village.

Today, the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee is due to endorse a plannersrsquo recommendation to give permission for four new homes to be built on a quarter acre sloping site it owns at one of Killyleaghrsquos biggest housing developments.Council officials have earmarked a strip of open space land in front of homes at Grove Gardens at the Kerry estate located off the Downpatrick Road for the new homes.Ten letters and one petition objecting to the proposal were submitted to planners with the scheme part of the local authorityrsquos plan to sell off surplus land and buildings it owns across the district to generate cash.While the council does not build homes, residents opposed to its plan believe that the local authority is seeking planning approval which will signicantly increase the value of the land which it can then sell to the highest bidder.The plannersrsquo recommendation to grant outline permission for the land at Grove Gardens has angered residents and Rowallane councillor Billy Walker.It was confirmed earlier this year that none of the statutory agencies consulted about the proposal had objections, with the local authority pointing to the need for additional social housing in Killyleagh and a lack of available land to build new homes .In addition, the council contends that redeveloping the small portion of land at Grove Gardens would have ldquominimal impact on existing open space land and that the housing proposal will improve the estate physically and the attractiveness of Grove Gardens, ldquoproviding a quality and sustainable residential environment, better parking provision, a new vehicle turning area, additional footpaths and wider roadway.However, itrsquos a view not shared by residents or Cllr Walker who lives in nearby Grove Park.He said while arguments not to develop the land have failed, he is encouraging residents to object to any subsequent planning applications for full permission which will inevitably be forthcoming.ldquoThe case has been made by residents and myself that this piece of ground is simply not suitable for four homes, but planners disagree with us which is disappointing, he continued. ldquoWhile opposed to this proposal, I remain a passionate supporter of social housing and have worked alongside others to provide much-needed new accommodation and identy potential development sites.ldquoWhat we are talking about here is a proposal to make Newry, Mourne and Down Council a quick buck. This particular area of land is not suitable for social housing. I have no doubt thatan application to build private homes at this part of Killyleagh it would be refused.The Rowallane politician said while social housing provision is ldquoabsolutely critical given recent news that there are , people across the district looking for homes, the Grove Gardens site is inappropriate.He said that several years ago, along with Strangford MP Jim Shannon, the pair were able to persuade roads officials to widen the road in front of existing homes at Grove Gardens to ensure emergency vehicles could gain access.Cllr Walker said while the local authorityrsquos outline planning application will be rubber-stamped later today, there is still some way to go before builders can move on site. He added: ldquoExisting homes at Grove Gardens would overlook the planned four semi-detached properties and I believe there is an issue in relation to peoplersquos privacy. Clearly, the planners donrsquot agree with me.ldquoI remain perplexed that planners view a piece of sloping ground as suitable for new housing. It is not in my opinion and, along with residents, I do not support to this proposal. There are more appropriate sites in my opinion..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/portaferry(1).jpg","title":"Preservation order could help save trees  ","story":"A PRESERVATION order from the Department of Infrastructure may save trees earmarked for removal to build a new car and coach car park at the Exploris aquarium in Portaferry. A local campaign group mdash Portaferry Stop The Chop mdash applied for a tree preservation orderafter Ards and North Down Council rejected their alternative plans which would have reduced the number of planned parking spaces by nine, but saved most of the mature trees.The Department for Infrastructure confirmed this week that it is considering whether or not to make a TPO to protect trees, with a spokesman confirming that before deciding the matter, the Department must first consult with the local authority.ldquoFollowing formal consultation, the Department is now awaiting the views of council, the spokesman added.The matter will be discussed at the full council meeting next Wednesday with the organisation planning to invest pound, to clear the Portaferry site in order to create a new car and coach car park, new toilets, paths and lighting improvements in the Ropewalk area.The project aims to provide improved facilities for visitors to Exploris and the village and is viewed as a much-needed improvement in the wake of the planned poundm aquarium at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast. This proposal will mean that Exploris will no longer be the only aquarium in Northern Ireland.The new car-park, which has received funding from the Department for Infrastructure, should have been completed by November, but the council succeeded in getting an extension to the funding until January. However, Cathie McKimm from the campaign group, claimed that the council had wrongly given itself approval to remove the trees.ldquoThe council had not done environmental screening in its plans, which they are now doing and gave themselves unlawful permission to chop down the trees, she explained.ldquoWhen we wrote to the DfI, the planning headquarters wrote back to say that under the new legislation introduced in  when responsibility for planning transferred to councils, Ards and North Down was not allowed to give itself permission to chop down trees on land that it owned in a conversation area.She said that the council applied on September  to remove the trees which was followed up by the campaigners applying for the TPO.ldquoAll we know is that the trees are not saved yet, the original proposal is still on the table, said Ms McKimm.ldquoI have no confidence in this council to listen to what the community wants. Nearly , people signed a petition against this proposal and we reckon  per cent of those are from the Ards and North Down Council area.The group held a free concert, headlined by musician Colum Sands, at Portaferry Community Centre last Sunday in order to raise more public awareness of their concerns for the trees.Last year, the Co Down songwriterrsquos story-poem about the award-winning Invisible Tree of Rostrevor Oakwood, was given voice by neighbours and environmental campaigners aged from nine to  in the short film, Rhyme for Justice .Ards poet, Moyra Donaldson, wrote a poem for the  trees at Portaferry which was read out at the event, along with other poetry inspired by the local area.Lily Devlin, who started the campaign to save the tree, said that she and other campaigners in Portaferry have been ldquohumbled and inspired by the great support they have received in their campaign to save the trees, not just from local people and those from the Borough, but from all around the world.Speaking on behalf of the group she said: ldquoOver , people have now signed our petition mdash a testimony to the strength of opposition to the plans to destroy beautul trees in the heart of our historic town, for a car park, of all things.ldquoWersquove been trying as best we can to reason with the council over this absurd decision and get it to reconsider its plans but, to date, it has not taken its proposal to fell  trees for new parking off the table.A council spokeswoman confirmed that an updated report on the Portaferry Ropewalk Improvement Scheme will be brought to the full meeting next Wednesday and will include consideration of the Department for Infrastructurersquos proposals for a TPO in the area.She stressed that the council had not been aware of the need to get planning permission from the DfI for the removal of the trees until August.ldquoThis legislation had not been referenced by DfI Planning in any previous correspondence with the council about the proposed Scheme, she said. ldquoThe legislation requires the council to gain consent from DfI Planning for works carried out to any trees on land owned by the Council and within a conservation area.ldquoThis is anomalous with the Scheme of Delegation that DfI Planning has already approved for the council in relation to the decisions the Planning Committee can determine. However, having sought legal advice, the council has applied to DfI Planning for consent.The spokeswoman said that as per the councilrsquos standard procedures, the agenda for the meeting and a copy of the updated report will be available to the public on the councilrsquos website within  hours of them being made available to elected members..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Saintfield getting in bloom  ","story":"SAINTFIELD has again been recognised for its floral excellence after picking up third spot in the large village category at this yearrsquos Ulster in Bloom competition.Now in its rd year and sponsored by Translink, the transport companyrsquos Market Street base in Downpatrick came third in the bus station category.The annual awards celebrate the fantastic work of green-fingered gardening enthusiasts across the country, with the much-loved annual horticultural, environmental and community competition officially recognising the most beautul plant and floral displays across cities, towns and villages.Translink chairman, Michael Wardlow, said the company is proud of its long-standing role in Ulster in Bloom and it was great to see the competition grow each year, with  entries representing all local council areas as well as  bus and train stations entering this year.ldquoIt is heartening to see such fantastic demonstrations of community spirit in action, especially given the challenging times everyone has experienced, he continued.ldquoThese awards clearly highlight the pride so many have for their local areas.

In the absence of both John Donnan and James Simpson, Bradley Luney started in the second row and Jack Milligan came in at out half with Greg Hutley moving into midfield to cover the loss of Tagen Strydom.Shane Ball and Paddy Wright swapped positions as Adam Craig and his coaching team searched for the right formula in attack.Trinity were fresh off a demolition of UCD in the colours match and were able to choose from a full squad with Leinsterrsquos Liam Turner in midfield and highly regarded Ulster Academy prospect Harry Sheridan in the second row.Leinster senior squad regular Jack Dunne continued his rehab from injury with a place on the Trinity bench.Ballynahinch started badly with handling errors and a misfiring line-out inviting pressure.Despite some high quality scramble defence, they found themselves seven points down after a series of Trinity carries pinned them on their own line and quick hands and some good footwork took Max Faria over for a converted try.This was compounded by the loss of Milligan and prop Ben Cullen to injury.Another excellent defensive set allowed Ballynahinch time to dig in and they began to take the game to the students as the half wore on.A strong maul earned them a penalty on  minutes which Hutley knocked over from  metres to get his side on the board.Turner made a brilliant break just before half time but more superb scrambling kept the half time deficit at just four points.Ballynahinch had much the better of the opening exchanges of the second half and after going close to scoring a try, another Hutley penalty left the game delicately balanced.Turner then stamped his class on proceedings with a superb outside break on the Ballynahinch -metre line, opening up the defence for winger Marcus Kiely to score. Trinity then turned up the heat in the forwards and sealed the result with a close range try from a fine line-out move involving Dunne and Sheridan in the st minute.Thirteen points down with  minutes to go, Ballynahinch could have folded but they gamely stuck to their task and showed all their fighting spirit by attacking the Trinity line.They were rewarded with a try from Hutley on the gamersquos final play as he exploited the numerical advantage in the Trinity backline following a yellow card. He then calmly knocked over the conversion to salvage a point for his side.Despite opening with three defeats, Ballynahinch have shown improvement with each match and will be confident that they can soonto winning ways.They have a week off to regroup and rehab some injured players before the visit of table-topping Garryowen to Ballymacarn Park on October .Ballynahinch: B Cullen, T Stewart, K McCall, T Donnan, B Luney, Z McCall, O Loughead, C Irvine, C Gibson, J Milligan, A Cairns, G Hutley, R Wilson, P Wright, S Ball, J Hanlon, H Simpson, T Martin, D Souza, C McAuley, R Patterson..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"UUP selects Macauley to contest Assembly election  ","story":"THE Ulster Unionist Party has selected Jill Macauley to contest next yearrsquos South Down Assembly election.A former Newry, Mourne and Down councillor, Mrs Macauley has secured the backing of her party and received a ringing endorsement from leader Doug Beattie.Mrs Macauley mdash who is a member of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Council mdash said she is ldquodelighted to have secured her partyrsquos nomination to contest one of the five seats up for grabs.At the  Assembly election, Harold McKee was the UUP flag bearer and polled , votes, with the party confident that it can make a serious push for a seat when voters go to the polls next May.Based in Rathfriland, Mrs Macauley is one of the UUPrsquos most senior figures and having served as a councillor in two local authority areas, she now feels the time is right to ldquostep up and give the electorate of South Down a chance for change and a chance for positive and hardworking -pro-Union representation at Stormont.She described her work as a local representative as a ldquoprivilege, allowing her to meet and work with ldquosome wonderful people and great organisations within the constituency who do sterling work to support local communities and those most in need.Mrs Macauley revealed she has been working hard over recent months to grow the local UUP membership and said the optimism and resolve for a ldquomore confident and inclusive unionism has allowed her to continue working effectively with her party colleagues on a range of issues.She said these included the childrenrsquos funeral fund, transfer test, school unorm costs, disability and special educational needs improvement and period poverty.ldquoWe have a fantastic hardworking team of local councillors, working on the ground, always accessible and working for the greater good of local people, said the Assembly candidate.ldquoI want to thank my fellow councillors for the help and support they have given me thus far and encouraging me to step forward for election to the Assembly and the opportunity to lead our local team, as we strive to continue to be the strongest voice for Unionism right across South Down.Mrs Macauley said she hopes to prove that she is on their side and will be a strong voice for positive, confident Unionism.She added: ldquoFrom Katesbridge to Kilkeel and from Warrenpoint to St Johns Point, I have a bold, positive, ambitious vision for our people of South Down and am prepared to work with anyone to make that a reality.ldquoFor too long, we have been trapped in a perpetual cycle of fear and ision, resulting in every election becoming a constitutional show of strength rather than a mandate for socio-economic change.

But Ulster-Scots is a dialect, not a separate languageTactically, Unionism can outflank Sinn Fein by fully embracing such an act. On first reading of the previous sentence, it might seem that someone like myself, who comes from an evangelical Presbyterian, Ulster Unionist, and loyal order family background, has jumped ship to Naomi Long’s Alliance Party rollercoaster. However, Unionism needs to fully understand the new long war of republicanism in its bid to achieve a -county, all-Ireland, democratic socialist republic as demanded by the  Easter Rising Proclamation. Mainstream republicanism is no longer indulging in a violent terrorist campaign, but since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in , it is attempting to implement a cultural dismantling of Unionism.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...First, it was the parades disputes under the excuse that nationalists now lived along the routes of traditional loyal order marches. This plan was intended to drive a wedge between the Unionist middle class and the loyal orders. The culture-dismantling campaign was increased with targeting of traditional Eleventh Night loyalist bonfire locations.But the real push against pro-Unionist culture in Northern Ireland has been republicanism’s blatant hijacking of the Irish language. Instead of attempting to retake or reclaim the Irish language from republicanism, Unionism attempted to enter the language battle by trying to develop Ulster-Scots as a minority European language. However, for people like myself who grew up in rural County Antrim, Ulster-Scots is nothing more than a broad Ballymena accent!At best, in my honest opinion, it is nothing more than a dialect, but not a separate language. No doubt, Ulster-Scots ‘linguists’ will be jumping down my throat at that suggestion. It is equally abundantly clear that Unionism has been wrong-footed by republicanism over the Irish language, thereby convincing Unionism to ignore its rich heritage with that language. Republicanism has already conveniently airbrushed out of history that it was radical Presbyterians who organised the United Irishmen’s rebellion of .Likewise, Unionism seems to have equally conveniently overlooked the very signicant fact that it was Irish Presbyterians who saved the Irish language from total extinction. It is rather amazing, too, that the Orange Order’s ruling body, the Grand Lodge of Ireland, has expressed opposition to an Irish Language Act when some Loyal Order banners proudly display the Irish language. Given this rich Irish language heritage in the Loyal Orders and Unionism, how should they all react to a proposed Irish Language Act, evenSinn Fein has made it one of republicanism’s red lines The solution is simple, yet practical. The Loyal Orders and Unionism should forget about trying to combat Sinn Fein with rebranding a ‘Ballymena accent’as an alternative language.The Loyal Orders and Unionism should embrace the Irish language and apply for every penny of funding available to set up Irish language classes. The only reason Sinn Fein has made such a fuss of the Irish language is because it taunts Unionism. Sinn Fein would drop demands for an Irish Language Act like a hot potatoevery Orange lodge, Royal Black preceptory and Apprentice Boys club applied for funding to launch Irish language classes in their halls. By adopting the Irish language, Unionism and the Loyal Orders would defuse the Sinn Fein cultural cannon. Unionism and the Loyal Orders have played smart when it comes to St Patrick’s Day and the Battle of the Somme commemorations. St Patrick’s Day in the past was perceived to be a nationalist festival, but Orange lodges have also used it as a parade and many Unionist branches organise Irish stew social evenings. Likewise, both Unionism and the Loyal Orders have publicly acknowledged the role played by British regiments recruited overwhelmingly from Ireland’s nationalist community at the Somme, especially during the July st  opening day. In Orangeism, st July has become known as ‘The Mini Twelfth’, and Unionists need to break the mindset that only the th Ulster Division suffered terrible losses that day. Perhaps the pro-Union community could also make a start in recognising the role of Protestant nationalists in Irish history and heritage. – Dr John Coulter has been a journalist in Northern Ireland since , including for the News LetterMore News Letter letters and opinion at this link——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

An initial legal opinion indicates the call in has merit. As a result of this the illuminate will not be proceeding.”Sinn Fein’s group leader on the council Ciaran Beattie claimed the move to illuminate City Hall – a proposal not included in the council’s Decade of Centenary’s programme agreed by all parties– was “entirely political and triumphalist”.Mr Beattie said: “To proceed with the decision to illuminate Belfast City Hall without due process and recognition of the Decade of Centenaries principles will cause hurt in the City and disregard previously agreed council policy on remembering historical events.”DUP councillor Brian Kingston said: “We have had a number of events commemorating the centenary of Northern Ireland, some of which Sinn Fein have taken part in so it really is just petty they have blocked this.”In relation to the blocking of Stormont’s illumination for the NI Centenary, an Assembly spokesperson said: “The Northern Ireland Assembly Commission has a special lighting policy in place which deals with extraordinary requests for lighting Parliament Buildings.“All requests under this policy are agreed by consensus by members of the Assembly Commission. On this occasion, there was no consensus to approve lighting Parliament Buildings on October .”TUV leader Jim Allister commented: “Having blocked the erection of a stone and the planting of a rose bush to mark the centenary of the formation of the state they jointly govern Sinn Fein have now blocked even the lighting of Stormont for a single night.“This is but a small snapshot of the oppression which would await unioniststhey were ever so foolish as to agree to all-Ireland.“The shameful fact that Republicans have been able to abuse their position at Stormont to block this modest way to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland will only feed the growing realisation in unionism that Stormont doesn’t deliver for them.“How ironic that those who shout loudest about the need for equality and respect show so little respect to the unionists of Northern Ireland that they couldn’t even put the lights on at Stormont.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These burrows were once part of a huge dune system that stretched all the way from the River Ogmore to the Gower peninsula and this area along with Kenfig is classed as a Site of Special Scientic Interest.With the dogs racing ahead enjoying their adventure and freedom, the narrow sandy paths adorned in places by the pretty Michaelmas-daisy led them through the burrows before turning southwards towards the coast.Reaching Kenfig Sands where the tide was on the ebb there were fantastic views south westwards towards Jersey Marine, Swansea Bay, Mumbles and Gower beyond as they settled down utilising washed up tree trunks as seating for morning refreshments in warm sunshine with a welcome breeze.Returning onto the coast path above the beach the group made their way eastwards to reach Sker Point with its fantastic long-distance views back across Kenfig Sands, spoiled only by the industrial smoke and buildings of Port Talbot Steelworks.Following the coastline soon the yellow painted Sker House came into view which signalled their lunch stop overlooking Sker Rocks which was the setting on April , , when the Samtampa a former Liberty ship was making its way up the Bristol Channel towards Newport in a south westerly gale. Developing an engine fault, the captain dropped anchor so repairs could begin, but the weather worsened to hurricane force winds, the ship slipped its anchor and was driven onto Sker Rocks. Mumbles leboat was launched to try to save the crew, but the Samtampa began to break up and all  of its crew drowned, along with the eight volunteer crew members of the Mumbles leboat which was later found upside down and smashed to pieces.     Continuing along the coast path with views across Rest Bay to Locks Common in Porthcawl and reaching the western perimeter of the Royal Porthcawl Golf Club, they ventured inland following a narrow path between fences, with a field of beautul Welsh Black cattle as the heat rose, before an open field brought them through a gate into Nottage.A short journey along the busy and fast-moving West Road brought them to a rough track opposite Parc Newydd Farm, which led them to overlook the impressive, imposing and dramatic Grade One listed Sker House, which was originally founded by the Cistercian monks of Neath as one of five farms or granges to support Neath Abbey. The house was remodelled by the Turberville family in the mid-th century after which it was tenanted and then sold to the Williams family in the late th century.This was when the romantic, heart rendering story of the lsquoMaid of Skerrsquo began involving Elizabeth Williams, an attractive young lady who loved to dance in the old Town Hall above the Prince of Wales Inn at Kenfig, where the music was supplied by a harpist.One evening the harpist was Thomas Evans and upon meeting they were smitten and fell in love. For a while he courted her, but her father was against the union as he felt being the daughter of a successful landowner and farmer, Thomas Evans was beneath her as he was a mere carpenter and so he imprisoned her in Sker House.The couple tried to elope, but their plans were thwarted and until Elizabeth agreed to marry her fatherrsquos choice of husband - Thomas Kirkwood of Neath - she was not freed. They married and had four children settling in Briton Ferry, but it was an unhappy liaison andher true love was playing in the area, Elizabeth would sneak out to hear him play. She died in , it is said of a broken heart, and was buried at Llansamlet, but her unfulfilled and unhappy ghost is said to still walk at Sker.Following a track and crossing part of the Pyle and Kenfig golf course brought them back to their start point after what had been a delightful scenic and interesting tramp through history in stunning weather for the month of October.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We have had great success with online bridge during the pandemic, but now we have reopened for Face-to-Face bridge our numbers are too small to be viable.Please come and support this historic club. However, letrsquos be positive. We are exploring merging our Tuesday and Friday evening sessions with another club.And,all fails, we will resume online bridge. Penarth Bridge Club will live on!So, here is a recent hand played at a Face-to-Face session where careful judgment by both declarer and the defence were required to achieve the optimum result.The AuctionNorth had seven spades and just seven points, ideal for a pre-emptive opening of three spades. The aim of pre-emptive bids is to put a spanner in the wheel of the defence.However, the danger always is that, as here, your partner has a good hand and so has a dficult decision to make on whether to pass or bid on for game. After some thought, South could see at least six spade tricks, evenhis partner did not have the king of spades.There were also two certain heart tricks, and it ought to be possible to rustle up a trick in diamonds and one more from Northrsquos hand. So, South bid four spades.The playTrick  ndash East was on lead and did not fancy a diamond or a club. And the jack of hearts lead was fraught with danger. So, interestingly, East chose to lead the five of spades, reasoning that his king was safe for a trickNorth held the ace.     And evenSouth held three spades to the ace, North must surely have an entry somewhere to take the spade finesse. Anyway, declarer paused to consider the hand.Without the trump lead the contract would have been secure as he could have ruffed a losing club in dummy. But now things were dficult.North decided to play the ace of spades, hoping to drop a singleton king in Westrsquos hand. But no luck. Tricks  and  ndash Declarer then played a club to his ace, followed by a small club from hand, the trick being won by Eastrsquos king.East was now quite pleased he had decided to lead a trump at the first trick. Trick  - East won the next trick with the king of spades, preventing declarer from ruffing his losing club.Trick  ndash East then led his ace of diamonds, which was ruffed by declarer in hand. Trick  ndash Declarer drew Eastrsquos last trump with his queen, discarding a heart from dummy. But he could now see he still had a losing club and a losing heart, one down, having already lost two tricks.But could there be a squeeze on  Tricks , ,  and  ndash Declarer then rattled off his last four spades, forcing four discards from both East and West. East could see that dummy had to discard before West, so he jettisoned his remaining four diamonds, keeping the jack of clubs and two hearts.Declarer decided to discard one more heart and the rest of dummyrsquos diamonds. West had to hope his partner East held the jack of clubs, otherwise he was genuinely squeezed. So, he discarded the rest of his clubs, keeping his three hearts to the queen.Declarer then played a small heart to dummyrsquos ace. He followed this with the king of hearts. Bad luck, Eastrsquos jack dropped but not Westrsquos queen. Trick  - West then won the last trick with his queen of hearts, declarer only making nine tricks - six spades, two hearts, and one club, one down for a loss of  points.Four spades was a perfectly reasonable bid by South. But well done by the defence for the opening lead and care in their discards.What have we learnt . areful judgement is needed when responding to partnerrsquos opening pre-emptive bid, particularly when non vulnerable, since the pre-emptive bid is likely to be quite weak.. Sometimes it can quite be safe to lead a trump from three to king, as here.Penarth club resultsFriday  October: . Joy Seculer and Mike Downey. Peter Craig and Sean Macdougall.

NormandierCouncillor Neil Thomas, a former governor at Evenlode, said: ldquoOne problem was the transition from Bute Cottage to Evenlode, because Bute Cottage was using dferent reading and numeracy schemes from Evenlode. It was a source of irritation for the reception teachers that they had to basically reteach the children to fit into the new schemes.ldquoThis change should improve that situation, because yoursquore not going to get that conflict of schemes.ldquoTherersquos a lot of misinformation going around, and therersquos a lot on social media saying that the Bute Cottage site is going to be closed and developed, and the open area next to it is going to become a building site. None of which is referred to in this report and all of which has been denied.ldquoTheyrsquore alleging that there are plans to move Bute Cottage physically and rebuild it on the grounds of Evenlodemdashagain that is something expressly ruled out. But thatrsquos something being put out on social media, and Irsquom wonderingthatrsquos for political reasons to stir up anxiety and worry among the community. There are no such plans in place.As part of the public consultation, a cabinet report was published describing the merger plans in detail. According to Cllr Gordon Kemp, chair of the scrutiny committee, some of the concerns could be caused by people not reading that -page report in full.He said: ldquoI think part of the problem with the original cabinet report was the reference that they would remain in the same buildings was tucked away in the report. It wasnrsquot there right at the beginning, and perhaps some people donrsquot read as far as they should, unfortunately.However, the cabinet report, towards the end, discussed how the council would indeed consider relocating the nursery. It said: ldquoShould the proposals be approved, the council would prioritise relocating nursery provision at Evenlode Primary School onto a single site.The report added the council would first assess the feasibility of the relocation, and would then also consult the public before any changes.Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education and regeneration, denied there were any plans to relocate the nursery. But she added the council would ldquoprobably exploreit were possible.She said: ldquoThere are no plans to change the sites of either the nursery schools. There is a small section in the consultation document that says that there would be feasibility work undertaken to see whether or not there should be a move over to the Evenlode site. Itrsquos one of those things where yoursquore damnedyou do and damnedyou donrsquot.ldquoIf we hadnrsquot put anything in and somebody had said lsquowhat are you going to do about moving to one sitersquo, we would say wersquoll probably do some feasibility work on it to see whether or not itrsquos an option. Butwe put it in, then itrsquos a done deal. Itrsquos not a done deal.ldquoI really donrsquot know how you could build a separate nursery on the Evenlode site, but thatrsquos my personal view. Butthat feasibility work proved that it were possible, then you would have to go right the way back to another consultation. This is purely about amalgamating management and governance s within the schools.The consultation runs until November  and details of the plans can be found on the councilrsquos website. If approved, the mergers would take effect from September . The two nurseries are currently some of the last remaining standalone nurseries across the Vale. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I had nothing to anchor my le against ndash I was just drting.ldquoI didnrsquot know what I was pushing so hard for or why.

Despite having a panic attack so severe she thought it was a heart attack and calling an ambulance she didnrsquot ask for help.By , at the age of , she hit ldquorock bottom ndash she was emotionally numb, she couldnrsquot be bothered to shower or get dressed.ldquoI didnrsquot really know what I wanted from le, so had no compass, said Ms Hall.ldquoI wasnrsquot taking enough time to look after myself and got caught up in the pressures of work to the extent that they became all consuming.     Ms Hall is in a better place mentally now and is a self-development coach and speaker. Two years after her breakdown, she set up her own business, ran the London Marathon to raise money for the charity Mind and she is a volunteer director for Mind Cymru.She also started writing as a cathartic exercise but, upon realising she could help others, decided to write a book: Making Sense of Me: Nothing Changes Until I Change - A Guide to a Resilient Le at Home and at Work.ldquoThe book is a combination of my personal story and insights from neuroscience to help people cope with, manage and bounce back from burnout, said Ms Hall.ldquoI still have my ups and downs, like anyone , but I feel like I am the one in charge of me. I still get tired and fed up, but the dference now is that I know when Irsquom reaching the tipping point between wellness and illness.ldquoI know when I need to stop and restore my energy levels. I have learnt that health and self-care come first. Without that nothing  happens anyway.Ms Hall now takes time to be mindful and enjoy time with her daughters. She values her loved ones more than ever before and ndash although shersquos still passionate about her work ndash knows ldquowhen it has to come second.OTHER NEWS:ldquoI donrsquot derive my sense of achievement and wellbeing from others anymore ndash I get that from me, said Ms Hall.ldquoI hope people who read my book know that it is okay not to be okay whoever you are and whatever your circumstances.ldquoDonrsquot let pride or fear of failure prevent you from taking action to help yourself. You need to understand who you are before you can change anything my book talks about awareness, acceptance, and action.ldquoIf you understand yourself ndash who you are and why you respond to le the way you do ndash then you can choose to change and respond dferentlyyou want to.ldquoI had the choice to stay where I was or get better: I chose to get better.ldquoThank you to anyone who reads the book.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
