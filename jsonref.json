April. The Government was criticised for the Randox deal after it came to light that Tory MP Owen Paterson receives a six-figure salary from the firm to act as a consultant.Randox\u0027s tests can

US.But nearly 30,000 of the swabs had to be discarded because they took to long to arrive.Samples have to be tested within 72 hours of the test being taken, which means that any delay in their processing could leave people with symptoms unsure if they have the virus. In a statement, Randox said: \u0027As an immediate precautionary measure we have temporarily suspended distribution of home sample collection kits using one particular batchsupplier of swabs. \u0027This is a temporary measure and does not apply to our private business which uses a different supplier of

and what could happen to jobs and house prices.\u0027Pablo Shah, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, added: \u0027Consumer credit dried up in the second quarter, with lenders\u0027 assessments of unsecured credit availability falling to their weakest ever level.\u0027With unemployment projected to spike as the furlough scheme is wound down, default rates are also expected to rise, suggesting we could be approaching a credit crunch towards the end of the year.\u0027The proportion of consumers defaulting on their loans, or becoming unable to pay back the debt, was already on the rise in the three months to May.And earlier this week, Treasury body, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), warned as many as 1.9m of the UK\u0027s 9.4m furloughed workers may not get their jobs back, raising the prospect of even more defaults.The gloomy outlook has deterred banks from handing out loans, as they attempt to bolster their own books in the face of the economic downturn.The picture was mirrored across corporate loans, where default rates are also rising.The OBR has predicted that 40 per cent of small companies who have taken emergency taxpayer-backed loans under the Government\u0027s Bounce Back scheme could end up defaulting.The default rate for other schemes, such as the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, is likely to be lower.But they will still leave banks with a chunk of bad debt sitting on their books.A report from lobby group The City UK and accountant EY has suggested the Government set up a UK Recovery Corporation to help prevent toxic debt from holding back the country\u0027s economic recovery.Businesses which took emergency loans, but become unable to pay them back, could apply to be part of the corporation, the report said.Depending on their size and prospects, they could then either repay the loan more slowly as a tax on their profits, or have the government-backed debt converted into special financial instruments such as preference shares. Fast-growing businesses, meanwhile, could take investment from a scaled-up national growth fund.The City UK, which has been consulting on its proposals with the Treasury and the Bank of England, thinks that 3m jobs could be lost as a result of unsustainable business debt if no steps are taken.

By now it’s likely you’ve been out to visit a park or garden space with your family and friends. And, as the UK continues to reopen the doors and gates of its National Trust properties and other spaces to visitors, you may assume it’s easier to control crowds and distancing when you have plenty of room and it’s all outdoors.But there are myriad challenges for these venues – from “pinch points” on the grounds of stately homes, to animal interaction at wildlife parks.For visitors, checking that places and areas are safe to visit before embarking on a trip (visitbritainknow-before-you-go) is a must-do. While introducing measures and restrictions such as ticketed entry, limited visitor numbers, relocating gift shopsto larger rooms and increasing the sanitisation around the venue in areas such as toilets and food outlets has been key for managers at properties across the UK.‘The approach is to inform before arrival as much as possible’Andrew BruceWootton, CEO, Atholl EstatesReopening an estate with gardens may seem an easier prospect than, say, an indoor venue, but there was still plenty to consider for Atholl Estates chief executive Andrew BruceWootton and his team at Blair Castle and Gardens. Measures have included relocating the shop and a highly increased sanitising regime.“The approach is to inform before arrival as much as possible different people will be in different circumstances,” he says. “Because we are a large venue, people will often want to sit down, so we’ll be cleaning benches every couple of hours, but if people want to bring disinfectant with them, then please do.“It’s about trying to keep the venue as normal as possible, and clear and unfettered, so you’re not arriving to a hall of mirrors and every turn you come to you’re confronted with another sign.”As the grounds cover a rather large area, with a 3.5-hectare walled garden, arboretum, open areas of grasslands and a deer park, BruceWootton says the attraction can accommodate a large number of visitors safely under the new guidelines. “We’ve moved our shop to the ballroom, again looking at how we can make the visitor experience as relaxed as possible given that shops are by nature rather confined spaces,” he adds.‘The wellbeing the garden gives is really important’Stuart Stanbridge, chief visitor experience officer, Erddig – National TrustIn Wales, the 18th-century house and gardens of Erddig have opened with pre-booking at a reduced capacity to control numbers.“What we were looking forward to and what I think has been proved is the fact that we’ve been able to really enjoy the space. What’s so special about National Trust places in general, and Erddig in particular, is that they’re a place where people can go and escape from whatever problems they’ve got. The feedback from visitors is that they’re pleased to be back here. Because it is very peaceful and close to large populations, that outdoors space, the wellbeing that it gives, is really important.”Head gardener Glyn Smith maintained the grounds and historic plant collections, while Stanbridge helped with tree maintenance and even the venue’s shire horses and donkeys.“I’ve helped to pleach the lime trees, I’ve really enjoyed it,” says Stanbridge. “We’ve got two shire horses and donkeys – I’ve been looking after those as well. It’s been beautiful. It’s always quiet on the estate, but during lockdown there hasn’t been the traffic and pollution, so it’s been peaceful.”For ZSL Whipsnade zoo chief operating officer Owen Craft, it wasn’t just about the staff and grounds – there were some very specific large animals (and small ones, too) to think about. The park has reopened in phases, of which they are now in the second of four.“Our proposition is about authenticity and adventure, with vast open spaces and large herds of animals from elephants to rhinos, lions, tigers and bears,” he says.“We have smaller immersive up-close experiences such as a butterfly house, so it’s a nice blend. The key thing when organising this was to control the numbers when coming in. And the best way of doing that is pre-booking, only with morning and afternoon slots to stagger flow.”But some areas of the zoo remain closed off. For humans to go near the primates, for instance, visitors would need PPE because primates are more susceptible to Covid-19 transmission.“On arrival and in and around the site, we’ve got 2-metre pawprints everywhere,” says Craft. “The queueing system starts from the car park. Anywhere you funnel into a smaller viewing area we have to control queues, so we have pawprints for those as well.”Each of the zoo’s first two phases of reopening was in line with UK government adviceand the next two stages will be as well. “Phase three is about indoor play,” adds Craft. “Certain experiences we’d look to bring back as well as looking at how we can do an indoor restaurant offering. Phase four is about our overnight accommodation lodges, they’re seasonal and not open at the minute. We have nine glamping pods up on the downs and we run that from March to October ... so we will reconvene those in 2021. But the core day-visitor experience is open and running.”Again, it’s about the wellbeing element of what the venue offers, he says. “As we’re easing out of lockdown, people want that connection with nature – and I think Whipsnade being reopened is not to be underestimated, really.”‘People have come back to a wilderness and they’re loving it’ Tammi Peek, partnerships manager, Mount Stewart – National TrustWith large manicured gardens and its own lake, Mount Stewart is a neoclassical home and National Trust property in County Down, Northern Ireland.For partnership manager Tammi Peek and the team, the focus so far has been on installing low-key signage and one-way systems, as well as setting up a pre-booking system. Above all, their aim is to ensure that people would feel safe bringing their loved ones.“The first challenge was to think through how we get people on site,” says Peek. “People tell us when and what time they’re coming. Members are free and non-members can pay online. We get a list and print that off each day and know the surname and arrival time. When they arrive, we give them a brief description of how the property is now working. And we’ve found that while at first there was frustration, because you can’t be spontaneous any more, once people arrive, they are loving the security of us knowing how many people are on site.”The venue has slowly increased daily visitors and reopened its tearoom. Being measured and cautious has helped, says Peek.“We’ve found people have respected each other’s space. On site, we’ve got one-way systems in operation, which we’ve tried to make as intuitive as possible.”The property now runs with what Peek describes as a “skeleton staff”, with 20 workers brought back from furlough, but not all on a full-time basis. “Lots of us are doing jobs we might not normally do, but our priority is get folk in,” she says. She adds that they’ve tried not to be “overly covid signposted”, but that visitors do want to know which routes around the property will help them best adhere to social distancing. And there have been some lovely surprises for return visitors, too.“They’ve come back to see a wilderness in some places and they’re loving seeing the long grass and the way the breeze goes through it and the increased numbers of butterflies.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Yet he ended up in an unmarked grave in London. Or so it has always been believed …Baking sourdough, binge-watching Normal People or Mrs America, learning origami. People have dealt with lockdown in many ways. Personally, I went looking for the bones of Hans Holbein, the German artist who died almost 500 years ago and was dumped in an unmarked grave in the City of London. Or so it has always been believed.Emptied out by coronavirus during lockdown, the City was the perfect place for socially distanced, government-mandated walks. And beneath its streets are the bodies of innumerable plague victims. One in particular haunts me. Holbein died in London, almost certainly of plague, in 1543. The long shadow of bubonic plague permeates his art, in its danse macabre of corpses and skeletons. It seemed appropriate to seek out this master of pestilence in a time of pandemic.Holbein was a Renaissance star. Born in Augsburg, southern Germany, he made a name for himself in the Swiss city of Basel before blazing his way into Britain as a guest of Thomas More, author of Utopia and chancellor to Henry VIII. Later he switched patron to Thomas Cromwell, now enjoying a place in the sun thanks to The Mirror and the Light, the last of Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall trilogy. Holbein made a small fortune painting portraits, ending up as a court artist. Henry sent him to paint Anne of Cleves, to help the monarch decide whether to make her his fourth wife. Then, at the age of 46, Holbein died in London and was buried, it seems, in an unmarked grave.Few painters have matched his eye for living people, but look harder at his work and you see startling warnings that death is ever at your shoulder. In The Ambassadors, in London’s National Gallery, two wealthy men stand in the prime of their lives, dressed in opulent furs and surrounded by symbols of science and culture, from a globe to a lute. It is all rendered in perfect, glowing detail against a sumptuous green curtain.But something cuts across the lower half of the painting and right through their covetable world: a black-and-white smear that interrupts the scene as strikingly as a pandemic. When looked at from the correct angle, the long, thin blur reveals itself to be a human skull – the inescapable presence of death.To ram the point home, Holbein created a series of woodcuts called The Dance of Death, in which the skeletal reaper interrupts people while they are in the middle of ruling, loving or ploughing. To bang in the final nail, he also painted Christ as a rotting corpse. And The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb does not even hint at resurrection – it is simply a deceased man whose face is turning grey and feet are tinged with green. When Dostoevsky saw it in Basel, he was transfixed. “Why, a man’s faith might be ruined by looking at that picture!” he has a character say in The Idiot.Having portrayed death so many times, Holbein found himself in a London struck by plague. A few weeks before he died from plague, according to his 17th-century biographer Karel van Mander, he made a will to provide for his two illegitimate children in England. The exact location of his bones is unknown, so midway through lockdown I decided to go looking back over what clues still remain.My search began at Aldgate underground station, quiet as a grave without its commuters. And it may indeed mark a mass grave: when Victorian workers were tunnelling here, it’s said they hit a wall of human bones. This was reputedly the site of the biggest burial pit during the great plague of 1665. In A Journal of the Plague Year, Daniel Defoe describes how carts dumped bodies into its “common grave of mankind”.Aldgate was where Holbein lived. He may even have drunk from the Aldgate pump, which has been a source of fresh water since the middle ages. In the early 19th century, the pump’s water started killing people. This was traced to the fact that its supply flowed under cemeteries crammed with bacteria-ridden corpses. It is another macabre detail in an area dense with reminders of urban mortality. The gate of one nearby churchyard I found, at St Olave’s, has grisly skulls carved over it. Charles Dickens nicknamed it St Ghastly Grim. There are so many skulls on churches hereabouts, actually, they started to feel like clues.Disease was rife in Holbein’s time. Average life expectancy was about 35, so he did all right to reach his 40s. To live well was to prepare for death. Jean de Dinteville, seen in The Ambassadors, wears a skull badge on his cap. Holbein showed similar acceptance as he had made his will at his Aldgate house: he wasn’t going to be surprised, like the King in The Dance of Death – interrupted as he feasts by a skeleton waiter. In this horrifying woodcut, 34 souls from all walks of life meet a grisly end.St Katharine Cree, one of the Aldgate churches with a claim on the artist, is an ancient gothic survivor, now overshadowed by the tubes and funnels of the Lloyd’s building. It made it through the great fire and the blitz and seemed a good candidate for Holbein’s resting place. But when the art-loving Earl of Arundel wanted to put up a monument to Holbein here in the 17th century, no trace of a grave could be found. The artist, it was concluded, must be in a plague pit somewhere.So people in the 17th century deduced from the very absence of a gravestone or monument that Holbein must have been one of plague’s anonymous victims. Can there be any other explanation?Perhaps he fell foul of a monster king. By 1543, Henry VIII, serial killer of wives, was not best pleased with his court artist. Sent to portray a potential fourth wife, Anne of Cleves, before Henry ever saw her, Holbein came back with such a lovely painting that Henry had musicians play to celebrate. When Anne arrived in person, he claimed to find her too ugly to sleep with. There’s no record of Holbein being punished, though. He was probably saved by the low status of artists in Tudor Britain. In Italy, they might be gods but here they were just manual workers. Holbein was underneath Henry’s radar. Doing away with him would be like having a cook killed for making a substandard pie.I found another possibility, though, under the massive girders that support Cannon Street Bridge. A piece of Britain’s past has gone missing here. In the Renaissance, this was the Steelyard, a community of German Hanseatic League merchants. Holbein made much of his money portraying them. While we treasure his pictures of the English court, his great painting of the Danzig merchant Georg Gisze, produced here, is a highlight of Berlin’s Gemäldegalerie.So here is another reason I wanted to find Holbein’s grave. The UK has left the EU and we pretend we have always been a cultural island, set in a silver sea. Holbein proves otherwise. The greatest “British” Renaissance artist was part of a lost London-German community. This may be why his grave is unknown. In Tudor Britain, foreigners were called “strangers”. Holbein’s friend More spoke out to end a murderous riot against them known as Evil May Day. Was Holbein thrown into a pit not only because he was a plague victim, but also for being a “stranger”?Holbein surely deserves a Denkmal – a place to think things over, as the German word for monument (from denken, to think) beautifully suggests. But where can you think about someone who was thrown in a mass grave? And so my family and I came to St Andrew Undershaft, Holbein’s parish church. It too survives, no longer skulking under the maypole shaft it was named after but beneath the Gherkin.Behind the church are the remnants of its old burial ground. It would be poetic if this little space in the heart of the City harboured Holbein’s grave – because it does make a pleasant spot to think. In the afternoon sunlight, something white stood out against dark soil of the small yard. It was a piece of a jaw, with holes where the teeth once were. It looked uncomfortably human. But I quickly realised, almost with relief, that it was too small. There were other bones scattered around, too. Perhaps they were part of a badly ground fertiliser pack, or relics dug up by scavenging animals. I had not found the remains of Holbein, but it did feel like a message from him. I had gone looking for one of the most assiduous painters of bones ever – and here we were, pondering bones in the plague-stopped city. Did they mark Holbein’s grave? Surely not. But they pointed me back to his art, and to what felt like a solution to this mystery.The skull, the skeletons, the dead Christ – maybe Holbein let himself be thrown in a common grave as his final artistic gesture. After all, in his will he could have left money for a funeral and tomb, as Leonardo da Vinci did in France. By not doing that, he knew he risked the common pit. If this truly was his fate, then he was boldly embracing the insight of his art. From the king to the priest, from the lawyer to the peasant, from the abbess to the artist, we all end up the same in the end: snatched out of existence like the 34 lost souls in that magnificent, haunting masterpiece, The Dance of Death."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0411308a3798d42993b5f6480640b35b93691a5/0_118_3142_1886/master/3142.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bfa01ac6baf86e149220ff6c12a569f","title":"next generation magnum photographers","story":"From crime-scene torsos to the tension of a chess game – this new wave of photographic talent set out their vision"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc95c063480b5c40bbedcf0c447138888d605110/226_380_3003_1803/master/3003.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c8db6717f4d05be83bf0e2789d631fa","title":"new horizons the living landscapes of don mccullin in pictures","story":"From the freezing Arctic and tombs ravaged by Isis to the beauty of his Somerset home, a new exhibition shows another side to the renowned war photographer Photographs: Don McCullin, courtesy of Hauser \u0026amp Wirth"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20d4bad20eb33a4ff632fdd5926e8312ae4d9bcf/0_263_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=762986c53e3d2f64173196905a545b58","title":"worlds largest oil firm joins alliance to reduce industrys carbon emissions","story":"Saudi Aramco joins Oil and Gas Climate Initiative pledge but critics say targets are insufficientThe world’s biggest oil company, Saudi Aramco, has joined an alliance of oil companies to set the first industry-wide target to help tackle the climate crisis by setting carbon emissions goals.Saudi Arabia’s state oil giant has agreed to reduce the carbon intensity of its business as part of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) which includes Shell, BP and ExxonMobil.To meet this target oil companies will need to reduce the methane emissions that leak from oil and gas projects, cut gas flaring, invest in carbon capture technology or even run their oil rigs using renewable energy.In a joint statement, the chief executives of the OGCI’s member companies said: “Together we are increasing the speed, scale, and impact of our actions to address climate change, as the world aims for net zero emissions as early as possible.”Climate experts have warned fresh “intensity targets” are no replacement for a commitment to reduce carbon emissions on an absolute basis by producing less oil and gas.The industry alliance was set up in 2014 by the chief executives of oil companies responsible for almost a third of the world’s oil production. It has angered climate campaigners in the past for “greenwashing” its activities, which are dwarfed by the scale of members’ contribution to the climate crisis.Mark Campanale, the founder and executive director of Carbon Tracker, said: “We welcome attempts to reduce emissions, for example flaring and methane leakage. But the initiative cannot, however, ignore the real and glaring issue facing its members, namely commitments for absolute reductions in emissions.”An intensity target means a company must reduce its emissions on a per-barrel basis but it does not cap the amount of oil that can be produced, so a company could still increase its contribution to the climate crisis even while meeting a carbon intensity goal.Campanale called on the OGCI to undertake “the serious accounting work necessary for writing down fossil fuel assets” and begin a “real discussion, with the clear urgency the climate crisis demands”.The OGCI’s full membership includes: BP, Chevron, China’s CNPC, Italy’s Eni, Equinor, ExxonMobil, Occidental Petroleum, Petrobras, Repsol, Saudi Aramco, Shell and Total."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4c8a0b3602e71a560c3167da7562eb4b8faa099/0_0_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9a984f4fc0d035c11ba07ae55f58d94","title":"cadbury to shrink size of wispa gold and double decker bars","story":"Decision, which also applies to Boost and Bournville Classic, will only affect multipack itemsCadbury is shrinking the size of Double Decker and Wispa Gold bars sold in multipacks so they contain less than 200 calories in an attempt to help tackle obesity, but the smaller bars will cost the same.Cadbury, owned by the US confectionery group Mondelēz International, said multipacks accounted for the biggest slice of its chocolate sales and the change would eliminate 10bn calories from the UK market in one fell swoop.The company said it was offering more portion control options by voluntarily committing to bring all Cadbury chocolate bars sold in multipacks under 200 calories by the end of 2021. The list of products being reduced in size includes Wispa Gold, Double Decker, Boost and Bournville Classic. However, there will be no change to the size of the bars sold inidually.A spokesperson for Cadbury said: “The list price for these products will not be changing at this time. Retail pricing remains at the retailer’s sole discretion.”The practice of reducing product sizes but maintaining prices effectively increases their cost per ounce and is known as “shrinkflation”.The confectionery group has already promised to reduce the serving size of treats typically bought for children to under 100 calories by the end of this year with Fudge, Curly Wurly and Chomp bars among those to have already made the switch.Louise Stigant, the UK managing director at Mondelēz International, said: “We recognise we must play our part in tackling obesity and are committed to doing so without compromising on consumer choice. A focus on portion control is recognised as one of the most effective ways of helping people balance their calorie intake.”Measures to try and nudge the public into healthier food-buying habits are among policies being considered, in what has been billed a “war against obesity”, being drawn up by Downing Street.Last week it was suggested that supermarkets in England could be stopped from placing chocolate and sweets as impulse purchases at the end of aisles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd7c1e7ccfd806112ffc3f40513b4896a1583179/0_36_4971_2983/master/4971.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0320d160d513e40d5d197346b5f4619","title":"the guardian view on julian lewis better a maverick than a poodle","story":"MPs were right to defy Downing Street by choosing the Tory rightwinger to chair the intelligence and security committee Julian Lewis and Chris Grayling are a pair of dyed-in-the-wool rightwing Conservative leaver MPs. On issues like Brexit, their politics are as indistinguishable as Tweedledum and Tweedledee. Yet Mr Lewis’s surprise victory over Mr Grayling in the election to chair parliament’s intelligence and security committee on Wednesday is not a plague-on-both-your-Tory-houses result. On the contrary, it is the sort of outcome that even parliament’s most trenchant leftwingers and remainers could scarce forbear to cheer. For Mr Lewis is a rightwing maverick, while Mr Grayling is a rightwing poodle. Mr Lewis’s win is one in the eye against No 10, the whips and the payroll vote. It should unite all those on every side of politics, and of all parties, who want MPs in parliament, not Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings, to make the decisions that matter.The committee was first set up in 1994 by a Conservative prime minister, John Major, who respected parliament. Its powers were enhanced in 2013 by another Conservative, David Cameron, who shared that respect. Over the years it has become more confident as a result. Boris Johnson, by contrast, has little respect for parliament, no desire for accountability, despises checks and balances, and is vindictive towards those who disagree with him, especially on Brexit. His attitude to the committee has been the polar opposite of respectful, not least because it was chaired, until 2019, by the independent and scrupulous former attorney general Dominic Grieve, a staunch remainer.It is a disgrace that the committee has barely met for an entire year and has only just been reconstituted. It is a disgrace that this has meant that the final report written under Mr Grieve, on Russian interference in UK politics, has gone unpublished until now. But the worst disgrace was Mr Johnson’s attempt this week to parachute Mr Grayling into the chair in an effort to stifle its valued independence and expertise as his condition for relaunching a committee that is a statutory body.Unlike almost every predecessor in the post since 1994, Mr Grayling had a contemptibly poor record as a minister. Unlike almost every predecessor, he has no background in the security world. There were plenty of better qualified candidates on the Tory benches who could have been put forward, such as Sajid Javid, Julian Smith, or indeed Theresa May. But they were all Mr Johnson’s marked enemies. The choice of Mr Grayling was shabby and shameless. The indignation that would be directed against a Labour prime minister who behaved in this manner over national security issues does not bear thinking about.Mr Lewis is now on the Downing Street enemies list too. Mr Johnson’s instant response to his election was typically spiteful, expelling Mr Lewis from the parliamentary Conservative party. This is a potentially draconian sanction. Mr Johnson and Mr Cummings did exactly the same to Mr Grieve and 20 other Tory MPs who voted against a no-deal Brexit last September, driving them out of parliament. Like them, Mr Lewis has committed the sin of being independent-minded. He also has very strong views on defence. Having him in the chair as Mr Cummings sets about trying to turn the Ministry of Defence and the secret agencies upside down could become explosive.The committee has moved quickly too, authorising the publication of the Russia report next week. A government that wishes to treat Brexit as an accomplished fact is nervous about any suggestion that Brexit is also the policy of Vladimir Putin. This explains why the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, on Thursday tried to turn the spotlight on Russia’s possible role in providing Jeremy Corbyn and his advisers with secret documents during the 2019 general election. This is a dirty political battle on all sides.Mr Johnson’s desire for strict control over Tory MPs may make him launch a whipped vote in the Commons chamber to remove Mr Lewis. This could rebound in Mr Johnson’s face, not least because it goes against the law under which the committee exists. MPs value their independence. Few of them owe Mr Grayling a favour on this scale. It would be an important test of the honour and dignity of a fresh cohort of Tory backbenchers. Bring it on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51b9cad4b6767820281c6a3ceb269278eb5d434d/0_0_3076_1868/master/3076.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18d67b7e43fb06676d122badef697224","title":"collaborations backstage films and a pop up show paris mens digital fashion week in pictures","story":"The global pandemic saw the springsummer 2021 Paris menswear shows delayed but they still went ahead, online.

Crystal Palace were game opposition who found the finest details were against them. Wilfried Zaha felt he should have had a 44th-minute penalty – the video assistant referee said no it was a tough one to call – while the technology would rule out what would have been an equaliser from Jordan Ayew for the tightest offside decision.The teams had lined up for the restart when the notification VAR was checking came through and it was one of those decisions that took an age to resolve. Ayew was shown to have been beyond Aaron Wan-Bissaka by the length of a toenail. It was the seventh goal scored against United this season that VAR has chalked off – which is a joint league high. The visitors also had cause to be grateful to David de Gea, who made a clutch of good saves.Rashford dragged United to the result that extended their unbeaten sequence in all competitions to 19 games. He changed the complexion of the game with a composed finish in first-half stoppage time and it was his pace, directness and vision that lay behind the Anthony Martial goal that clinched victory.Rashford burst past two Palace players on halfway before finding Bruno Fernandes and, when he got the ball back, he fizzed a pass into Martial for him to curl home. What happened next provided the sour note. Patrick van Aanholt had flung himself into an attempted saving challenge on Martial and he landed awkwardly on his shoulder. His screams were only too audible and, after some lengthy treatment, he was taken away on a stretcher.United had watched Leicester win earlier in the evening and knew they had to follow suit but until Rashford’s goal they were second best. Zaha fired an early warning shot at De Gea and, after Ayew had worked the United goalkeeper, Palace felt they had won a penalty. Zaha ran at Victor Lindelof and the defender did not seem to have his feet set properly Zaha’s trickery does that to opponents. Lindelof swiped for the ball and both he and Zaha went to ground.How to unpick it? The replays appeared to show Lindelof touched the ball and Zaha’s calf at almost the same time. Palace were unimpressed when the decision went against them. “Is the VAR broken – serious question?” tweeted the Palace chairman, Steve Parish.United were ahead moments later and it added up to a sucker punch for Palace. Fernandes swapped passes with Martial and then played a nice ball into Rashford and, when he slammed on the brakes and jinked the other way, he threw Van Aanholt off balance. The shooting chance was opened up and Rashford never really looked like missing.It was a moment of isolated quality from United during a first half that ended up with De Gea pushing away a Luka Milivojevic free-kick. Harry Maguire had fluffed one header from a corner and flicked another wide, while Mason Greenwood scuffed following a Martial cut-back.Zaha was a thorn in the side of his former club and he thought he had set up the equaliser early in the second half, having beaten Wan-Bissaka and flashed across goal for Ayew to turn home. Enter VAR.With Luke Shaw and Brandon Williams out injured, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had started Timothy Fosu-Mensah at left-back – it was the Dutchman’s first appearance of the season and his first in a United shirt for 1,152 days. He did nothing wrong, although the United defence was stretched, with James McCarthy working De Gea from distance on the hour.United craved the comfort of a second goal but it took some time in coming. Rashford shot too close to Vicente Guaita, while Fernandes hit the post from a Rashford cross. Then Martial’s finish killed the contest and Rashford would be denied late on by Guaita.Zaha knew it was not his or Palace’s night when he ran through only for De Gea to save with his feet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29fbe1e8ddf81ae748b68b8df055811d3152dbbf/0_206_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8db19a3b1df037a81a78c30bb1dedd4c","title":"mexico coronavirus municipalities of hope","story":"More than 300 towns free of Covid-19 were allowed to reopen in May to mitigate the pandemic’s economic cost. With cases surging, most have been forced to closeAs the coronavirus pandemic advances across Mexico, leaving thousands dead in its wake, Tepango de Rodríguez has – so far – remained untouched.The town of about 4,000 people sits high in the mountains of the Sierra Norte in Puebla state, and was quick to apply strict preventive measures, closing its food market and installing health checkpoints.“The local health councillor put in a lot of effort to remind people to stay home and use face masks,” said Ismael Domínguez Ruiz, a historian who runs a Facebook page in the town. “She was practically going door-to-door to remind people what to do.”In May, Tepango de Rodríguez was included on a list of 324 towns that the Mexican government decided were eligible to reopen early, as part of a program called “Municipalities of Hope”.The plan allowed places with no Covid-19 cases – and with no cases in surrounding areas – to start lifting restrictions, in an attempt to mitigate the shutdown’s devastating economic impact.But less than two months later, Mexico has become one of the worst-affected countries in the world, with at least 311,000 cases and 36,000 deaths. And the list of Municipalities of Hope has dwindled to a few dozen.One town – Ometepec, Guerrero, lasted less than 14 days on the list. “In just a few weeks, we went from zero to 47 confirmed cases and six dead,” said Ulíses Moreno Tavárez, who lives in the town.According to Dr Carlos Magis Rodríguez, a professor of medicine and a public health researcher at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, a lack of serious lockdown measures doomed the strategy from the beginning. “If there were strict control of entrances and exits, a quarantine upon arrival, it could have worked,” Magis Rodríguez said. “The places this has worked are practically islands.”The shutdown of the country’s capital has further complicated matters, sending thousands of potential carriers back to rural areas. Even in remote towns where residents installed their own health checkpoints, “they block entrances to block visitors with the virus – but not to residents who returned from Mexico City,” said Magis Rodríguez.Across Latin America, poor families have faced an impossible choice – between obeying quarantine measures and starving, or venturing out to work despite the danger of infection.But unlike other leaders, Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has not introduced stimulus measures to help the most vulnerable population, instead pushing through a string of severe austerity measures – even as he emphasized the need for the economy to stay open.The president, popularly known as Amlo, has also downplayed the pandemic – claiming in April that Mexico had “tamed” the virus – and repeatedly emphasized the need for the economy to stay open, striking a notably more relaxed tone than warnings from the country’s Covid-19 tsar, Hugo López-Gatell.This week, López-Gatell expressed concerns about the virus’s resurgence in areas that had reopened too quickly – only to be contradicted by the president, who insisted that “going out to the street is necessary, if we earn our living on the street”.Mexico has one of the lowest testing rates in the world, at approximately 2.5 tests per confirmed case, compared with the US rate of 12.52, the UK’s 22.57 – and New Zealand’s rate of 359.2.Officials have admitted that lack of testing contributes to an undercounting of Covid cases and deaths, even in the country’s capital.But even as they were allowed to reopen, most of the Municipalities of Hope had not applied Covid tests.Nearly all of them were small, rural towns with limited transportation and health infrastructure, but the same factors that slowed the virus’s arrival also make it difficult to identify and treat Covid-19.Even in towns with hospitals, local health infrastructures do not guarantee a speedy testing response.“Here, they only test you if you have quite intense symptoms,” said Moreno Tavárez, who in May was tested at the local health center in Ometepec after experiencing Covid symptoms.“They take the tests from here all the way to Acapulco, and they only send you results if you are positive, leaving everyone else who is tested in suspense.”After several weeks of self-treatment, Moreno Tavárez recovered fully. He assumed he hadn’t had Covid. On 30 June he finally received a positive result.The town of Juchitán was the last in the Pacific coast state of Guerrero to maintain its status as a Municipality of Hope. In late June, cases were diagnosed in neighbouring towns – but by then life in the town had returned to normal, with open stores, schools and restaurants.“People are already careless about it,” said Edgar Liborio Huerta, who works as a construction company administrator in the town of roughly 2,000. “Very few people use face masks.”No Juchitán residents have yet been diagnosed with Covid-19 – not least because patients would have to go to a hospital either in Acapulco, about three hours away, or Ometepec, a 40-minute drive away, for testing.Nonetheless, there are rumours of covid deaths. Elizabeth Liborio Magaña, a Juchitán resident, said that a relative of her husband was one of the suspected cases. “He had asthma problems and they were acting up,” she said. “He got a fever and died of respiratory failure, but they haven’t said if it was because of covid.”To ward off their own outbreak, Juchitan’s authorities continue to take preventive measures. They cancelled the town’s patron saint festivals, usually held in July and August, which tend to attract visitors from all over the region.Meanwhile, the struggle between health and solvency continues. “We have to go back slowly to normal,” said Liborio Huerta. “It’s not because the pandemic is over, but because of the economy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/144a52b7a2218ae26ef8b7a4f2b8f762bcd92aca/0_0_2517_1512/master/2517.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fe8b8535b8184abcff9e2e72a2342ed","title":"coronavirus immigration pandemic new york glasgow","story":"I was used to living in a different country from my family. But the pandemic has made us realise we might not be together for some timeI miss my mother. She lives in Glasgow, and I live in New York City. Before our respective cities got locked down, this distance was business as usual for us. With a parent from either side of the Atlantic, I’ve always had family members living in both the US and the UK. But business as usual was when borders were open. Now, like millions of other people who live in different countries from their relatives, we’re trying to cope with the knowledge that we may not see each other for years.We’ve had the privilege of seeing immigration as a force for good in our families: for opportunity, adventure, variety. But now, we’re reconsidering our choices in ways that we’ve never imagined we would.Like so many of the personal sadnesses of the pandemic, it’s hard to reflect on this without acknowledging the good fortune we have in the grand scheme of things: we’ve stayed healthy, we’re not in danger of losing our homes. Many of us who are struggling with not being able to see our families in other countries are struggling because a huge luck that we’ve long taken for granted has disappeared. When we moved, or said goodbye to our relatives as they crossed borders, we did so under the assumption that we’d always be free to travel. We know that our particular pandemic predicament is far from the worst problem. But it’s still a big problem.For people who’ve always lived near their relatives, it might seem like my family isn’t close. I have two siblings, and at one point we were all living at least 3,000 miles away from our parents. But families like ours will recognize that our inclination towards distance is a kind of closeness in itself: by going away we were being unoriginal, following in the footsteps of our parents, who themselves both were immigrants when they were young. When you grow up with people who are out of place, sometimes there’s nothing more comfortable than being somewhere you feel foreign. My siblings and I had confidence to seek adventure in far-flung destinations because we knew that our parents had flourished when they migrated – and because we knew that we could always go home.I was sad when my mother moved back to Scotland after my father died, but I understood why she chose to. I’d just returned to the US after living abroad for many years, so I could relate to feeling pulled back to the country where you were born. When my mother left, I also understood that we’d visit. She was there when my son was born 19 months ago, just as my Scottish grandmother was present for my birth in New York in the early 1980s, taking her first flight at the age of 74. When I was growing up, return visits were rarer. It was a huge, expensive undertaking to get us all across the Atlantic in that era. My parents cut corners elsewhere in our lives to make it possible: experiencing another country and culture was a gift.I was happy to believe that my son would get to experience that, too. We had it so much easier: flying was less momentous. Phone calls were no longer special treats rationed for birthdays and holidays. There was always the next visit to look forward to.Until there wasn’t. It turns out that not being able to make any plan at all is the crux of the problem. It turns out that having plans were what kept us feeling hopeful, and close, and not filled with longing and terrible thoughts about the future that can’t be said. Why, we ask on our calls, did we do this to ourselves? Of course we know that many families are separated within countries, too, but still the possibility of domestic travel seems more promising. I can picture my family driving 1,000 miles to Florida to see my father-in-law, if that’s what it takes. It’s harder to imagine a world in which it will feel safe for my mum to get on a plane, much less one where the UK is welcoming to visitors from the global leader in Covid-19 cases.We were complacent: that’s the truth. My Jewish great-grandparents, refugees who emigrated to the United States from Russia and Lithuania, didn’t have a hope of ever seeing the family members that they left behind. Their children, my American grandparents, only spoke English: what was the point of learning languages useful in places that they’d never return to? The truth is that before the pandemic there were millions of families making the same excruciating decisions as my great-grandparents. Families like mine felt sorry for them, maybe campaigned for them, or donated money to organizations to help them. But we didn’t relate: to us, immigration was about fluidity, not permanent parting.Since the lockdown began I’ve FaceTimed my mum with my son most days: the bright side of being at home means that it’s easier to find mutually agreeable times to speak than it was when I used to go to the office. Now, my son knows who Granny is: we say her name and he points to my iPhone. We talk about what he’s been learning, and we talk about the weather, and we talk about politics – which government is worse today? Which leader most stupid and careless? We talk about a future in which we’ll be together again, but we don’t really talk about dates, or seasons, or years. My mother is doing OK, under the circumstances. Under the circumstances, so are we. But we miss her."},{"url":null,"title":"the power of touch haunted a poem by dael orlandersmith","story":"‘Never been one much for skin on skin  or  never much cared for the skin I live in  but  NOW  The mind rolls back’Welcome to the ’s Power of Touch seriesI’ve never really been one for touchThenKisses for parentsChildrenThe hugs and kisses for birthdaysAndholidaysThe hug for the newly widowedThe newly parentlessI was never much of a huggerNever one connected to skinNever lived in SKIN that way(notice how I didn’t say “MY SKIN”)The skin I walked in – BrutalToughKnives in pocketsOrBootsCut-throat words as wellAndThe outpour of hard laughterWhenthose wordsHitAndIn my lean  paunchless youthThatrippled with musclesAndCold wordsOhI saw the looks – from those who wanted to reach outReach out softlyThose who ONLY wanted a glimpseMe and the people I ran with THENWe were SO well grounded in stancesThatwe KNEW were fakeButcarried on anywaybecausewe were fearful of TRULY BEING SEENWe KNEW our promises of TOGETHER FOREVERMeltedas soon as we walked away from each otherDownanother blockWe felt the heaviness of IT ALLStancesAndfistsbut were too afraidto put it downandgive into those who were strongboldin their softnessandNOWthe mind bendsandthe years flowsome of us heresome no longersome of us pass each other now as strangerslookingandno longer looking in each other’s eyesandsome of us – the fleshhas softenedandbecome loosethe stance is now a stumbleandif by chance we found – easeor fooled ourselves into thinking – it was there – That easethe easeswirled itself into a Legba dancefooled us allfilled us up with fearand kerchiefsand hidden facesandstifled breaththe fear of HANDSpossibly dirtyHandswtheir soft face caressesslaps to the palmsknuckles meeting knucklesthe intertwining fingersNowdangerous to touch.solike I said – never been one much for skin on skinornever much cared for the skin I live inI want to hold that LEAN girl – tell her to drop herHardCold stanceI want to tell her to not just glimpseButLOOKSEEandhold that strong soft personHOLDThose brave kind peopleIf I could NOWJust reach backTake them inHold them for a secondI want to reach back NOW• Dael Orlandersmith is an American actor, poet and playwright"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2aa87f5a2c4a21781cc7e1301a1dcc7832fde58/0_0_8000_4804/master/8000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbbf6185d50f191b393e6d9b72ff6af2","title":"the power of touch i held my fathers hand as he faded away it was the purest exchange of love","story":"Through months of illness, I held his sturdy, consistent and loving hands, knowing he would muster the strength until he truly could no longerWelcome to the ’s Power of Touch seriesAt some point in the 1970s, the late, great Bill Withers did a live recording of his song Grandma’s Hands. In the recording, he speaks plainly to the audience, folksy and casual, and introduces the song by saying he was raised by “just a nice old lady who used some very nice old gnarled hands to make life kinda nice for me at the time, when I really needed somebody”. He proceeds to sing one of the most beautiful songs I know, celebrating all that his grandmother’s hands, and the work they did, meant to him, and how much he misses them.The absence of the touch of all those we love is a profound loss. And so we grieve. As I, too, grieve the loss of so much of our beloved world, I think of my other griefs and the touch I miss most of all – my father’s. He passed away in May 2018, after what many called a “short illness” but in reality took an agonising three months. During those long days, I held his hand. It became a routine. I’d go into the room and tell him that “pumpkin is here!” and search underneath the hospital blankets for those big, strong hands, with long fingers that helped make him such a nimble guitarist.He didn’t always have energy for talking, but he always, always had the energy to squeeze my hand back, his skin still incredibly soft. Even weakened by illness, they still seemed like the kind of hands that could raise you, guide you, save you and keep you. Sturdy, consistent, loving.In the days before he was leaving us, I played him Grandma’s Hands. He whispered “that’s always been a great tune” and squeezed my hand. A musician by trade for all of his working days, music was often the centre of our conversations. In days when he couldn’t speak much, playing him songs that I loved, that our family loved, that he loved, was a way to pass the time, and a way to talk to one another, too. It wasn’t like the pre-hospital days, but it was something. Sometimes less than you want can mean more to you than words can say.“Most of us, at some point in our lives, have somebody that means more to us than anybody else has ever meant before or will ever mean again,” says Withers of this song. For me, that person was my father. I think of him so much, in so many different ways. But I know that the purest exchange of love I have ever felt was to lay my hand in his as he faded away, to know that he would muster the strength to clasp my hand until he truly could no longer.Withers sings the final lines: “If I get to heaven I’ll look for  grandma’s hands.”If I get to heaven, I’ll certainly look for my father’s hands. And in the meantime, perhaps the paradise on Earth we’ve all wished for for so long is the simple ability to hold, and be held again by our given or chosen families. I wish that for us all.• Lisa Lucas is executive director of the National Book Foundation"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9851440fcb409c9fab500a92687d08ffd3e653c1/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9334134efd15604bd06fc6995cb69cd1","title":"delivery and the future of dining convenience is eroding that little extra effort","story":"As Australian state borders shut against Covid-19, restaurants are better prepared than in the first lockdown. But will delivery outlive coronavirus?Less than two weeks after Scott Morrison gave states and territories the green light to loosen the one person per four-square-metre rule to two square metres, metropolitan Melbourne re-entered stage three lockdown. The city’s restaurants were able to serve dine-in customers for a little over five weeks before having to revert to takeaway and delivery only. But this time, many were ready.“If you exist on Deliveroo or Uber (Eats), you don’t exist on Providoor,” he says. “My responsibility is to get the best bang-for-buck for these restaurants. I have to look these people in my eyes – these people are my friends – I can’t take their money and not give them anything back.”Delia points out that the shift to delivering finish-at-home restaurant meals is more arduous than packing up an existing menu. It’s a pivot into product development, packaging and logistics.While Providoor provides a premium delivery service, the oft-awarded Attica in Ripponlea has become more accessible. Chef and owner Ben Shewry might deliver a weekend-only $380 tasting menu, but he first launched Attica at Home with a $60 lasagne for two with sides.“It’s definitely not above us, but it might have taken Covid to start doing it,” says Shewry. “We really like being connected to the community at a different price point and that’s been a really amazing, rewarding thing to come out of this.”Shewry is quick to counter any suggestion that delivery allows for anything more than survival. For dine-in to be financially viable, Attica must seat 50 people. Before the second lockdown, at one person per four square metres, he could fit 20 – fewer customers than there would be staff.“We’re not thriving,” he says. “This is the most trying time in our company’s history. We have to fight every day. I don’t want to understate that.”As the bulk of orders have transitioned from delivery back to dine-in, Khoo has signed on with different third-party platforms to “ersify the income” across its three outlets. The more delivery orders received, the more staff Khoo has to employ to fulfil them. Staff costs consume a significant proportion of a restaurant’s profit margin, Khoo explains, which means it only makes sense for him to use third-party delivery apps to a point.“I don’t know what would have happened if we went with Uber Eats and could have done a bigger area ... we are a small community restaurant and I just think those big companies aren’t ideal with the commission they take,” she says.Carey’s dislike of delivery goes beyond the commission rates of third-party companies to their potential to destroy the romance of the restaurant industry. Delivery can’t replicate a dining room moody with music, the swing of service or the gossip of effortless friendships and jittery first dates. But Uber Eats is not to blame – it’s simply meeting demand.“It’s not their fault,” says Carey. “Last year I thought winter was going to be good for us, considering the food, but it was quiet. Since Uber Eats, we’ve noticed a real change. The whole convenience thing is really eroding that little extra effort that people make.”Delia agrees with Carey, even though he believes that delivery is the future of food in Australia, and beyond.“If you speak to any profitable, smart person about what sector they’re forecasting growth in, it’s food delivery, and that’s a global perspective,” he says. “I’m a restaurant tragic I want nothing more than to see people back in restaurants, but the old way wasn’t working.”“It’s nowhere near enough to make it a business, but it’s giving restaurants an opportunity to create revenue now, and post-pandemic, and we are giving restaurant customers a service that they’ve never been able to access previously,” he says.Delia, who previously partnered with a delivery service when his casual Biggie Smalls restaurants were open, acknowledges that the company is a commercial enterprise that’s also fighting to make a profit.The solution in Australia, according to Delia, lies in reforms to taxation laws, specifically the abolition of fringe benefits tax and payroll tax. In major Australian cities, we’ve also become spoilt, he says – our expectations of restaurant and food quality have skyrocketed with the popularisation of eating out, but the price of food doesn’t reflect that.“Culturally we are conflicted. We want to be given a fair go where everybody has an opportunity and they’re paid properly for that opportunity, but we don’t want to pay for it, not at our expense,” says Delia. “This is a great time in our history, and I know everyone’s really down in the dumps, but if we shift our perspective, what we’ve been given is a chance to reset.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

They achieved this despite most countries in the world suffering their worst economic contractions in decades. Some 24 of the family offices in the survey managed private fortunes of more than $3bn.Josef Stadler, head of UBS’s ultra-high net worth unit, said the world’s richest people had been able to increase their fortunes during the crisis because they had enough money to “embrace and manage risk like no other investor”.“They stick to their plans, even when market volatility makes it uncomfortable. They hold their position. They are disciplined,” Stadler said. “It is missing an opportunity that gives these clients the biggest headache, not making a short-term loss.”The rising fortunes of the super-wealthy come as separate research shows that it is the poorest people in society who are mostly likely to be losing their jobs and suffering the biggest percentage fall in income.Ana Arendar, head of inequality campaigns at Oxfam, said: “Whilst those with great wealth are able to reallocate their investments to insulate themselves from the economic impacts of Covid-19, most poor people in developing and developed countries cannot take similar action to protect their limited wealth.“Wealth inequalities were already too high before the crisis and action is needed to ensure the gap does not grow further.”Family offices – which were pioneered by the Rockerfeller family in the late 19th century to preserve their wealth for future generations – are also used by wealthy people to run homes and staff across the world and to look after private jets, super-yachts and other accoutrements.The number of super-rich people continues to grow despite the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis. Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest person and the founder of Amazon, has seen his fortune swell by $75bn so far this year to a record $189bn.More than 500,000 people in the world are classed as “ultra-wealthy”, with fortunes of more than $30m (£26.5m). That means there are more ultra-wealthy people than the populations of Iceland, Malta or Belize.This week, a group of more than 80 millionaires called on governments permanently to increase taxes on them and other members of the wealthy elite to help pay for the economic recovery from the Covid-19 crisis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a4146b4dd2fb6295819f8b299edb0ca28442ad1/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b82da8a0f13e16e26a550371e83bbc50","title":"in conversation with benjamin zephaniah and george the poet pocast","story":"Benjamin Zephaniah and George the Poet are two of Britain’s most successful contemporary poets.

The report is expected to be published next Wednesday, it is understood.His comments will pitch Lewis, a long standing supporter of Brexit and the armed forces, against Boris Johnson’s advisers who wished to impose Grayling upon the committee. The committee is regularly briefed by the security services and considers some of Parliament’s most sensitive information.Lewis was expelled from the parliamentary Conservative party on Wednesday after securing the prestigious ISC chairmanship with the support of opposition members.The committee confirmed on Thursday it would publish the report into Russian interference in UK politics before the summer recess.In a statement, Lewis said the 2013 Justice and Security Act explicitly removed the right of the prime minister to choose the ISC chairman and gave it to the committee members.“It was only yesterday afternoon that I received a text asking me to confirm that I would be voting for the prime minister’s preferred candidate for the ISC chair,” he said.“I did not reply as I considered it an improper request. At no earlier stage did I give any undertaking to vote for any particular candidate,” he said.A senior government source had explained Lewis’s ejection from the party by saying he “has been told by the chief whip that it is because he worked with Labour and other opposition MPs for his own advantage”.Johnson nominated five Conservative MPs for the committee last week – giving them a majority – and Grayling was widely expected to become chair.Sources said he and the government were “surprised” by Lewis’s decision to stand.Lewis, the MP for New Forest East since 1997, has twice chaired the House of Commons’ defence select committee. He was described by the former national security adviser Peter Ricketts as someone “with much wider experience of defence and security”.In Thursday’s statement, Lewis said Johnson had no right to dictate who chairs the committee.“The 2013 Justice and Security Act explicitly removed the right of the prime minister to choose the ISC chairman and gave it to committee members. I remember this well as I served on the committee from 2010 to 2015,” he said.“There is no other Conservative MP in the House of Commons with any past experience of working on the ISC.”Lewis’s chairmanship has paved the way for the Russia report, which was sent to Downing Street in October, to finally be released.The report includes evidence from UK intelligence services concerning Russian attempts to influence the outcome of the 2016 EU referendum and 2017 general election.Following speculation the new committee chair, who was widely expected to be Grayling, could delay it further or rewrite it, a short statement from the committee said it would be released within days.A spokesperson for the ISC said: “The committee has unanimously agreed this morning that it will publish the report on Russia prepared by its predecessor before the house rises for the summer recess.”The government could seek to remove Lewis from the ISC by tabling a motion to replace him in the Commons, which MPs would have to approve.This tactic could run into trouble. Lewis has many allies on the Tory benches, including those who support increased defence spending.One senior backbench MP told the  Lewis had charm, a quality that many of Johnson’s advisers lack. “Julian Lewis knows how to work the tearoom in a way that Dominic Cummings, who has insulted most MPs at one time or another, has never quite worked out.“When he stood to become chair of the defence committee, he would produce his own handmade leaflets – including photos of himself wearing Navy uniform – and walk MPs to the voting booths with a smile and a pat on the back. People like him.”The Conservative MP Peter Bone accused Downing Street of having a “huge hissy fit” over Lewis who is “exceptionally well qualified” and will do an “excellent job”.In the Commons, Bone asked if there would be an attempt to remove the new chair.“Will the Leader of the House confirm that he will not bring forward a motion to remove (Mr Lewis) from the ISC?” Bone said.Unlike previous chairs of the committee, the former transport secretary Grayling had little experience of security matters and was dubbed “failing Grayling” for a series of policy blunders during his time in government.The former Tory cabinet minister and ex-chairman of the intelligence and security committee, Dominic Grieve, told BBC’s Newsnight: “What troubles me about this episode – quite apart from its utter absurdity, and now withdrawing the whip from Julian, who is indeed highly respected – is the mindset it gives about what on earth is going on in Downing Street.“Why did they try to manipulate this process? They shouldn’t have done.“The committee can only exist, the committee can only be respected ... if it is seen to be non-partisan and independent.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae4c4d8a833b8b7a0abaaf11930e94edf6a02676/0_181_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ef2ec84b62d568ec0a0b2b85e6e3779","title":"sunaks covid 19 package recycled up to 10bn spending ifs","story":"Chancellor’s statement ‘corrosive to public trust’ for passing old funds off as newRishi Sunak has been accused of repackaging up to £10bn of previously announced government spending to form the backbone of his summer statement plan to save jobs during the pandemic.Serving the chancellor with a blunt rebuke, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said it was “corrosive to public trust” for the government to reallocate old funds and pass them off as new money.It said at least £8bn and up to a third of the £30bn coronavirus response package announced by Sunak in his summer statement last week would be funded from underspending on previously planned projects.David Phillips, an associate director at the IFS, said: “It makes scrutiny of plans more difficult and is corrosive to trust. While governments of all stripes will, of course, want to follow the adage of ‘repetition, repetition, repetition’ when it comes to highlighting the goodies they are funding, official policy documents should also be clear about when and where spending is expected to be lower than previously planned too.”The country’s leading tax and spending thinktank said the package unveiled by the chancellor included £5.5bn in transport and infrastructure projects announced by Boris Johnson that was in fact money reallocated from other schemes.The government has been clear that the infrastructure package announced in the prime minister’s “new deal” speech was from old money, representing instead the acceleration of previously planned investments.Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS, wrote on Twitter: “All that extra money announced by govt last week not quite what it seems. The ‘Rooseveltian’ additional £5.5bn of capital spending represents an increase of precisely zero this year on budget plans. Is a reallocation from one set of projects to another.”In addition, the IFS said, the £2bn “green homes grant” announced by Sunak to help insulate Britain’s energy-inefficient homes had been allocated from previously announced spending, and the £400m for traineeships, apprenticeships, school leavers and careers advice in England was from an existing funding pot.Labour said the report was evidence that the government was doing too little to protect jobs as the British economy sinks into the deepest recession for 300 years, triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. Unemployment is expected to more than double this year, to hit the highest levels since the 1980s.Bridget Phillipson, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: “The summer statement unravels with every passing day. Money targeted to those who don’t need it, money for second homeowners rather than social housing, and now money for new pledges using money for old ones.“Passing old money off as new is no way to save jobs.”Earlier this week, the government’s tax and spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, said the chancellor’s £30bn plan to save jobs was worth about £20bn. It said this reflected the fact that many of the measures were already in its forecasts, and that it did not expect the government to pay out all of the £9.4bn earmarked for paying £1,000 bonuses to businesses bringing back furloughed staff.The IFS said the discrepancies in the chancellor’s statement emerged because the UK’s devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were in line to receive less money than would have been the case if the spending package were entirely new.It said the Scottish government would have got about about £750m via the Barnett formula – the system for allocating the share of new public spending to the devolved administrations – if the funds were new. Instead, Scotland will receive about £21m.Alison Thewliss, the Scottish National party’s Treasury spokeswoman, said the Tories had been “caught out bending the truth”, adding: “Much of the money is recycled and reallocated from previous spending, with just a fraction of new investment. When it comes to saving jobs, smoke and mirrors simply won’t cut it.” The IFS said reductions in spending in some areas and shifting the funds elsewhere was reasonable, because old projects may now be deemed less of a priority or infeasible due to Covid-19. However, it said, a lack of transparency over where spending would be lower had led to confusion over the scale of the support.Phillips said: “A lack of illumination leaves significant scope for misunderstanding and even misrepresentation of the UK government’s plans. So, can the UK government please turn on the lights?”A Treasury spokesperson said: “This suggestion is wrong. The Treasury has approved additional activity by departments as part of the plan for jobs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ab14e66357a3795ac3865e125ee87b28d063db0/0_30_1731_1040/master/1731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47f606d8ce7e9db90f5eebbf4760a727","title":"can a new music app help long term couples get their groove back","story":"Whether it’s EDM or poodle-rock, for couples who both love music the latest Spotify Premium plan can help soundtrack your relationshipThirteen years ago, our beer-goggled eyes met across a crowded dance floor in a tiny club.

I sussed out the subscription options and, since my boyfriend was also a free user, it was a no-brainer to pool our resources on Premium Duo.Exactly like the Premium subscription, the benefits of Premium Duo include ad-free music, ie no enforced shuffle or caps on skipping tracks, while each of you can listen to your own stuff simultaneously and independently – you don’t have to take it in turns.\u0026nbspSigning up is a doddle and you can invite your other half into the account via email, WhatsApp or text. You each have your own login – there’s no shared email or password – and if you’re already Premium subscribers, you can upgrade to Premium Duo and see your music, playlists and recommendations migrate to the new plan respectively.\u0026nbspSo far so easy, but what about the algorithmsplaying-together-staying-together bit? That’s where Duo Mix comes in: a combined playlist put together by Spotify, based on the music each person is listening to. So no more bickering about who’s in charge of the tunes, but a 5050 melange of your favourite bangers, ballads or whatever else tickles your collective fancy.Once registered to Premium Duo, both parties need to join (or leave) Duo Mix either via the app or at www.spotifyaccountduo. Both users will need to listen to their own stuff for a few weeks, to give the algorithm a chance to populate the new, bespoke playlist, then, hey presto, Duo Mix will be located in the Made for You section.What we learned over a couple of weeks of getting to know Premium Duo – and Premium Duo getting to know us! – is that our tastes are pretty aligned, and that there’s a world of music out there to discover and enjoy together. There’s certainly more to us than repressed Bon Jovi fandom and a litany of 90s pop hits. As two middle-aged people, we have a habit of fixating on music that shaped our mid-teens and late-20s, so we both appreciated Duo Mix suggesting contemporary acts in our mix, such as Halsey, Idles, Jake Bugg and Chvrches.We can also tweak our Duo Mix according to the vibe we’re trying to achieve. When we’re working from home, we favour silence and birdsong during weekdays. But when it comes to domestic chores, cooking and Sunday afternoons reading the papers, we can switch between Duo Mix’s Upbeat and Chill playback options, categorising tracks into jaunty or mellow.\u0026nbspSo if you’re at home with your loved one, and listening to different music in different rooms (or on headphones), it might be time to unplug and reconnect. “After silence, that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music,” said Aldous Huxley, and, safe to say, for every murmur of a baby boom after the coronavirus pandemic, there are many more couples struggling to get their mojo back. Spotify Duo Mix, then, could just be the party-for-two you’ve been waiting for, poodle-rockers optional.Spotify Premium gives you music without the interruptions.

Miniature flares have been proposed as a theoretical explanation for the so-called coronal heating problem, but until now no telescope has had a good enough resolution to observe the sun’s atmosphere in sufficient detail.The latest footage, taken at 77m kilometres (48m miles) above the solar surface between the orbits of Venus and Mercury, reveals flickering beacons, each ning just a few hundred kilometres across and lasting minutes, before fizzling out again.“The campfires are little relatives of the solar flares that we can observe from Earth, million or billion times smaller,” said David Berghmans of the Royal Observatory of Belgium, a principal investigator on the mission. “The sun might look quiet at the first glance, but when we look in detail, we can see those miniature flares everywhere we look.”The $1.3bn mission was launched in February and will ultimately provide the first glimpses of the sun’s uncharted north and south poles when the probe reaches a vantage point above the planetary plane late next year.As it moves closer to the sun, the spacecraft will be exposed to scorching temperatures, requiring its camera and other instruments to be housed behind a titanium heat shield coated in a substance called SolarBlack, made from charred animal bones. The instruments and camera peer through peepholes that shut whenever there is a risk of them overheating.The latest images show what is happening in the lower layers of the sun’s atmosphere, known as the corona, that extends millions of kilometres into outer space. The coronal temperature is more than a million degrees Celsius, orders of magnitude hotter than the surface of the sun, which is a relatively cool 5,500C. Solar physicists have been trying for decades to resolve the mystery of why the corona is quite so hot. “One of the theories is that you have all these really small solar flares going off all the time all over the sun,” said David Long of UCL’s Mullard Space Science Laboratory, a principal investigator on the mission. “What we’re seeing in these images are there are very small brightenings going off all over the sun.”It is possible that the flares could provide enough energy to heat up the corona to its observed extreme temperature. Further observations and analysis are needed to confirm whether this is the case.Solar Orbiter is now on a tour of the inner solar system on the far side of the sun, meaning it is out of everyday contact with the Earth. That will bring it into an orbit about 42m kilometres from the sun over the next two years. By 2025, its orbit will have an inclination of 17° – high enough to take images of the sun’s poles – and if the mission is extended it could reach an inclination of 33°. Mission scientists say that observations of the poles could reveal the processes driving the Sun’s 11-year cycle of activity.• This article was amended on 16 July to correct the date when the Solar Orbiter’s incline would allow it to take images of the sun’s poles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1a492d40bbfa7cbd79f24dc3ccd20d124a8f076/0_78_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16fc2f8e0e3130406cd8cc8929d5db88","title":"have you become unemployed due to coronavirus","story":"Following news that almost 650,000 people have left company payrolls since March, we would like to hear from those who have lost their jobs due to coronavirusThe number of people on company payrolls in the UK has dropped by almost 650,000 since March, as unemployment continues to soar due to the coronavirus pandemic.We would like to hear from people who have lost their jobs as a result of coronavirus over the last three months.You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

We shut down the whole ballet and went into quarantine. During those first two weeks, we still had around 10 known cases of coronavirus.” The experience clearly still haunts him, and it’s a scenario that he never wants to return to. His steps back towards live performance have been cautious.While dance in the UK remains in effective lockdown, productions in Germany and other European countries are tentatively resuming. Detrich’s dancers continued training as much as possible from their homes. In April, he got permission to consider the dancers as equivalent to professional athletes, who were permitted to train in small groups. Classes returned to the studio, but regulations stipulated nine metres’ physical distancing. A full class might be three people in a studio.Restrictions eased further, and groups were allowed to work closer, still without contact. “I began to put a programme together” – Detrich snaps his fingers – “like that”. The Response 1 programme, opening on 25 July, will be their first stage performance since March, and is designed to comply with regulations on stage, backstage and in all public areas. Determined not to overstuff the programme with solos, Detrich has included a spaced-out trio, a pas de deux (danced by a couple within the same household), and a specially adapted version of Béjart’s Bolero. Repurposing the company’s annual platform for new choreography – which had been cancelled – he also commissioned new works from eight younger company choreographers, created within and for these straitened circumstances. Three of these will be premiered at Response 1, the rest in the autumn.With just three performances and a theatre capacity reduced from 1,400 seats to 249, the programme will be hugely boosted by another repurposing manoeuvre: their free annual open-air screening, sponsored by Porsche, will shift to a newly erected drive-in movie theatre, with capacity for 1,000 cars.Very different in setup is the Parc de la Villette in Paris. A venue for local, national and international arts and culture with a strong performance strand in dance, theatre and circus, it has its own extensive grounds as well as multipurpose indoor halls designed as flexible, modular spaces with stages and seating that can be assembled and taken down – all features that make La Villette especially adaptable to evolving regulations on distancing. Even so, their entire programme – more than 30 performances – had to be either cancelled or provisionally postponed during the lockdown.Since 2 July, La Villette has now returned to life with a month-long programme called Plaine d’Artistes. Instead of presenting finished performances on stage, the entire site has been turned into a kind of open studio complex. “The principle is simple,” says artistic director Frédéric Mazelly. “We offered all our different spaces for artists to work on creation, research and rehearsal. The public can come and watch them at work for free, within timeslots and number limitations.”In total, more than 250 artists will be participating. The multidisciplinary programme includes several well-known dance names such as Angelin Preljocaj, Mourad Merzouki’s Compagnie Käfig, and Christine and the Queens’ choreographer Marion Motin. As in Stuttgart, it also gives unprecedented space to newer and emerging choreographers – 14 in total, presented through partnerships with Centre National de la Danse and Centre Pompidou.In the Czech Republic, the 32nd Tanec Praha international festival of contemporary dance has already taken place in June, though in an entirely revamped format. The festival usually encompasses a wide range of work from established companies to emerging artists, both national and international many works are also presented in regional Czech theatres. Again, the international component was cancelled or provisionally postponed.The programme then fell to local artists, once again opening more opportunities to younger or newer choreographers. To comply with distancing restrictions, founder director Yvona Kreuzmannová shifted nearly all the work outdoors, ramping up her existing partnership with Prague’s Landscape Festival. The regional programme followed a similar line: transposing work outdoors, creating events in public spaces, and only occasionally requiring indoor spaces. “In the end,” says Kreuzmannová, “we managed 16 performances in Prague and 34 outside, accompanied by about 30 workshops and aftertalks.”“We didn’t have the big venues or big names this year,” says festival co-director Markéta Perroud, “but we reached new audiences. By adapting to public spaces, we somehow got closer to ordinary life.” Both are now eager to pursue this kind of local engagement and cultivation further."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb1daf291156b43cda966e6d526e0424832c31d1/0_345_4452_2672/master/4452.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=500a707e73bba8e88ce11d699c1e2e7f","title":"democrats joe biden nervously optimistic blue wave","story":"Joe Biden is polling well ahead of Donald Trump, potentially putting more states in play – but complacency has been banishedLess than four months out from the November election, the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has been consistently polling ahead of Donald Trump.The president’s approval numbers remain underwater, and Democrats believe they can seriously compete in traditionally red states including Texas, as Trump faces sustained criticism for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the economic crisis linked to it, as well as the ongoing anti-racism protests against police brutality.For Democrats, these are not the only indicators that things are going well. Infighting between the progressive wing of the party and the establishment wing has been relatively minimal, as they come together to focus on Biden’s campaign to push Trump out of the White House.Some top party officials are feeling ambitious, and want to ride another potential “blue wave” to try to win races that are usually out of reach in states like Georgia and Ohio. But there’s a strain of caution running through the Democratic party as well. Things looked great for them for a while in 2016, too, but Republicans ended up with control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, and the memory of that cataclysmic loss is still fresh.“I mean, we are emotionally and mentally scarred in such a way that we are not going to feel comfortable until a week after Biden is sworn in,” said the Democratic strategist Tom Bowen.In any election cycle, campaign officials use cautious phrases like “we’re not leaving anything to chance” or “campaigning like we’re 10 points down until election day” – and the 2020 presidential race is no different. But coupled with that is an argument that Trump’s case for re-election is not reaching the voters he needs to.The memo went on to tick off the problems with each of Trump’s arguments.On Tuesday, in another sign that Democrats see a rare opening to compete in what are usually Republican strongholds, the Biden campaign began airing a 60-second general election ad in Texas, fueled by a six-figure ad buy. That ad is the first in a $15m multi-state blitz in six battleground states – Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Florida and Arizona.Meanwhile, the pro-Trump America First Action Super Pac is pouring $23m into Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona and Wisconsin but not Michigan – a state that Trump needs to win re-election. Trump himself has been campaigning over the last few months in reliably red states. Private polling for Republicans also shows the president in trouble in what are usually reliably conservative states.All of which suggests Democrats have the upper hand over Republicans. But Democratic state officials and operatives expect polls to tighten and the summer high to end. In multiple interviews, these officials were hopeful but also realistic that the next few months won’t be easy.Democrats often cite 2016, where polls showed Hillary Clinton as the clear favorite to win the presidency. At that time, and again now, some Democrats also felt retaking control of the Senate was possible.“I’m not going to argue that there isn’t some anxiety there, and I think that 2016 put that in our being because we were feeling very secure that we would have a Democratic president, and things changed so rapidly,” said the Kansas Democratic party chairwoman, Vicki Hiatt.Democrats are hoping to win a US Senate seat in Kansas this cycle, which would usually be unheard of. “I think over the past three and a half years we’ve seen some very unpredictable things happen that we would never have expected. I think that is where that anxiety comes from. For me personally, I’m not going to rest until we have this thing done. I’m cautiously optimistic but I’m not taking anything for granted.”From September, Biden and Trump will face each other in three televised debates, something Republican campaign officials hope the president will be able to dominate. Democrats are also expecting some kind of “October surprise” from the Trump campaign and a barrage of warnings about Democratic control of the White House and Congress.“That tightening will happen. It’s natural. So what we need to be doing is building up our reserves now,” said the Maryland Democratic party chairwoman, Yvette Lewis. “So we can’t waste time right now worrying about the what-ifs.”The Tennessee Democratic party chairwoman, Mary Mancini, said that Republicans have not yet thrown their full offensive force against Democratic candidates this cycle.“Now what they could do and what they’re trying to do is fearmonger their way into winning,” Mancini said. “I think the most damaging and frightening thing is we have yet to see the all-out assault from the Republican party in terms of using fear to motivate voters. We’ve seen a little of it but it’s the tip of the iceberg for the Republican party.”The pandemic has also changed the reality of campaigning for office. More voters will be voting by mail rather than in person, potentially delaying the final results on election night. Trump has argued, contrary to established evidence, that voting by mail is vulnerable to fraud.“I think my greatest fear is what the Republicans do now and over the next few months to delegitimise the election,” said Aryeh Alex, the executive director of the Ohio Democrats’ state house campaign arm.Julian Mulvey, a veteran Democratic ad maker, added: “Every Democrat should be worried. Every Democrat should be nervous because it won’t be over till it’s over. But I think everyone is nervously optimistic right now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f76654713773b2120f106fb658f97d1e08acb13/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=eb64d373c0e704b379c16116f68b9f59","title":"a single use face mask or one like amber heards how i learnt to choose wisely","story":"As more countries make coverings compulsory, Nazia Parveen experiences face mask envy during a work trip to MallorcaParis Hilton likes hers made from mesh, encrusted with rhinestones, Amber Heard and Johnny Depp have opted to wear bandanas for their dramatic daily court appearances. Meanwhile, for most of us it’s the disposable versions that can be bought from most high-street chemists.But whether they are bejewelled with diamante or made out of beautiful cotton fabrics, wearing or not wearing a face mask in shops has become the latest polarising debate on social media – with the reaction ranging from the humorous to downright outrage.It will be compulsory to wear a face covering in shops and supermarkets in England from 24 July, with those who fail to follow the new rules facing a fine of up to £100.During a recent work trip to Mallorca, my first foreign excursion since the world hit self-destruct, I was confronted with the prospect of wearing a mask for long periods of time. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200715-53148-gdn.pw.200715.ds.to_mask_or_not_to_mask.mp3 My choice was a Superdrug pack of 10 single-use medical masks hurriedly purchased a day earlier. My mask went on the moment I stepped into Manchester airport and, bar a few short breaks to sip a drink and hurriedly eat a sandwich, it remained on for six hours until I reached my hotel.The following day, walking through the streets of Palma, popping into shops and getting on a bus, I once again donned my three-ply, ear-looped travel buddy, as it is mandatory to wear a mask on public transport and in stores on the Spanish island.But as temperatures hit 30C the mask got sweaty and, with no escape for the warm air, nausea set in. I instantly started to regret my mask choice, jealously eyeing up those who had obviously done their research. I began to suffer from mask envy.Next came the not-so-attractive steamy sunglasses as my mask flipped about, not quite fitting the bridge of my nose. After hours of wearing the elasticated loops my ears began to chafe, an unusual, but distinct, discomfort behind my lobes.Lessons were well and truly learned, and I will be armed with research before future mask purchases, as more countries globally make it mandatory to wear them in public spaces.The Costa del Sol, where around 2.3 million Britons holiday every year, recently made it compulsory to wear masks in public at all times, in line with the other tourist hotspots of Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera. Exceptions are made only for sunbathers on beaches and pools, when eating or drinking, while practising sport and while playing a wind instrument. However, in Catalonia tourists are still required to wear masks at the beach or by the pool.Some countries and states have been recommending that everybody wears face masks in indoor settings where social distancing is difficult or impossible. They have been made mandatory on public transport or in shops in many countries.According to guidance from the World Health Organization, people over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used.The WHO says masks should be made of three layers – with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and – more importantly – because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.Across the border in France, the rules are slightly less stringent. While it is compulsory to wear face masks on public transport, it is up to inidual shop owners to ask their customers to wear face coverings. This, though, could be subject to change, with the French prime minister, Jean Castex, recently signalling that face mask use in enclosed public spaces was under consideration.Meanwhile, in Italy, although holidaymakers will not receive a fine for non-compliance, it is mandatory to use masks in enclosed public spaces. Flout it at your peril, as mask-less people will be removed from public transport.Surgical grade N95 respirators offer the highest level of protection against the virus, followed by surgical grade masks, but they are costly and reserved for healthcare workers. Then there are the homemade reusable cloth versions and the single-use paper ones.Whatever you decide on, face masks are here to stay – for a while at least – so spend the next week choosing wisely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3223620f04652188e308daee2d0ece145ec57faa/0_297_4449_2669/master/4449.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=9e9c9dc932f85ba113e4221badae8415","title":"bild zeitung tabloid julian reichelt angela merkel germany","story":"The newspaper Bild has long poured vitriol on the country’s left-wingers and ‘do gooders’. But now it has a new target: the chancellor. By  Thomas Meaney‘It would be ideal if you could hit a deer,” Julian Reichelt, editor-in-chief of Europe’s largest tabloid, Bild Zeitung, told his chauffeur. “ readers could do with a bit more colour.” We had reached escape velocity out of ice-encrusted Düsseldorf. The Mercedes S-Class locked into place like a bobsled on the Autobahn. I sat shotgun with Reichelt’s assortment of sports gear, a hockey stick between my legs. “We are lucky in our driver today,” Reichelt said, deadpan. “Last time we hit a wild boar and the boar and the car went flying.”I was travelling with Reichelt on one of his publicity tours across Germany. For the past two years, he has made an appointment once a month to commune with groups of Bild’s 1.3 million readers. “You have to feel their emotions,” he told me from the backseat. “You have to listen to their hearts.”Reichelt, who is 40, made his name as a war reporter in Syria, but today confines most of his battle courage to Twitter, where he enjoys needling the German political establishment and barging into leftwing echo chambers. In person, Reichelt exudes a twitchy exuberance, like a fighter pilot who has managed to smuggle champagne into the cockpit. His eyes restlessly gauge the world around him, clocking who he needs to avoid and who he needs to attract. Into his phone, he volleys directives to subeditors, assistants and the band of young male disciples he sends around the world to collect stories. “The leading populist in western Germany,” is how Albrecht von Lucke, editor of the prestigious left-liberal monthly Blätter, describes him.For decades, Bild was an object of scorn for any self-respecting West German of social democratic orientation. In a political culture more conformist and decorous than most of its western peers, Bild functioned like the Las Vegas strip, concentrating all of the Federal Republic’s seediness in one place. Seven days a week, Bild pumped free-market mantras, alongside ads for car tyres and chicken wings, into the stiff arteries of cold war West Germany. Bild decried long hair on men and the marriage of its top models to foreigners. It genuflected before South African apartheid, Greek dictatorship, Bavarian sedans and American Pershing missiles. Above all, Bild dedicated itself to the destruction of communist East Germany, and fought a long battle against what it viewed as enemy collaborators in the leftist student movement at home.Such was the stature of Bild in West Germany that in 1965, after the daily rose in price from 10 to 15 pfennigs, Axel Springer, who referred to Bild as his “dog on a chain”, proposed to Chancellor Ludwig Erhard that the state introduce a special 15 pfennig coin to make it easier to purchase the paper. Meanwhile, the East German Stasi was so impressed by Bild as a state propaganda tool that it crafted its own – imaginatively titled – NEUE Bild Zeitung, which was sold at the border with West Germany, where it conspicuously failed to wean class enemies off the original.Today Bild is paradoxically less influential than it was in the 60s, but more politically important. “I read it first in the morning because it is the agenda-setter,” says Josef Joffe, the publisher-editor of the liberal weekly, Die Zeit. “Politicos in Berlin probably read it first in the morning as well.” The paper enjoys a close relationship with the German political elite. The former German chancellor, Helmut Kohl, was one of the best men at the wedding of former Bild editor, Kai Diekmann, and in 2008, Diekmann performed the same role for Kohl at his wedding. “Kohl rules with Bild,” the Nobel laureate Heinrich Böll wrote, and Kohl’s successor as chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, affirmed the practice: “To govern I need Bild, Bild Sunday’s edition, and the telly,” he once said.Bild’s intimate relationship with some of Germany’s most powerful figures is a vestige of its days as the country’s decisive reputation maker-and-breaker. The former defence minister, now the president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has shown up at one of Reichelt’s dinner parties at the Bild offices in Berlin, and for the past few years Bild has hosted part of the annual Munich Security Conference, the equivalent of Davos for the global defence industry. Although Angela Merkel has not ingratiated herself with the Springer complex — despite receiving early political support from Bild — her husband is nevertheless paid €10,000 a year to grace the board of the nonprofit Friede Springer Foundation, named after Axel Springer’s widow.Despite its traditional proximity to power, Bild has mutated into something beyond a stalwart defender of the German status quo. Now, says Joffe, it is “an equal-opportunity anti-establishment force”. “Previous Bild editors made their alliances more based on personal feeling,” says the journalist Stefan Niggemeier, who in 2004 co-founded the BILDBlog, a website that corrects Bild’s factual errors and misrepresentations. “But Reichelt is different. He is an actually political person.”Reichelt’s agenda is marked less by novelty than by a chest-crunching resuscitation of Bild’s core commitments: pro-US, pro-Nato, pro-Israel, pro-austerity, pro-capital, anti-Russia, anti-China. According to the Bild worldview, the best way to counter the left is to portray its demands as totalitarian, and the best way to kill off the far right is to cannibalise its grievances. While Bild prints relatively little material that a supporter of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party would object to, Reichelt sees the party as a threat to his effort to remake the German political scene. “We want nothing to do with the imbeciles of the AfD,” he told me. “The way to destroy them is to make room for their voters in what used to be the political mainstream of this country.”Bild’s main attack targets remain Germany’s “Gutmenschen” – the do-gooders, vegetarians, Greens and 1968ers who are treated as parasites and irritants to Germany’s robust economy and middle class. More recently, the paper’s sights have also turned on Merkel and her party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). “The paper’s constant targeting of Merkel, but also its current take on refugees and all sorts of minorities definitely reproduces rhetorical elements of the AfD,” says Fatma Aydemir, a novelist and columnist for the leftwing daily Tageszeitung, known as Taz. In the absence of serious challenges from within Merkel’s own party, or from other parties – she has been chancellor for 14 years, a tenure surpassed only by Kohl and Bismarck – Bild has attempted to make itself into that opposition. Yet any populist challenger finds itself in the hard position of convincing Germans that Merkel’s very successful form of reactive politics has run out of historical steam. “We are the voice of ordinary people,” claims Reichelt. “If we didn’t exist, they would really think the whole system is against them.”We pulled into the fire station in the proud town of Sprockhövel, about 18 miles north-east of Düsseldorf, where a few dozen people greeted us, most of them in firefighter gear. Bild beer steins, Bild lighters and other Bild paraphernalia had been laid out on the firefighters’ bar. Reichelt marched out to the garage with the fire engines, where a small table stood. He took a sip of beer, and addressed the group with aplomb.“It’s an honour to be among you because, as you know, I like to meet our readers face to face,” Reichelt said. He wanted to know why they had become firefighters. “It’s that feeling that we’re brothers,” said one of the younger firefighters. “That we have each other’s back. You don’t get that feeling elsewhere.” Yes, Reichelt agreed, courage was in short supply in Germany. Courage: that was a virtue Bild could get behind.“The only trouble we have with Bild,” said another, old fireman, “is your picture contest!”Reichelt made a show of pricking up his ears. “Oh really? Is there something we’re doing wrong? I welcome your criticism!”“It encourages people to send in the most sensational photos possible, but people block the way to fires because they’re trying to take photos for Bild!”Reichelt’s face registered the gravity of the charge. He moved like a matador, coaxing anyone else with negative things to say to hurl them at his face. “Look, that’s terrible, and we’ll have to stop that. I’ll get on that immediately,” he told the man who complained about the photo contest.After Reichelt had presided over dinner in the firefighters’ hall, we got back into the Mercedes and sped into the dark. I asked him why he goes out of his way for pow-wows with his readership. “Bild is the last national campfire experience in German life,” he told me. “It’s the last thing that Germans can come together for.” It was a curious way of viewing a newspaper that has, for decades, polarised a country otherwise committed to “consensus politics” into two camps: Bild readers and Bild haters. Yet Reichelt delivered this well-greased lump of Springer-speak with what seemed like sincerity.The experience of reading Bild is a sugar-rush of gossip, accompanied by the clanging gong of headlines. As is traditional, scandals are designated for the front page, but in Bild’s current iteration, fear-mongering appears to be privileged over celebrity soup: “Germany’s most dangerous gang leader is free again” reads a typical headline. Alongside the main stories, the front page also lists the dollar exchange rate and the price of gold, as well as the “winners” and “losers” of the day. A loser might be Prince Charles, whose charity, according to the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, may have received dark money from Russians. (“Bild says: black money for blue blood!”) Or a loser might be Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister of Russia, claiming that there is a “large, coordinated campaign” by the German government to fund misinformation in Russia: “Bild says: what nonsense!” Winners tend to be businessmen making big deals or celebrities being nice to children.The most reliably absurdist section of Bild typically falls on page 3 or 4, with a report from Paul Ronzheimer, Reichelt’s star protege. There one finds Ronzheimer posing in front of a Brazilian forest fire Ronzheimer posing in front of the Venezuelan opposition leader Ronzheimer posing in front of a Hong Kong street fight Ronzheimer posing in front of Syrian refugees Ronzheimer disbursing fake Drachmas to poor Greeks encouraging them to leave Europe. His stories appear as little frames of text under giant, hard-won selfies, as if to declare: Bild was here! “Ronzheimer does have a discernible function,” says von Lucke. “He makes Bild readers feel like they’re reading a paper that has incredible access, that Bild has a global presence.”As editor, Reichelt sees himself less as a news impresario than as an emotional entrepreneur. “Journalism is basically about emotions, as all of the other news outlets in this country seem to have forgotten,” he told me. Reichelt likes to point out what he sees as the shared delusions of the more “respectable” German press. “Take Merkel,” he said. “Here you have this completely mediocre mind, and the press has created this elaborate mythology around her. That she’s some sort of savage wit in private – which is not true, by the way – and that she’s fantastically clever – which is not true either. She’s just capable of identifying the direction of prevailing winds.”For Reichelt, Merkel represents the depoliticisation of German society, a process that has obscured the faultlines between conservatives and liberals. For almost two decades, at a series of decisive moments, Merkel has deftly stolen her antagonists’ platforms out from under them. In 2003, she phased in a neoliberal agenda in the CDU, but when it nearly backfired at the polls two years later, she started to introduce programmes from the Social Democrats. In the wake of the Fukushima disaster, Merkel became anti-nuclear overnight. Merkel’s response to the 1 million migrants entering Germany in the summer of 2015 has been widely interpreted as an instance of principle over pragmatism – a chancellor seizing the chance to make amends for her nation’s past – but even then, Merkel had carefully weighed German public opinion, and promptly ramped up anti-refugee legislation once the middle class’s pro-refugee enthusiasm had subsided. The leftwing sociologist Wolfgang Streeck once described Merkel as “a postmodern politician with a premodern, Machiavellian contempt for both causes and people”.This shape-shifting has made German politics a much more difficult game to play, and Reichelt sees it as his job to restore the old pre-Merkel isions. To this end, he has made Bild into a loudspeaker for some of the chancellor’s fiercest critics. In early September 2018, in the wake of violent far-right demonstrations in the Saxon city of Chemnitz, Reichelt met with Hans-Georg Maassen, the head of German intelligence, and offered him the the pulpit of Bild when Maassen wanted to contradict Merkel’s account of anti-migrant “hunts” that had allegedly taken place in Chemnitz. Maassen’s attempt to cast doubt on the chancellor’s version of events got him removed from his post, but it transformed him into one of the most vocal martyrs of the German right.Since his earliest teenage years, Reichelt dreamed of becoming the editor of Bild Zeitung. I asked him how someone like himself, born in Hamburg in 1980 – when Bild was still considered radioactive by most teachers and students across Germany – could have concocted such an ambition. “I was born into a family of journalists,” Reichelt told me. “In our household, Axel Springer was a hero, and Heinrich Böll was an enemy.” Reichelt, who perfected his English abroad at Cushing Academy, a boarding school in Massachusetts, looked up to young Bild reporters as bourgeois paladins pitted against the leftwing rabble of 1980s Hamburg, a city teeming with wealth, but also one of the hubs of the country’s anarchist left.It is hard to think of an institution more tightly bound up with the history of the Federal Republic than Bild Zeitung. The first introduction that some young Germans get to the paper today is Günter Wallraff’s withering exposé, Der Aufmacher (The Leader-writer), which continues to be taught in a few secondary schools four decades after its publication. In 1977, Wallraff went undercover in order to try to expose Bild as a giant fabrication mill. Instead he discovered an underworld of cynical publicists intent on becoming cheerleaders of the postwar German economic boom. In one scene, which describes a regular day at the Bild office, one of the Bild reporters listens to a distressed caller who has called into a fake suicide-prevention hotline that Bild has set up, and whispers to Wallraff: “He’s about to jump off the balcony any minute, he’s nearly there!”I visited Wallraff last year in his light-filled studio in the Ehrenfeld neighbourhood of Cologne. His office is full of African art, and the books of his heroes, such as Upton Sinclair. “In the 1970s and 80s, Bild was in total control of the media, and there was very little being done about it,” Wallraff told me, over a game of ping-pong in his workshop. “If you were their enemy, they made you into a terrorist.”We retreated back into Wallraff’s studio, where he had the latest copy of Bild. The headline was about Boris Johnson’s hair: “This mop now rules Britain”. “I haven’t flipped through it in a while,” Wallraff told me. “But I can see it’s taken a more civilised tone. You should have seen it in the 1970s: all of the articles in support of the dictatorship in Greece and Chile, the articles in favour of apartheid.”Wallraff remains a heroic figure for many Germans who remember Bild as an enemy of the student protesters of 1968 – whom the newspaper referred to as “rioters”, “a radical danger”, and “left-academic fascists”. One of Springer’s main targets was the Marxist thinker and activist Rudi Dutschke, who was shot in 1968 in Berlin by a rightwing fanatic inspired by the murderer of Martin Luther King Jr. A few days before the attack, Bild had referred to Dutschke as “State Enemy #1”, and it had previously run headlines such as “Stop Dutschke now!” After the shooting, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Berlin, chanting, “Bild shot as well!”. Dutschke suffered brain damage from the attack, and died years later as a result of his injuries.“West Germany in the 1960s was a completely authoritarian state,” said Gretchen Dutschke-Klotz – Dutschke’s widow, and an author of several books about 1968 – when we met in Berlin earlier this year. “Bild was the symbol of that.” Dutschke-Klotz agrees with Wallraff that Bild is a milder publication today, and that the 1968ers triumphed over it. “Society was full of old Nazis then,” she said. “It was full of people who, outside of the Weimar Republic, had barely lived in a democracy. Bild has been beaten in the cultural sphere, especially if you consider the place of women in society now, or climate politics.”But in the 60s there were others who took a different view: that what they were witnessing was the irreversible Springerisation of society. Heinrich Böll devoted not one, but three books, including one of his literary masterpieces – The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum – to denouncing Bild, which he credited not only with poisoning public life, but also with wrecking the German language itself with “primitive bon-mot-ism”. Bild, wrote Böll in 1972, was “no longer crypto-fascistic, no longer fascisoid, but naked fascism: incitement, lies, garbage”.The most visible element of West Germany’s hard left, the Red Army Faction, and its leading voice, Ulrike Meinhof, took Böll’s criticism a considerable step further. In May 1972, after calling for the expropriation of Springer, and holding public hearings against the company, the Red Army Faction bombed the Axel Springer offices in Hamburg, injuring at least 17 people. Meinhof declared the attacks were in the name of Springer’s victims: communists, Palestinians, foreign workers. “Who else were they going to attack?” Dutschke-Klotz told me. “The mayor of Berlin? He had already apologised for attacking student protesters. Bild was the obvious target.”That was almost 50 years ago. After the cold war, Bild became a celebrity rag, which former adversaries could dismiss as a more innocuous symptom of a depoliticised culture than an ideological lodestar in its own right. Kai Diekmann, who edited the paper from 2001 to 2015, neatly exhibited the contradictions of German conservatism in the Merkel era. A faithful page of Helmut Kohl, he wanted to maintain Germany’s position as the prime European reaper of globalisation – the country’s export model depends on taking advantage of a currency weakened by its fellow Eurozone members – but also attacked expressions of globalisation within Germany’s borders.In his 2007 screed, The Great Self-Deception, Diekmann railed against the usual suspects of the German right: Muslims, “multi-kulti” liberals and environmentalists. Diekmann’s idea was that the leftwards shuffle of the political consensus – exemplified in Merkel’s long-standing coalition with the Social Democrats – needed to be beaten back by an elite-led populist movement that would restore German conservatives to their former glory. The dream was to bring back good old-fashioned German values, but keep the settings of German economic dominance in place. As the political face of this movement, Diekmann favoured Merkel’s defence minister, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, whose impeccably aristocratic credentials and Ted-talk persona would make him the ideal patrician-tribune of Germany’s silent majority. But the dream collapsed in 2011, when Guttenberg fell into disgrace after it was discovered he had plagiarised his doctoral dissertation. Today, the man who was once due to make German conservatism great again runs an investment firm in Manhattan, and lives in Greenwich, Connecticut.Reichelt took over Bild in 2018, after his immediate predecessor, Tanit Koch, who tried to steer the paper in a more anodyne, Merkel-friendly direction, left the position. (Koch has spoken of her exit in cool terms, telling a German news website that she felt she did not have the support of the Axel Springer CEO.) Under Reichelt’s tenure, the paper quickly established itself as a battering ram against Merkel. Bild once again plays the game of guiding and reflecting public opinion on a host of questions. Among its enthusiasms are German cars and the arms industry. “At last! The Leopard-2 tank in Idlib and possibly soon in the fight against Assad’s Russian tanks (T-55, T-62, T-72 and T-90),” tweeted Bild’s political editor about recent events in Syria. “As always, it takes a Turk to use a German tank for what it was built for.”There are a few non-populist positions Reichelt takes that have the appearance of principle. “He has staked out anti-Putin, pro-Nato, pro-Israel positions well beyond the standard German line,” says Niggemeier. But the majority of the paper’s content is an ever-shifting attempt to harness popular discontent rather than indoctrinate readers in any specific programme. Reichelt himself has, for instance, repeatedly come to Merkel’s defence on her decision not to close the border to Syrian refugees in 2015, describing it as an ethical “no-brainer”, but the paper goes to great lengths to associate migrants with crime, and to demand deportations. On the environment, one day Bild might be lamenting Merkel’s call to shutter coal factories by 2038 (“The coal deadline is going to cost us!” ran a headline about the prospective job losses.) But another day you might read that “Our government officials are destroying the environment!” atop an article detailing the 200,000 yearly flights German officials take between ministries in Berlin and Bonn. Like Merkel herself, Reichelt is an arch-opportunist, congenitally averse to letting crises go to waste.Several German journalists I spoke to attributed Reichelt’s heightened focus on Bild’s politics to a desperate attempt to counteract falling readership numbers. One of Reichelt’s heroes, he told me, is Franz-Josef Strauss, a legendary conservative postwar politician, who was famous for his political mantra: “Never allow a party right of the Christian Social Union”. Bild’s competitors on its right today come from Breitbart-esque news blogs such as Politically Incorrect. Bild seems to have done its best to outflank these outlets by covering the same kinds of stories as them, often in much the same tone. In more than one case, these articles have been false. In 2017, the paper ran a story about a mob of Arab men assaulting women in a Frankfurt restaurant, which police subsequently confirmed never happened. On the international front, Bild echoes the calls of prominent German centrist liberals who believe Germany must assume a leading role in world affairs. “You have this ongoing performance whereby they call for Germany to be in the middle of the action, but have no sense of responsibility for what that would entail,” says Blätter editor Albrecht von Lucke. “As soon as you have German troops deployed anywhere, even on the most humanitarian mission imaginable, who will be the first to cry out about it when the first guys fall in the war? Who will demand they come home and that it’s all been a mistake? Bild. You can count on that.” It is the same mentality that led one Bavarian AfD politician earlier this year to tweet against the banning of a beer festival because of Covid-19 – only to go on to sue the city of Rosenheim for the rise in cases after the beer festival did take place.The coronavirus pandemic initially caught Bild – and the German right – off guard. After the government’s strong response to the crisis, Merkel seemed immune to criticism. Bild turned its focus to China. In April, Reichelt published a public letter demanding €149bn in reparations from Beijing for the economic impact of Covid-19. “You shut down every newspaper and website that is critical of your rule,” Reichelt wrote in the letter, “but not the stalls where bat soup is sold.” The stunt made headlines around the world, and predictably enraged the Chinese embassy in Berlin. (A more expansive version of Bild’s letter by Springer’s CEO, calling for the decoupling of western economies from China, appeared in Springer’s respectable daily, Die Welt.) It’s this willingness to play fast and loose with geopolitics, now in a populist vein, that makes Bild, according to von Lucke, “much more dangerous than it ever was before”. (Not that Bild neglected the domestic front. “Despite corona restrictions, 300 people gather at mosque for prayer”, read one headline in April. “Churches closed for fear of Ramadan-chaos,” ran another.)When public impatience with closed schools and shops began to mount in late May, Bild, having failed to gain traction with its usual scapegoats, changed tack. Its new target was Germany’s leading virologist, Christian Drosten, who had become an unexpected celebrity thanks to his measured media interviews and his advisory role to Merkel’s government. On 25 May, one of Bild’s reporters sent him an email, claiming that other experts had serious criticisms of his latest study on Covid-19. The reporter demanded that Drosten respond within an hour. Instead, Drosten published the email on Twitter and said there that he had “better things to do”. The subsequent article, which tried to blow up minor statistical disagreements into a public assault on Drosten’s reputation, backfired drastically. The German mediasphere rallied to his defense: #Ichhabebessereszutun (#betterthingstodo) became a hashtag. Georg Streiter, a former deputy government spokesperson who also used to work at Bild and still praises the paper, called it a baseless smear campaign, and put the blame squarely on Reichelt. “It’s like dog owners,” he said. “The problem is usually at the top of the leash.”“We’re read by more German professors than any other publication,” Reichelt told me when I visited his office in the Axel Springer building in Berlin last year. “We’re read by the businessmen and the workers – and if some read us for ironic reasons, well, that’s fine, too.”The Springer building is a giant glass structure that towers over nearby restaurants and embassies. (A new Springer building, designed by Rem Koolhaas, which resembles a damaged glass cube, has been recently erected across the road.) Outside is a statue of a vaguely leprous-looking Axel Springer. A few streets over, extending more than five storeys up the side of the headquarters of Taz, the leftwing daily, stands another piece of Bild lore: a giant high-relief sculpture of Kai Diekmann’s penis. This ostentatious invasion of the former Bild editor’s privacy, unveiled in 2009, sprouted out of a long conflict that had begun seven years earlier, when Diekmann sued Taz for publishing a satirical article claiming he had undergone penis enhancement surgery in Miami. (At the time the judge ruled that, as the nation’s leading purveyor and profiteer of gossip, Diekmann must learn to live with this jab at this dignity.)With its smartly dressed assistants and ample supply of alcohol, Bild’s headquarters in Berlin succeeds in transmitting a throwback aura. “In case there’s any doubt that I’m a real tabloid editor,” Reichelt said, flashing me his lighter with a naked woman on it, as he lit up a Gauloises Blue in his office. The room was strewn with Americana: a Kennedy photograph, a Reagan biography. On top of a pile of books lay a child’s car seat, next to a contemporary military-grade helmet that Reichelt wore when he covered the Syrian war for Springer. On the floor was a copy of the Financial Times. (“It repays the attention you give it every morning,” he told me. “It’s such a great product.”) I asked him why, in the past couple of years, Bild has reduced the number of naked women in the paper. “It wasn’t for any politically correct reason,” said Reichelt. “It’s just that when so much of your staff is female, and they’re all very professional, it just gets slightly awkward having to rank naked women with them day in and day out.”For the daily editorial meeting, we entered a conference room, where about 12 staffers were seated around a long table, overlooking the Berlin skyline. “What have we got?” Reichelt asked. An image of Ursula von der Leyen was displayed on a big screen. “Can we give her a bit more brightness in her face?” asked one of the women at the table. “She looks a bit lugubrious.” “There we go, there we go – more gravitas now,” said another woman.“What’s going on in that?” Reichelt said, looking at a photo of a musician wearing lederhosen and a high-and-tight haircut. Reichelt was munching on chocolate now. I had been told that Bild editorial meetings could be rough going, but this one was running smoothly.“That’s the folk singer Andreas Gabalier,” said another man at the table. “He going to be awarded the Karl Valentin prize in Munich, but apparently he’s some kind of rightwing hardliner.”“What’s he doing in the photo?” Reichelt asked.“Apparently he’s contorted his body into the form of a swastika,” the man replied.“I don’t quite see it,” Reichelt said.“Couldn’t it just be a walk-like-an-Egyptian dance move there?”“Yes, it’s all a bit unclear.”“All right, we’ll just say that some people interpret it as a swastika.”“Anything on the crime front?” Reichelt asked.“We’ve got a paedophile paediatrician who sexually abused young boys for 15 years.”“What was the ruling on this guy?” Reichelt asked.“Judge has put him away for ever.”“Nice. Great judge. Can I see a photo of him?” A photo of a grey-haired man named Roland Christiani flashed up on the screen. “What a great face! He looks like a professor,” Reichelt said. “Let’s give him a bump in the headline.”“How about ‘Judge locks paediatrician away for ever’?”“I like it!” said Reichelt.“Can I get a show of hands of how many of you are for the proposed speed limit?” Reichelt asked his lieutenants. Merkel’s government was threatening to impose a speed limit on German cars. A few hands went up. “God, it’s just like the country at large – we’re completely ided on this,” Reichelt said. “Why are you against it?” He trained his eyes on an editor.“People just drive too fast. I’m tired of being scared on the autobahn when a car comes by doing 200kmh.”“The trouble is that if you lower the speed limit I can’t make it to Hamburg in two hours any more,” another editor said.“You drive to Hamburg in two hours? That’s insane: maybe there should be a limit,” Reichelt joked.The trouble with the speed limit, Reichelt later told me in private, was that it interfered with the fundamental German ideal of freedom, which is that, within the rules, you can do what you want. “There are too many Germans now waking up to find that if they eat meat and love their car, they’re suddenly Nazis,” Reichelt said. “And that’s exactly how the German left speaks. They speak of their fellow citizens as criminals, as people committing crimes against future generations, and they even want to see if they can perhaps introduce punishments – to formally make this into a crime. But what about all those people who aren’t waiting for the delivery of their new Tesla?” Next year will almost certainly be Merkel’s last as chancellor. She has already relinquished her position as the secretary of the CDU. When it came to the struggle to determine her successor last year – specifically, who would fill the role of secretary – Reichelt personally favoured the millionaire businessman Friedrich Merz over Merkel’s chosen successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. But Reichelt hastened to point out that his favourites don’t get special treatment in Bild. “Did I want Merz to replace Merkel? Probably. Did we hesitate to destroy him? No. Bild ran the interview that fatally damaged his campaign when he claimed he was a millionaire but still middle-class. The power to destroy is Bild’s most valuable weapon, and I would not sacrifice it for anything – not even my own political preferences.” It was a nice line, but Reichelt’s resort to journalistic principle seemed a convenient way to gloss an interview that had, quite unexpectedly, taken on a life of its own.With Merkel’s departure on the horizon, the fight is already brewing at the political centre, as German regional leaders try to outbid each other with the comprehensiveness of their coronavirus crackdowns in a headlong appeal to the aged voters who still determine German politics. In the face of this political future, Reichelt is sanguine. “Trump has shown that anything can happen – that’s just a fact,” he told me. “There is no reason that the future has to be dictated by Green parties and child protesters.”But there seems little chance that Bild will be able to retrieve any viable vintage of German conservative leadership from the cellar. “We have to hope that the radicalisation of Bild, like the rise of autocrats around the world, represents the last gasp of patriarchal thinking,” says Tania Martini, a media critic for Taz. As Bild’s sputtering failure to derail Merkel and her scientists during the pandemic showed, the German public is largely unwilling at present to erge from what it takes to be the steady course. Threats to Bild’s position as Merkel’s leading critic are closer to home: the most scathing recent critique of Merkel’s government has come from outside any established political platform, in the form of a blue-haired, 27-year-old internet influencer who castigated the German political establishment for its record on climate change, welfare, and migration in a 55-minute, copiously annotated YouTube video, which has been viewed more than 17m times.The last time I saw Reichelt in his office, last summer, he wanted to talk about his preferred enemies. “There is Putin,” he told me. “He wants to weaken our German institutions and interfere with our elections. You know why? Because he knows he lives in a piece of shit country – that he has made his country into shit – and so he wants other countries to come down to his level so that his disastrous record can be less easily seen.”Before he could get any further in his diatribe, a Bild reporter lunged into the office. “Piëch is dead,” he announced. The family owner of Porsche, Ferdinand Piëch, had apparently died.“In a pizzeria,” said the reporter. “It seems it was a heart attack.”“Can we get confirmation?” He suggested giving Gerhard Schröder a call.“Sure, we’ll get confirmation.”Piëch had not died in a pizzeria after all, we learned a few moments later, somewhat to Reichelt’s annoyance. But then he quickly picked back up the thread. “Then we have the spineless left at home, that just wants to let Putin and Assad run roughshod over the whole liberal western order. They want to bring the German car industry to a screeching halt, freeze rents in Berlin, starve the economy and keep Germany from doing anything in the world. I remember meeting with some people here in the defence ministry when I got back from covering the war in Syria. Let’s build a no-fly zone in northern Syria, I said. Let’s go do it alone if we have to. But no one in Germany with power knows how to use it – or even wants to use it.”“What about Bild?” I asked.“With Bild,” Reichelt smiled, “it’s the other way around.” • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e814766b60ff64f8ee51b9af28f9f297fbaf671/143_465_3113_1868/master/3113.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a646e2c4cb5c3d3454a84a0889c6bbf6","title":"uk government orders halt randox covid 19 tests over safety issues","story":"Care homes and members of public told to immediately stop using firm’s kitsThe UK government has instructed care homes and members of the public to immediately stop using coronavirus testing kits produced by a healthcare firm after safety problems were discovered.Randox was awarded a £133m contract in March to produce the testing kits for England, Wales and Northern Ireland without any other firms being given the opportunity to bid for the work.Under the contract, the kits are sent to the public and places such as care homes and then delivered back to Randox to check swabs to see if iniduals have the virus.On Thursday the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, told MPs: “We’ve identified some swabs that are not up to the usual high standard that we expect, and we’ll be carrying out further testing of this batch as a precautionary measure.“And while we investigate further, we’re requesting that the use of these Randox swab test kits is paused in all settings until further notice. Clinical advice is that there is no evidence of any harm, the test results are not affected.”The Department of Health and Social Care did not explain the nature of the problem or say how many testing kits have been affected.In a statement, the department said its instruction only “applies to unused Randox test kits, which are clearly marked with that name. Used Randox test kits can still be collected for processing as normal.” Randox said: “As an immediate precautionary measure we have temporarily suspended distribution of home sample collection kits using one particular batchsupplier of swabs. This is a temporary measure and does not apply to our private business which uses a different supplier of swabs.”Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health minister, tweeted: “Ministers overstated testing figures by 200,000 \u0026amp now home testing kits don’t meet safety standards with use of all Randox test kits paused.

These enable public bodies dealing with the coronavirus to urgently award commercial contracts without asking other firms to bid for them.Randox employs the Conservative politician Owen Paterson as a £100,000-a-year consultant. The former cabinet minister and leading Brexit supporter has been a consultant since 2015.Previously Randox has not responded to questions about whether Paterson was involved in securing the contract.  did not receive a response when it asked Paterson for a response.In May, Mark Menzies, the Conservative MP for Fylde in Lancashire, raised the issue of the Randox testing kits in parliament. He said a care home in his constituency where half of the residents had died from coronavirus could not secure testing for other residents.Menzies said: “Six of the remaining residents are displaying symptoms, but they are being told that they will have to wait until mid-June for further tests, following errors made by Randox a few weeks ago.” Hancock said at the time that he would try to resolve the problem."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/546774ba8179fd19d81a10def976192b7f9e306f/0_0_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aba7341f8c332e34e76eb31c8d410063 660w","title":"coronavirus live news brazil cases near 2m as more countries re introduce restrictions","story":"Mexican authorities to impose local restrictions White House says ‘science should not stand in way’ of reopening schools. Follow the latest updatesHere is the full story on the new infections in the Australian state of Victoria: Tokyo reported a record 286 new cases on Thursday, prompting the governor, Yuriko Koike, to call on its 14 million residents to avoid non-essential travel to other parts of the country. The city now has 8,640 cases, accounting for almost a third of the nationwide total of 23,600. Koike warned that a similar number of daily infections would be announced later on Friday.Some parts of Japan are reluctant to welcome tourists, despite the potential economic benefits. A recent poll by Kyodo News found that 26 of Japan’s 47 prefectures thought the Go To campaign should be restricted to certain areas.“The success in containing the virus that regional areas worked so hard for could be undone in a flash,” Tokihiro Nakamura, the governor of Ehime, with just 82 cases, said, according to the news agency.The economy minister, Yasutoshi Nishimura, encouraged people living outside Tokyo to take advantage of the scheme.”We agreed that Tokyo should be temporarily removed, but we are not telling people to stay home,” he told reporters. “Families can still vacation if they are careful and take the proper precautions.”Doctors in Bogota are calling for a return to a strict city-wide quarantine to slow coronavirus infections in Colombia’s capital, warning that medical services are close to collapsing, a leading medic said on Thursday.Russia on Thursday called off its annual “Immortal Regiment” commemoration of the nation’s World War II dead in which thousands carry photographs of relatives through the streets due to the coronavirus pandemic, AFP reports. Organisers had already postponed the event originally scheduled for 9 May but have now dropped plans to stage it on July 26 saying it will only take place once the virus situation in Russia allows it.The indefinite cancellation of the national commemoration points to official jitters over the virus rate, which has fallen gradually and still stands at over six thousand new cases per day.Russia has confirmed 752,797 Covid-19 cases and 11,937 deaths.The air will be freshly piped, the rooms deep-cleaned, and handshakes will be banned. As EU leaders gather for their first physical meeting in Brussels to thrash out a coronavirus recovery plan, no effort has been spared to avoid a local outbreak of the disease.The two-day meeting, thought to be the largest gathering of world leaders since the start of the pandemic, will be the first featuring all 27 heads of state and government since February, when an attempt to agree the EU’s €1tn seven-year budget collapsed in acrimony. On Friday and Saturday, they will return to the same task and will also seek to hammer out a €750bn (£689bn) recovery plan in response to the biggest economic shock forecast in EU history.But any pre-summit bonhomie smoothing the way to a deal will be limited by social distancing. Leaders are being asked to wear masks on arrival and to avoid shaking hands – advice that appears to preclude the air kisses and backslapping that usually accompany the opening of summit talks.Gathering in the Europa headquarters of the European council, nicknamed the space egg, leaders will meet in a fifth-floor room designed to seat 330 people. This will ensure distancing for 30 leaders (27 national ones plus three from the EU institutions) and three or four senior EU officials:Hong Kong has recorded a record 67 new cases of Covid-19, in a growing new outbreak which has seen the city reintroduce widespread restrictions.On Thursday evening health authorities said it was investigating another 67 cases from the past 24 hours, of which 63 were locally transmitted. Worryingly, 35 cases had an unknown source of infection.I cannot say this is a peak because usually you can only say it is a peak afterwards,” the head of the centre for health protection, Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan, told media. “There is still a chance more cases are coming.”Chuang said most of the newly diagnosed people live in the Tsz Wan Shan area and many had visited a local shopping centre and market.“But we also found a few staff of the restaurants and also the customers visiting the restaurants,” said Chuang. “Also we observed quite a number of taxi drivers and also customer-facing staff. Maybe they have met a lot of people and also many of them like to visit cha chaan tengs (Hong Kong-style cafes) and local restaurants.”On Wednesday Hong Kong restaurants stopped allowing patrons to dine in and provided takeaway and delivery only between 6pm and 5am. Twelve types of businesses including gaming centres, gyms, clubs and karaoke venues were also forced to close, and group gatherings are capped at 50 people for public places and 20 for weddings and company shareholder meetings. Public transport passengers must wear masks.The new outbreak in Hong Kong has also set back mooted plans for a travel bubble with Macau and Guandong province. Those entering Guangdong must now provide proof of a Covid test (with a negative result) if they want to cross over the border to mainland China.10 people have died after contracting Covid-19 in Hong Kong since the beginning of the pandemic, and there are currently 319 people in hospital.Hong Kong remains off limits to any non-residents, but the government has now added further quarantine requirements for residents returning from high risk areas.The governor of Georgia is suing Atlanta’s mayor and city council to block the city from enforcing its mandate to wear a mask in public and other rules related to the Covid-19 pandemic, AP reports. Governor Brian Kemp and Georgia attorney general Chris Carr, in a suit filed in state court late Thursday in Atlanta, argue that Atlanta’s mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, has overstepped her authority and must obey Kemp’s executive orders under state law.“Governor Kemp must be allowed, as the chief executive of this state, to manage the public health emergency without Mayor Bottoms issuing void and unenforceable orders which only serve to confuse the public,” the lawsuit states.The move followed an executive order by Kemp on Wednesday that resulted in an ambiguous situation, with Kemp denying local governments could order masks, but local governments arguing it was within their power:Victoria state premier Daniel Andrews has confirmed 428 new coronavirus cases in the state. That is the highest-ever one-day total for an Australian state, and considerably higher than the last record, 317. Three more people have died. That brings the total number of deaths in the state from coronavirus to 32 and the total number of cases to 5,165 .The people who died are a man in his 80s, a man in his 70s, and a woman in her 80s.Some 122 people are in hospital, and 31 are in intensive care.The Australian state of New South Wales has announced tighter restrictions on gatherings, to come into place from Friday next week. State Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the new restrictions “give us every opportunity to keep New SouthWales as open as possible”, as the state confirmed 8 new coronavirus cases, six of which are community transmission cases. The new restrictions are:Berejiklian said funerals would have a lower limit because “they are emotional occasions where people know each other and that increases the risk of transmission”.She said they would not currently change the number of guests you can have in your home, which is capped at 20, but are recommending that 10 is a safe number.We’re not going to change the at this age but in the next little while we ask people to be thoughtful about who they welcome, how many they welcome and especially protect those most vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"National Economic and Social Council sets out actions needed for sustainable recoveryAnalysis confirms Covid-19 lockdown translated to short-term emissions reductions\u0026lsquoI intend to make substantial progress\u0026rsquo on securing our habitats, says Malcolm Noonan"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"A beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creatures"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Video: UCD Enda O\u0027Dowd\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA mask protects the public from the wearer who might not know they are contagious.Ireland got its response to Covid-19 largely right. Case figures and deaths don’t lie. But we got some things wrong – notably on face masks. In spite of remarkable progress, there are no widely available treatments and no immediate prospect of an effective vaccine. Covid-19 still poses the same risk as it did during the pandemic’s first days . The threat of a second wave lurks ever present.That is why making the wearing of face masks compulsory is essential. Ireland is coming late to this approach after much dithering and too much confused messaging.Where are we now on face masks?Wearing face masks on public transport is already mandatory and is to become mandatory in indoor spaces such as shops. We are shifting from “should” wear them to “must” wear them. And because of the extent of health threat, this goes beyond “basic good manners” or respiratory etiquette.The hard lessons from having to implement actions in a nightmarish scenario of constantly emerging knowledge about an insidious global threat don’t need to be raked over. Scaling up effective actions knowing what we do now needs to be the focus.Likewise, the message has to be right browbeating people into wearing them won’t work. We may, however, be at a tipping point. This week, Taoiseach Micheál Martin was out and about wearing a face mask. Many more people have their face covered on public transport – one media report suggested nine out of 10 people on Dublin’s Luas were wearing masks.What’s the latest evidence for wearing face masks?There is no study of scale providing definitive proof but science is about weighing up probability and evaluating risk.A UK study found population-wide face mask use could push transmission down to controllable levels, and prevent further Covid waves when combined with minor lockdowns.A US study found if 80 per cent of a closed population were to don a mask, infection rates would statistically drop to approximately one-twelfth the number of infections compared to “a live-virus population” in which no one wore masks. Emerging evidence prompted the World Health Organization to strengthen advice in their favour.A University of Edinburgh study recently found masks can limit how far exhaled breath travels out by up to 90 per cent, while another study found the daily growth rate of infections fell by 40 per cent after mask use was made compulsory in the German city of Jena. Many are wearing masks, so why are we seeing rising cases?The capricious nature of Covid-19 knows no bounds. It’s clear outdoor transmission is a minimal risk, the big challenge is stopping transmission in indoor settings, where iniduals are in close contact with limited ventilation for a prolonged period of time.Compounding this, according to Prof Devi Sridhar of the University of Edinburgh, is the role presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission can play in spreading the disease – where an infected person spreads the virus before they develop symptoms themselves, or where they never develop symptoms.“Relying only on those with symptoms of coronavirus to self-isolate is not enough to stop transmission given the role that these silent carriers play in its spread,” she wrote in the .Covid-19 exploits those opportunities for infection in confined spaces. Washing hands properly before and after going to such places remains a critical action – wearing face masks while in that zone of potential spread is just as important.So what is the best advice?Face masks do not need to be worn in the open air or while driving a car but should be worn routinely where physical distancing is not possible. A mask protects the public from the wearer who might not know they are contagious.Medical-grade masks are the most effective barrier. Evidence on the protective value of single-use paper masks or reusable cloth coverings is less clear, but still suggests they can contribute to reducing transmission. For those over 60, whose immune system is weakening coinciding with ageing, and those with underlying conditions, the case is clear-cut. Moreover, they should wear medical-grade masks.What about indications of reckless socialising?Reinforcing regulations on mandatory wearing of face masks will soon be in place. Then it’s down to enforcement lack of implementation will quickly undermine credibility. Such measures are justified, especially where inadequate precautions are being taken. Given clusters are increasing around the country – and in spite of much good work curtailing Covid-19 – it suggests wearing a mask has been a matter of inidual choice for too long.Is there an outstanding messaging issue?A perception of invulnerability among young people persists. This necessitates a new approach to messaging, underpinned by great clarity. It should embrace wearing masks handwashing and getting tested quickly if showing signs of Covid-19.Wearing a mask is one of the most important defences in keeping Covid-19 at bay. Widespread adoption will enable further opening up of society and travel between countries with similarly low levels of infection to Ireland. That should be part of messaging too, ie the rewards.The social norm has to be wearing a mask, while accepting some people cannot wear one. We are not there yet. It’s a small price to pay for getting closer to normality – and pushing back that second wave.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Number of new coronavirus cases could rise to over 150 a day by August 10th, says NPHETTeachers, schools and host families deprived of income as foreign students stay awayCovid-19 is causing revenue from manuscript exhibition to plummet from 2019\u0026rsquos \u0026euro12.7mEvent for 500 people was planned before Covid-19 restrictions were extendedT\u0026aacutenaiste says that continuing the commercial rates waiver will also be consideredDr Ronan Glynn says it would be \u0026lsquofoolhardy\u0026rsquo to lift restrictions as cases rise across countryInterview: Minister for Integration insists system will be dismantled within Government\u0026rsquos lifeStudents will have to wait until September 7th to receive their grades this yearDr Syed Shadzad Ali (64), of Newtownforbes, Co Longford, \u0026lsquoprobably exaggerated\u0026rsquoT\u0026aacutenaiste says stimulating demand is \u0026lsquono good\u0026rsquo for venues which are closedMiche\u0026aacutel Martin makes first visit to Northern Ireland since his appointmentAnn O\u0026rsquoDonoghue\u0026rsquos disappearance has \u0026lsquobamboozled\u0026rsquo and alarmed her familyTotal number of deaths from virus now at 1,749, as NPHET warns of rising R-numberConcern for regulars fuses with economic wipeout for publicans in information limboStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"book of kells visitor centre and old library works planned by tcd","story":"Trinity College Dublin (TCD) has lodged major plans for a new visitor centre for its Book of Kells exhibition and urgent works to its 18th-century Old Library.The Book of Kells exhibition last year generated revenues of €12.7 million as more than one million visitors paid to view the ancient and priceless manuscript.However, this year as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, revenues will be only a small fraction of the 2019 figure as the exhibition has been closed since March.The exhibition is due to reopen on August 10th but pre-Covid had relied heavily on foreign visitors accounting for 87 per cent of ticket sales last year. US visitors were the largest international group and made up one-third of the total figure.The new visitor centre is part of the Old Library Redevelopment Project which also includes the refurbishment and alteration to both to the Old Library built between 1712 and 1732 and to the Berkeley Library on the TCD campus.‘Conservation challenges’A spokeswoman for TCD stated: “The Old Library faces a number of conservation, structural and environmental challenges which need to be urgently addressed in order to safeguard the building and its contents for the next century.”She stated: “The pandemic and recent events go to further highlight the importance of preserving this national historic site and improving visitor facilities in keeping with health and safety protocols.”The redevelopment plans recently lodged with Dublin City Council have been two years in the making, led by architects Heneghan Peng, and were concluded just before the Covid-19 lockdown.Documentation lodged with the plan states that the proposal aims to protect the library collection against further deterioration and to improve facilities for visitors and enhance the visitor experience.Crowd managementThe visitor centre welcome and ticketing area is to be located underground while planning documentation shows that crowd management technology is to be installed.TCD wouldn’t be drawn on the costs of the project. The TCD spokeswoman said: “Funding for the redevelopment project is under consideration. The focus on the coming year will be on planning and developing the detailed design and securing planning permission.” On the timescale of the plan, the spokeswoman said: “This is a complex project and its overall duration is currently under consideration. It will depend on a number of factors including the overall planning process and funding for its development.”A decision is due by the city council on the plan at the end of next month.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4306123.1594901470!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus government urges close contacts of positive cases to get tested","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLiz Canavan, assistant secretary general at the Department of the Taoiseach: ‘If you are asked to get a test, please do so’The Government has urged people who are identified as close contacts to positive coronavirus cases to get tested for the condition, following reports some people are not coming forward.Speaking at Government buildings on Thursday, Liz Canavan, assistant secretary general at the Department of the Taoiseach, said the proportion of people who are refusing to be tested is increasing.“Public health doctors are reporting an increase in the number of clusters around the country in recent days but they’re also reporting an increasing proportion of people identified as close contacts of positive cases who, when offerred a test, are not coming forward to be tested,” Ms Canavan said.Ms Canavan was speaking following the Government decision on Thursday to push back phase four of the roadmap for reopening society until August 10th due to a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in the community.The decision means, among other things, that pubs, bars and nightclubs will not be allowed to reopen as planned on July 20th. Currently, pubs are only allowed to operate if they are also providing a “substantial meal” – of at least €9 – to customers.Ms Canavan said that between July 3rd and July 12th, gardaí identified 37 inidual cases where there were “potential breaches of the health regulations . . . even after providing the premises with an opportunity to rectify the situation”.“In all of these cases, gardaí found customers consuming alcohol but no evidence of food also being consumed and no evidence of receipts to show that food has been sold. Files will now be prepared by the DPP in each of these cases,” she added.Ms Canavan said she understands “how disappointing” the decision to pause phase four is for business owners, employees and the public but added it is better to “pause now and avoid risking any reversal”.She explained why the Government made the distinction between food-serving premises and pubs, adding “we all know the difference between our behaviour and our expectations when we go into a restaurant as opposed to a pub”.Ms Canavan said that “to support the sector and, acknowledging the very strong food business for many publicans”, the Government permitted pubs acting as restaurants to reopen.“The National Public Health and Emergency Team have doubled down on their ask of pubs that are open to behave as restaurants, and the guidance on what that means is clear,” she said.Despite the pausing of phase four, and the addition of other measures – such as mandatory wearing of face covering in shops and indoor spaces – Ms Canavan said “we are still in a very good place with the disease”.“The trend in infections has crept up, in a small way and slowly, but that small increase is persisting. The problem is the nature of this disease. It’s highly infectious, it spreads fast.”Earlier on Thursday, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said pubs reopenimg now could “materially add to the possibility of a second wave” of the coronavirus.The Government would be prioritising the reopening of schools and healthcare facilities, the minister told Morning Ireland.Proposals to permit larger gatherings of 100 people indoors, up from 50, and 500 people outdoors, up from 200, will also not proceed as earlier planned.Mr Donnelly also emphasised the need to get the R number down to below one. At present it is between 1.2 and 1.8, if that rate were to continue within three weeks the rate would be up to 150 cases per day, he warned. Mr Donnelly defended the Government’s decision, saying international evidence shows Covid-19 cases increase when pubs reopen. He said “nobody wants these restrictions in place”.

Photograph: Alan Betson  The The final phase of the Government’s roadmap to unlock the Irish economy from coronavirus restrictions may be pushed out beyond August 10th, senior ministers have warned.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar told the Dáil pubs may remain closed beyond August 10th, the new date for the easing of the Covid-19 restrictions.Mr Varadkar said that pubs, nightclubs and other venues will open “no sooner than 10th August. We are not saying they will open on 10th August.”He stressed that it depends “on how the virus behaves” and the numbers of coronavirus cases which were rising, he told the Dáil as he faced angry rural TDs who condemned the decision announced on Wednesday.Minister for Further and Higher Education Simon Harris also admitted earlier that phase four of the Government’s roadmap to reopen the country could be pushed back further if there is an increase in Covid-19 cases.The Government delayed the next reopening phase from the Covid-19 lockdown on Wednesday, postponing the reopening of remaining pubs and resumption of larger gatherings of people until August 10th.Mr Harris said this could be further postponed if cases continue to rise but added “I would hope that not to be the case.”“We can’t presume that Covid-19 is gone because it’s not,” Mr Harris said. The Minister also said the decision not to proceed with the next stage “increases the ability” to ensure children return to education in late August and early September.“I think it would have been a grossly irresponsible thing to ignore public health advice, to move forward with phase four in spite of the public health advice, knowing that we have a huge body of work to do as a country to get our kids back to school and indeed get our learners and students back into third level as well,” he told reporters on Thursday morning.Mr Harris said a “huge body of work” is being led by the Minister for Education Norma Foley to make sure schools can reopen at the end of next month. He said his department is finalising a framework for universities and colleges to reopen.The Minister echoed Mr Varadkar’s comments on Wednesday that the recent rise in Covid-19 cases in Ireland “is not a second wave”.“The Tánaiste is right, there isn’t an indication that there is a second wave here currently, but there are enough warning signs for us to press pause, try and bank the progress that we have made, and I suppose reignite the conversation with each other about the measures we need to take in terms of social distancing, hand washing, cough etiquette and keeping close contacts as minimum as we can,” Mr Harris said.“As of now the indicative date is August 10th but we’ve always been very honest with people. These are indicative dates and they entirely depend on the behaviour of the virus but we are not powerless in that regard,” he said.Mr Harris was speaking at the launch of the National Further Education and Training Strategy at Richmond Barracks in Dublin.Mr Harris said everybody wants to protect their own health and the health of students and staff but “equally we need to get people back to education”.“We can’t live in a country where we’ve nearly opened up everything else except our education sector. I think that would reflect very badly on our values as a country that values education and sees that the benefit of education runs far beyond just academic benefits too,” he said.The Minister also said the country is “absolutely open” to international students this coming semester. Mr Harris said he has heard from some universities that there are international students who would be willing to come to Ireland in September and quarantine for the recommended two-week period.Second waveEarlier Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said it could “materially add to the possibility of a second wave” of the coronavirus of pubs reopened now.The Government would be prioritising the reopening of schools and healthcare facilities, the minister told Morning Ireland.The Government has delayed the next reopening phase from the Covid-19 lockdown, postponing the reopening of remaining pubs and resumption of larger gatherings of people amid concerns over rising coronavirus infections.Plans to allow pubs that do not serve food and nightclubs to recommence business from July 20th has been postponed until August 10th after the State’s health officials raised concerns about an increase in Covid-19 infections as restrictions have been relaxed.Proposals to permit larger gatherings of 100 people indoors, up from 50, and 500 people outdoors, up from 200, will also not proceed as earlier planned.Mr Donnelly also emphasised the need to get the R number down to below one. At present it is between 1.2 and 1.8, if that rate were to continue within three weeks the rate would be up to 150 cases per day, he warned.Mr Donnelly defended the Government’s decision, saying international evidence shows Covid-19 cases increase when pubs reopen. He said “nobody wants these restrictions in place”.He added that he hoped there would be no need for enforcement of wearing face covering in shops.The Minister said that the Government is taking Nphet advice to limit gatherings in homes to no more than 10 visitors.“It’s not 10 people, so if there’s five of you living in the house then you can be up to 15. Nphet have said for no more than four additional households which means essentially whoever lives in the house plus up to 10 people.”He said health are worried about clusters of cases.“What you can have is one person who is infected, but they are asymptomatic, they don’t know they are, they go to a house party, everyone’s talking loudly, there’s plenty of droplets going out into the air, you can end up with 20 to 30 people walking out of that house infected.”Mr Donnelly said the Government did not make the decision lightly.“But the public health advice is if we were to open now it could materially add to the possibility of a second wave and that’s just a risk we can take.”The lifting of the remaining restrictions would depend on the R rating he said. “It’s not one number, it’s not one fact, it’s in the round, where are we going, are we moving away from a second wave or are we moving towards a second wave.”Hospitality industryThe Government’s decision disappointed members of the hospitality industry.The president of the Irish Hotels Federation Elaina Fitzgerald Kane said “hitting the pause button” on the relaxation of Covid-19 regulations will put thousands of jobs at risk at a time when hotel room occupancy is only 30 per cent.The pause will also have an impact on people who had planned gatherings in hotels and wedding venues, she said.Around 18,000 couples this year will have their wedding day plans impacted by Covid-19 with many already changing their arrangements two to three times, she added.However, Infectious diseases consultant Corrina Sadlier has said the Government’s decision to pause the relaxing of the lockdown was the right thing to do.She said she understood this would cause extreme difficulties for the sectors affected, but “nothing about Covid-19 has been easy for anyone”.If the pause had not been implemented the country had been heading towards a second wave, she warned.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4306524.1594933535!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eamon ryan appears asleep in d%C3%A1il as vote on lower paid workers called","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEamon Ryan (centre) appeared to be asleep in the Dáil  when a vote was calledGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan appeared to be asleep when a vote was called on legislation relating to lower-paid jobs.The clerk of the Dáil called Mr Ryan, the Minister for Climate Action, Communications Networks and Transport twice, but both times he did not respond.Footage appears to show him asleep in the Dáil.He was woken up by the newly appointed chief whip Jack Chambers.Other deputies can be heard laughing as Mr Chambers called to Mr Ryan to wake up.Mr Ryan was caught sleeping during a private members motion brought by the Social Democrats which sought to strengthen the rights of worker during the Covid-19 pandemic.Mr Ryan voted against the motion which was opposed by the Government and defeated.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4306500.1594930326!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miche%C3%A1l martin government is working well and making a strong start","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Taoiseach said the Government had been focused on the economic implications of Covid-19 and the preparations of a stimulus package for the economy. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA Wire Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said the Government has made a “very strong start” despite a series of political controversies in its first three weeks in office. He suggested he had never seen a month in which the Dáil had been so productive in producing legislation much of it with the cooperation of the opposition. Since he was appointed Taoiseach on Saturday June 27th, Mr Martin has had to deal with his sacking of minister for agriculture Barry Cowen and grumblings from his party that he had not appointed any minister from the west of Ireland or from the mid-west. He has since appointed Mayo deputy Dara Calleary, who had been chief whip, as Minister for Agriculture to replace Mr Cowen. Mr Martin said he “simply didn’t have enough positions” to satisfy everybody and most members of his party understood that fact. Speaking in an interview with RTÉ’s northern editor Tommie Gorman, Mr Martin added: “My obligation overall is to the people of Ireland. We are going through a challenging time. It’s unprecedented, the impact on our economy and social life and we simply have to deal with that. The party understands that. They want us to get on with that very difficult task.” He said the Government had been focused on the economic implications of Covid-19 and the preparations of a stimulus package for the economy. He reiterated that his decision to sack Mr Cowen was a fair one given Mr Cowen’s reluctance to make a further statement to the Dáil about the circumstances in which he was caught drink-driving on September 18th, 2016.Mr Martin was shown the Garda Pulse file in relation to Mr Cowen’s conviction. Mr Cowen is disputing the facts set out in it that he tried to evade a garda checkpoint. “I was of the view on Tuesday morning that he should go into the Dáil,” Mr Martin explained. “He took a different route. He was taking a legal route. In my view when you are in a ministerial position, you have to account to the Dáil no matter how difficult it is. I don’t think it was tenable, having seen the file, that he wouldn’t go into the Dáil. It was a very difficult decision that I had to take.” While the Good Friday Agreement made provision for a border poll, it also enshrined the principle of consent, he explained. He had been influenced by former SDLP deputy leader Seamus Mallon who told him before he died that communities had to find a way to live with others who had been living in the same area for 400 years.  Mr Martin has set up a united island unit within his department which will look at ways of enhancing cooperation between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland. “We could have a poll in the morning. It could lose or it could win but I’m not sure it would move things on in those areas,” he said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4306441.1594925566!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pub closures we ve lost the best months of the year","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDenis Dineen and son Dylan in Dineen’s in  Macroom: “I am down a fortune since the closure. I was expecting to be closed for four weeks.” Photograph: Michael Mac SweeneyProvisionTom Sweeney, whose family has run Mary Anne’s Bar in Masseytown, Macroom, since shortly after the Famine, considered permanently closing his doors after the Covid-19 lockdown“I wasn’t going to open anymore but the word went out and the locals were on to me. I said ‘Okay I will go again. I feel sorry for all my regulars. I know them all by name. By nickname even,” said Sweeney.Deeply disappointed by the decision to delay reopening public, he said: “People miss the chats. A lot of my clientele are the older generation. They are in seven nights a week and nearly have their own stools in the pub.“I don’t know how the older lads pass away the day now. You could normally time them coming in the door,” says Sweeney, who had up to 40 customers in his bar during busy times before the pandemic struck.Social distancing rules will put “huge pressure” on them “as it’s a small pub”, he went on. “I cancelled my Heineken order this morning. The girl said that the phone isn’t stopping with people cancelling orders.”For fellow Macroom publican Denis Dineen, the postponement is “like a knife in the heart”, since he had restocked the bar and like others in the trade has to continue paying insurance, utilities and accountancy bills.‘Down a fortune’Closure has meant a loss of work for himself, his son, daughter and two part-timers. Serving food was a non-runner for him, since the pub does not have a working kitchen. “I am down a fortune since the closure. I was expecting to be closed for four weeks.”Every pub should have been allowed to open together: “People have flouted it. I heard of lads going in to Cork and drinking for the night and being told “Give me a tenner (for food) and they went across the way and got them a pizza.”In Crosshaven, JP English, owner of the Oar Bar and a trained chef, was able to put on a bar menu so he could open this weekend for the first time since March, but he will not be opening during the week.“Ninety per cent of my customers I would know very well. I have been through births and deaths with them. I have driven them home. I have walked them home. We look out for each other. That is the Irish pub.”In Kilkenny, Arthur Drohan, who runs Andrew Ryan’s pub just off the High Street, on Friary Street, had been looking forward to reopening on Monday, though he always had doubts that it would go ahead.“We were measuring up for various contingencies and things, but because we didn’t have any clear guidelines other than the ones that were given out on June 29th for the restaurants, we were cautious about doing anything we might have to backtrack on.No clear guidance“That’s the main problem – the information wasn’t there,” said Drohan, whose pub remains largely similar to how it looked on March 15th when it closed. Without clear guidance, he has held off on making wholesale changes.“I think the main thing, for me, is I don’t mind not opening if it is in the interests of public safety. I think that’s a good thing, and I would rather stay closed if it wasn’t safe. For customers, staff and anyone.“But why is it deemed safe for a pub serving food to be open under the same guidelines?” he asks, “I have no problem with those venues because they are entitled to open. That’s it. But how can you have a two-tiered system?”For the likes of Drohan and other pubs in Kilkenny, the impact of Covid-19 will be felt for a long time. If the pubs do reopen on August 10th, then it will be almost five months to the day when the decision was made to close.“We’ve lost the best months of the year – the tourist season, the festivals. Your turnover is probably down 50 per cent of the whole year up to now. The leaner months would be November, October, January, February,” he says.However, the next deadline cannot be handled in the same way, he says, arguing that two weeks’ notice must be given: “If we have to put tables elsewhere, put in shelves, put up screens, fine.

Staged deadlines now might look impressive politically but would be unfair to those living in the centres, he adds.The current system has “always been ad hoc” and was never properly planned, he says. “So-called improvements” have been made over the years, but no consistency has been maintained. “Ending direct provision is a key priority,” he says.The coalition’s programme for government states direct provision will be replaced with a “new international protection accommodation policy centred on a not-for-profit approach”, backed by a properly funded current and capital budget.So far O’Gorman has met with Minister for Justice Helen McEntee to discuss the handover of the direct provision portfolio from the Department of Justice to his new department, but both will have to continue to work closely together. A “fairly substantial” number of Justice staff will have to move.Community supportThe support of local communities for the changes to come after the ending of direct provision will be vital, says O’Gorman: “Engage early, engage accurately and engage comprehensively.“The earlier you start speaking to people, the more information you give them and the more correct that information is, the less chance you have for far-right groups to spread malicious lies.”“As soon as a State body is seen to try and be quiet or mysterious, it allows conspiracy theorists on the far right to fan the flames of public concern,” says O’Gorman, who points to the lessons that must be learned from last year’s protests in Oughterard.Asked if he is worried that an Irish pledge to offer own-door accommodation to asylum seekers will spur more arrivals, he says people quit their homes because of violence and persecution in their home countries.“When you look at the dangers people are fleeing – violence, civil war and climate catastrophes – the push factors are massive. It’s these push factors that are going to determine the number of asylum seekers coming to Ireland. I don’t think it’s the pull factors primarily.”The new system may “not satisfy everyone’s demands”, he accepts. But if asylum decisions are made in a shorter time and people can live in a more dignified way, he will feel “we’ve achieved a lot”.The Government could also be “a bit more outspoken about the quiet dictators who through their actions and repression of human rights in their own countries are generating asylum seekers”, he adds.Driving licenceMoving people out of emergency hotel and B\u0026ampB accommodation is a priority to ensure that they get proper supports, while special support services for victims of sexual violence will also be considered, he says.A 2018 attempt to let asylum seekers find work was “embarrassing and complicated”, he says. “I think taking that meanness out of the system is something that we need to look at those small things like making it really hard to get a driver’s licence.”Decisions on asylum applications should be made within nine months to a year, rather than the average 15 months that applied before the pandemic, while asylum seekers should not have to wait nine months before being able to work, he says.Last week’s Ombudsman for Children’s report raises “concerning” information about widespread racism, bullying and exclusion experienced by asylum seeker children in schools throughout the State.“We see from other countries if a gap grows up in that trust ... that creates the potential for trouble in the future.” O’Gorman has himself been the target for social media trolling in recent weeks.However, he declines to debate matters again, saying he has paid “precisely zero attention” to a protest outside Leinster House last Saturday that called for his resignation because he had marched alongside British activist Peter Tatchell at Dublin’s Pride march two years ago.“My focus is on doing this job and I’m not going to be distracted by a small minority no matter how vocal they might be,” he says, adding that he had attended a commemoration of the Srebrenica massacre that day."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4298342.1594287685!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"computing poised to make quantum leap","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIBM Research director Dario Gil with the Q System One computer at the company’s research facility in Yorktown Heights in New York.Henry Ford reputedly said that if he had asked people what they wanted, they’d have chosen faster horses, not cars. In the past two decades, we sought faster transistor-based computers. Yet these may be overtaken by a new beast altogether – quantum computers.Transistors are switches which can be open or shut a 0 or a 1. How to make multiple switches carry out calculations has been known for hundreds of years, but it was only in the 20th century that it was possible to jam millions, then billions, into a microprocessor.“Fundamentally our phones, laptop computers are a network of billions of silicon-based switches,” says Séamus Davis, professor of quantum physics at University College Cork.It is hard to overstate their real-world potential. A quantum computer could crack all our encryption codes, one reason countries carefully monitor their progress. It is not just their potential code-breaking savvy drawing attention. A quantum computer could track atoms, molecules, in real time, and design completely new materials – or solve physics or financial problems that are impossibly complex right now.The quantum world which underpins these capabilities is truly weird. A regular laptop may run with 32 bits, which means its central processing unit can accept one 32 bit number. Each of the 32 transistors is open or closed, set at zero or one. “In the quantum world a qubit is not just one number but two, because it can be open and shut at the same time,” Davis explains.“A qubit can be a zero and one and everything in between,” says Dr Heike Riel, scientist at IBM research labs in Zurich. “This is a big difference to classical computing, because qubits now contain much more information, which you can use in your calculation.” Today’s typical microprocessor boasts about 10 billion transistors. Adding one transistor means nothing – to double performance, you need to double the number of transistors.“That is an enormous number and would make the computer billions of times faster, because the same device can deal with multiple numbers,” Davis adds. “This is called exponential speed up and is a fundamental reason why quantum computing is so important.”IBM was the world’s pioneer in quantum computing. Google joined in the race within the last decade to develop powerful quantum computing. Last October, it reported that its Sycamore processor (with 53 qubits) vastly outperformed a classical supercomputer – hailing this as quantum supremacy, sounding like a James Bond movie, and making the cover of the prestigious science publication Nature.“It is a revolutionary achievement,” Davis says. “It puts pressure on the global information technology sector, not because this computer is guaranteed to sweep away silicon-based computing, but because it might.” The anodyne-sounding Sycamore zoomed two billion times faster than the best supercomputer, at a specific test (a task which IBM was quick to point out had no real-world uses).IBM’s quantum computing also made the cover of Nature twice in recent months – for a quantum chemistry puzzle and machine learning. An IBM data-centre facility outside New York hosts 15 quantum computers, the largest being a 53-qubit computer.These are available to about 100 clients who experiment with algorithms, and include finance, chemicals, oil and gas and the car companies. In 2016, IBM opened up free access to its five-qubit device, which readers can log on to to try.Quantum computers run at temperatures chillier than outer space. This is because they rely on superconducting materials, which work at close to zero degrees Kelvin. There is no immediate prospect of even universities installing these devices on site. Quantum computers today are as big as a garage, and require massive cryogenic plants necessary for super-cold temperatures.However, there is no law to say that superconducting materials are restricted to extremely low temperatures. “In principle, they could exist at room temperature,” says Davis. “They just haven’t been discovered yet.”He seeks new superconducting materials that can operate at liquid nitrogen temperatures. “There’s a race on worldwide to find these materials,” says Davis, who says you need a combination of intuition, collaboration with genius colleagues, good luck and hard work.Scientific creativityThere is no reason Ireland cannot play a role in finding new superconductors or in quantum computing. “Most of the work necessary to make a commercially viable quantum computer has not yet been done, and that work mostly involves scientific creativity,” he says. “If Ireland invests enough resources, I’m very confident it could play a major role.”Billions of dollars are invested publicly in quantum computing around the world. Science agencies in the UK, Canada, Japan, Korea, Germany and Russia see quantum computing as hugely significant for reasons of national security. This funding is the tip of the iceberg.“Countries and federations are intensely focused on quantum computing, because of cybersecurity and cyberwarfare issues,” Davis adds. Secrecy abounds.Innocuous-sounding companies in North America and the Far East are hiring experts in this area. It is like rocket science in the 20th century, he says: “You didn’t publish how your rockets worked because they were so strategically important.” A quantum computer could potentially hack satellites, power infrastructure or the most secure classical computers.Davis stresses that if quantum turns out to be the future of computing, Ireland will need expertise and trained people to attract future industry. “If there is a sudden paradigm change, at least then you won’t be left out in the cold. You will have some people who know what is going on.”Most experts predict quantum computers will work alongside classical computers, at least initially."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Two other teenagers who ate meat from same infected animal being treated with antibioticsAlmost 4cm-long nematode roundworm is thought to have come from raw fishThousands displaced after heavy rains trigger flash floodingMove after Japan\u0026rsquos capital records highest daily cases \u0026ndash 224 \u0026ndash since pandemic beganInfluential sister of Kim Jong-un says meeting makes no sense without reward for PyongyangMayor was reportedly subject of criminal investigation into sexual assault allegationsBilateral military deal driven by Tehran fury at bombs and arson blamed on US and IsraelBeijing calls on Australia to stop interfering following response to China imposing new security law in territoryGlory to Hong Kong, deemed to contain \u0026lsquostrong political messages\u0026rsquo, can no longer be sung or playedMost deaths have come from hardest-hit Kunamoto prefecturePM\u0026rsquos image undamaged as Bharatiya Janata party proves adept at deflecting blameFor three decades the armies of the two most populous countries have been patrolling a disputed border in the HimalayasDozen people missing on southwestern island of Kyushu as government pledges to boost rescue effortsArmy deployed to patrol the NSW and Victoria borders, closed for first time in 100 yearsFlooding and mudslides on Kyushu force hundreds of thousands to evacuate homesGlobal wrap: Subcontinent overtakes Russia, as border between Australian states to closeNew law leaves pro-democracy protesters unsure of where Beijing has redrawn the lineFourteen presumed dead while dozens remain missing in southern part of countryMore than 75,000 evacuated in southern region after landslides and torrential rainZheng Yanxiong will work with police to stamp out pro-democracy demonstrationsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Endeavour intended to stoke Arab and Muslim pride over rich heritage of discoveryCases confirmed in doctors and nurse with concern virus will move fast through campsHealth officials say country in \u0026lsquodangerous place\u0026rsquo after early success in curbing epidemicSpeculation grows that \u0026lsquofire\u0026rsquo may have been deliberate attack on facilityIsrael\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4302587.1594542601!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk government announces 700m for britain eu border","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUK cabinet office minister Michael Gove said the major investment would ensure traders and the border industry are able to “manage the changes and seize the opportunities” when the transition period ends in December. Photograph: PA WireMore than £700 million is to be spent on building new infrastructure, hiring staff and developing technology to ensure Britain’s border systems are fully operational when the UK leaves the EU at the end of the year.UK cabinet office minister Michael Gove said the major investment would ensure traders and the border industry are able to “manage the changes and seize the opportunities” when the transition period ends in December.The £705 million package includes £235 million for staffing and IT systems, and £470 million for port and inland infrastructure to ensure compliance with new customs procedures and controls.New border infrastructure will be built inland where there is no space at ports, while ports will get one-off financial support to ensure the right infrastructure is in place.Of the £235 million for staffing and IT systems:The funding relates only to the implementation of the mainland Britain-EU border, and the UK government is expected to publish specific guidance and measures for Northern Ireland in the coming weeks.Mr Gove said: “We are taking back control of our borders, and leaving the single market and the customs union at the end of this year bringing both changes and significant opportunities for which we all need to prepare.“That is why we are announcing this major package of investment today.“With or without further agreement with the EU, this £705 million will ensure that the necessary infrastructure, tech and border personnel are in place so that our traders and the border industry are able to manage the changes and seize the opportunities as we lay the foundations for the world’s most effective and secure border.”The transition period is set to end at the end of December 2020, when the UK will leave the single market and customs union.The funding package comes ahead of a public information campaign in which guidance will be given to traders and hauliers explaining what they may need to do to prepare for the end of the transition period.Meanwhile, the Sunday  reported that Chancellor Rishi Sunak is poised to introduce tax cuts and an overhaul of planning laws in up to 10 new freeports.Mr Sunak is said to be planning to open bidding for towns, cities and regions to become freeports – where UK taxes and tariffs will not apply – in his autumn Budget.The paper said the ports will be “fully operational” within 18 months of the UK leaving the customs union and single market at the end of this year. – PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states.

The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

Scrutiny can be all the more exacting for being born of tribal malice rather than Socratic truth-seeking. The US is riven – it has managed to politicise the workaday face-mask – but it avoids the equal and opposite danger of unreflective consensus.Except, that is, on the most momentous policy of the century. To be in Washington is to sense a nation sliding into open-ended conflict against China with eerily little debate. Politicians who can be counted on to dispute the colour of the sky or the sum of two plus two are of a piece on the necessity of a superpower duel. In the Rambo trailers that pass for his campaign ads, Joe Biden faults President Donald Trump’s China line only for its softness.Nor is the Democratic candidate for the White House a rare belligerent in his party. Chuck Schumer, who leads it in the Senate, has urged the president to “hang tough” on tariffs for “strength is the only way to win with China”. He was not pressed to say what in the historic record justifies this coffee-mug banality, or against which nation he would ever counsel weakness. No, that would require debate. Neither in Washington nor in the corporate sector is there much to be found, at least on the record. Academics have been more forthcoming with their qualms, but not in great number or to great effect.The result is that un-American thing, consensus, and it concerns not just the future but increasingly the past. Everyone now “knows” that pre-Trump Washington was a place of Whiggish credulity, forever betting on material enrichment to make of China a vast Japan or South Korea: a democracy, a friend. In this account, its admittance to the World Trade Organisation was the inadvertent crowning of a rival by American enablers.Leave aside the slander against presidents from George HW Bush (who defied Beijing to arm Taiwan) to Barack Obama (who put tariffs on Chinese tyres). Leave aside the idea that America’s only options are liberal naïvéte and a second cold war. As in the 1940s, when the US was said to have “lost” China to communism, the premise here is that Earth’s most populous country, and oldest living civilisation, rises and falls in response to US policy. That it has agency of its own, that its post-1978 reforms were going to restore its stature anyway is, in Washington, a more exotic suggestion than it should be.Minority reportsNone of this is a plea for (how easily the Soviet-era patter returns) detente. It might be that a US-China struggle is not just defensible, but ordained. We know the international-relations theory by now. A surging power, an established one a one-party state, a democracy: the raw materials for conflict are there. But it is possible to believe all this and still feel unnerved by the lack of public deliberation and prominent dissenters. Even at the dawn of the cold war, there was Senator Robert Taft to argue against Nato. There was diplomat George Kennan, the 20th century’s most unwittingly important man, who viewed “containment” as a bellicose misreading of his advice. And these minority reports were filed in a much more deferential America than today’s.The absence of such voices now is disconcerting. For it means that policy is not being refined and stress-tested through argument. It is no longer clear, for instance, if US grievances stop at China’s trade practices or reach into its domestic treatment of its own people. Mikes Pence and Pompeo, the vice-president and secretary of state, flag the second more often than Trump does. Democrats mention it more than Republicans. This mission creep, if it is afoot, rather matters. An economic rivalry would be fraught enough. One that pits governing philosophies against each other is much harder to finesse.Another implication of the consensus is that dissent is becoming a political no-no. There is a dark past to contend with here. It is forgotten that McCarthyism’s breakthrough had little to do with Russia. It was that alleged loss of China. American diplomats were hounded by their own lawmakers (the right mastered cancel culture first). When President Harry Truman cashiered general Douglas MacArthur, who itched to strike China, not everyone sided with civilian over military power.Washington now is nowhere near that level of frenzy. Even by the standards of an election year, though, the reluctance to say anything construable as “soft” is impossible to miss. America’s ultimate advantage is the raucousness of its public discourse. On the China question, it is troublingly civilised. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Read more about the Donald Trump administrationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"150 jihadis could attempt come uk isil bride shamima begums","story":"Up to 150 terror suspects stripped of their British citizenship could attempt to return to challenge those rulings if Shamima Begum’s case stands, the security services and politicians fear.The warning follows an unprecedented court of appeal judgement on Thursday that Begum, 20, should be allowed to return to the UK to fight the Government\u0027s decision to revoke her British citizenship for joining Isil in Syria.The three judges, led by Lord Justice Flaux, ruled that the Jihadi bride, who left the UK aged 15 to join Isil, could not have a “fair and effective” appeal unless she was present in person to give “proper instructions or provide evidence.”They said this outweighed any risks to national security which could be “addressed and managed” if she returned to the UK.Within minutes of the judgement, the Home Office said it would appeal the “very disappointing” ruling and seek a stay on her return until the appeal was complete.The security services and senior politicians fear the estimated 150 terror suspects deprived of their citizenship and their lawyers will be studying the judgement to see if they could make similar appeals.A Whitehall source said: “Any returning jihadi is a headache. Anybody who went out there to join Isil is problematic. We would have concerns about anybody who has been in her situation. Even if you didn’t think she was dangerous, you would have to switch resources to put her under surveillance.”Sajid Javid, who as Home Secretary revoked Begum’s citizenship, said he was “deeply concerned.” “First and most critically, allowing her - and indeed other terrorists - back into the UK to pursue an appeal would create a national security risk that cannot be fully mitigated, even with the ision of significant resources,” he said.“Second, the judgement and precedents set in this case could bind the hands of the Government in managing past and future cases.“And third, a consequence of this inidual walking our streets would be that it serves as a lightning rod for both Islamist and Far Right terrorists.”Dr Alan Mendoza, executive director of the Henry Jackson Society, said: “The deeply troubling implication of this judgment is that up to 150 terrorists are now legally entitled to enter the UK in order to appeal the decision in their case.    “The already overworked security services will have their work cut out with this potential sudden influx. This decision could have dramatic repercussions for our entire counter-terror strategy.”  It is thought the Court of Appeal has never made such an order before in relation to suspects barred from the UK and stripped of citizenship.  Jonathan Hall, QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, told The Daily  that Begum’s personal situation appeared to have been highly influential in the case.  He said judges did not want to prejudge the issue of her citizenship but recognised how young she was when she left the UK and felt able to conclude that her national security risk was “less serious” than others and could be managed.  Mr Hall believed it could have ramifications for some among the estimated 60 British children born to Isil fighters and their mothers who might be in a similar situation.  “Undoubtedly other iniduals will seek to align themselves with Begum’s position, but it is unlikely that this judgment would apply to everyone who left the UK to join Da’esh,” he said.Begum, who married an Dutch-born Isil fighter and is currently living in a refugee camp in northern Syria, has previously said she had “no regrets” over her time with Isil and sparked outrage by claiming the Manchester terror attack was justified.”She is challenging the removal of her UK citizenship on the basis that the Government’s claim she has dual UK-Bangladesh nationality is wrong because Bangladesh is refusing to accept her and she has never lived there. Britain would be in breach of international law if found to have made her stateless.If she returns, ministers fear she will never leave or be extradited as Bangladesh has not only rejected her citizenship but also has the death penalty for terrorists. “Regardless of the final outcome to her case, if Ms Begum was to come to this country, it will prove impossible to subsequently remove her,” said Mr Javid.However, former defence minister Tobias Ellwood said Britain should take her back: “We should follow the American example and say it\u0027s a British problem. She was indoctrinated in Britain, the idea that we just palm her off is ignoring our responsibilities to look after British nationals.”Five Britons stripped of citizenship who may benefitIslamic convert Jack Letts, 25, dubbed Jihadi Jack, dual UK-Canadian citizenship, left UK to join Isil after dropping out of schoolJihadi brides Reema Iqbal, 30, and sister Zara, dual UK-Pakistani citizenship, left east London for Syria in 2013Law student Ashraf Mahmud Islam, 23, dual UK-Bangladeshi citizenship, left London for Syria in 2015Mahdi Hashi, 30, dual UK-Somali citizenship, was jailed by a New York court for supporting the terrorist organisation al ShabaabMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russias cozy bear hunted coronavirus vaccine secrets","story":"The Kremlin was cock-a-hoop. Vaccine trials for coronavirus, funded by Russia\u0027s sovereign wealth fund, had gone so well at two separate institutions that Vladimir Putin could look forward to announcing the world\u0027s first approved vaccine for the virus by the end of the year. Kirill Dmitriev, the chief executive of the powerful Russian Direct Investment Fund, a close ally of President Putin, announced at a press conference in Moscow on Thursday that advanced Phase III trials would begin next month, with a plan to produce 30 million doses of coronavirus vaccine by December.Lucrative manufacturing deals had been signed with five other countries to produce a further 170 million doses, said Mr Dmitriev.Almost 2,000 miles away in London, just as Russia was boasting of its breakthrough, intelligence agencies in the UK were painting a different picture, announcing that they had uncovered a plot by Russian actors that has targeted coronavirus vaccine development in the UK, the US and Canada.The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), a branch of GCHQ, said it had found evidence that a cyber hacking group – Advanced Persistent Threat 29 (APT29), better known in the cyber sphere as Cozy Bear – had attempted to steal vaccine secrets being developed in the UK at both the University of Oxford and Imperial College London.Cozy Bear is run by Russian intelligence agencies, either the SVR (equivalent to MI6) or the domestic FSB (formerly the KGB).The prize is clear, because any country that produces a coronavirus vaccine first will have a huge advantage in getting their economy fully functioning before any other. APT 29 had also tried to hack into vaccine research centres in the US and Canada, and on Thursday, the three allied countries decided they had had enough and chose to call out the Russians.Intelligence agencies were guarded about the success of the attacks, which have been launched regularly since the centres first started trying to find a vaccine. We condemn these despicable attacks against those doing vital work to combat the coronavirus pandemic, said Paul Chichester,  NCSC Director of Operations, in a rare intervention in the normally secret world in which the intelligence agencies operate.A source said: APT29\u0027s campaign of malicious activity is ongoing, predominantly against government, diplomatic, think tank, healthcare and energy targets to steal valuable intellectual property.The NCSC gave a large amount of detail, even releasing the digital fingerprints of the tools used by the Cozy Bear hackers in an attempt to help institutions update their cyber defences to protect themselves against similar attacks.That information, released on Thursday, included the IP addresses of servers used by the Russian hackers to control their software, as well as other snippets of code which cybersecurity experts can use to update their networks to automatically scan for and remove the malware.Experts said the attacks were sophisticated, reliant on funding from Russian intelligence to develop Cozy Bear\u0027s cyber weaponry. Cozy Bear had developed two new forms of malicious software – WellMess and WellMail – which allowed them to silently search for research data and funnel it out of the university computer systems without raising alarms.WellMess acts as a portal to smuggle out stolen documents, while WellMail sends hackers information on the username of whoever is logged in to a computer.The software had never publicly been named or examined until the disclosure of the coronavirus hacking attempts.Whitehall sources said there was nothing audacious about the attacks. In stark contrast to the Kremlin-sanctioned, attempted assassination in Salisbury of Sergei Skripal using military-grade nerve agent, the hackers have been operating from the safety of Russian soil.This is a classic Russian modus operandi of trying to steal our intellectual property, said a Whitehall security source.Reports have suggested the Cozy Bear hackers work from office blocks in St Petersburg and Moscow, as well as universities.The Putin regime has for years recruited thousands of promising young computer programmers who could use their expertise for hacking into computer systems in other countries, and on Thursday, investigators working within GCHQ, NCSC and MI5 were confident enough to declare for the first time that Cozy Bear is an offshoot of Russian intelligence.The hackers strike by testing vulnerable systems and finding weak points. They can send out so-called spear phishing emails which impersonate someone the target already knows, such as their manager or a university IT administrator.According to experts, these fake emails tricked targets into logging on to websites which appear to be legitimate university web pages but are actually cleverly designed fakes. When university researchers logged on to the fake pages, they handed their usernames and passwords to Russian hackers.The hackers also frequently scanned the internet in search of any stolen passwords and saved up a large database of stolen credentials in case they ever became useful for future hacking campaigns.It is not as though Oxford wasn\u0027t aware of the threat. The vaccine research is being carried out at the state of the art Jenner Institute, on the edge of Oxford and a couple of miles from the historic university centre.Last month, Professor Adrian Hill, the director of the Jenner Institute and the co-leader of the Oxford vaccine project, told The  that his team were regularly targeted by nuisance people sending so-called phishing emails.The NCSC, he said, was helping the university defend its research from cyber attackers.You know, there are serious IT people who are giving us a huge amount of priority, he said. We treat it very carefully.”Guards had been placed at entrances to the building. I guess they\u0027re stopping anyone who might want to break in and steal the vaccine, which we could take as a compliment, I suppose, he said. But the main issue is data security. We take it extremely seriously.Cozy Bear has spent years honing its skills, and has become particularly adept at breaking into organisations in search of classified information.It first came to public attention when hackers broke into an American research organisation and planted what appeared to be an innocent-looking video of monkeys wearing shirts and ties. But when amused employees shared the video, in the background the file spread malware inside networks that gave hackers access to secret files.In 2014, the Dutch secret services pulled off an audacious intelligence coup by hacking into the security camera system used in a Moscow university building that housed members of Cozy Bear. Dutch spies watched them plan an attack on a US government network which was subsequently thwarted.It didn\u0027t stop the group and, in 2016, Cozy Bear hacked into the US Democratic National Committee alongside a rival Russian group, Fancy Bear. The hack may have changed the course of the US presidential election. After that, Cozy Bear went quiet for a couple of years before targeting Eastern European countries.It is unclear whether the attempts to steal vaccine secrets were successful. There are currently two rival research teams developing coronavirus vaccines in Russia – one at the Gamalei National Research Centre for Epidemiology and Microbiology and another at the Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University.Sechenov is backed by the Russian health ministry, while vaccine trials at the Gamalei Institute are funded by Russia\u0027s sovereign wealth fund. The Gamalei Institute, it should be stressed, is a reputable research centre.Russia has denied responsibility. We do not have information about who may have hacked into pharmaceutical companies and research centres in Great Britain, said Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for President Putin.We can say one thing – Russia has nothing at all to do with these attempts.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sir patrick vallance working home perfectly good option many","story":"Working from home should remain in place, the Government’s Chief Scientific Advisor has indicated, despite speculation that Boris Johnson will on Friday encourage employees to return to work.  In a lengthy session before the House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee, Sir Patrick Vallance appeared to signal a growing ide between scientists and Downing Street on health issues, including homeworking, face masks and the lockdown. Senior Government sources said Mr Johnson would set out details of a ‘road map’ for the next nine months, explaining what could happen in the fight against coronavirus under various different scenarios through the coming winter and beyond.The Prime Minister is expected to announce that it is time for workers to return, following warnings from the Governor of the Bank of England that working from home is holding up the economic recovery.But Sir Patrick indicated that it was too soon for a mass return. “We\u0027re still at a time when distancing measures are important,” he told MPs.“Of the various distancing measures, working from home for many companies remains a perfectly good option because it\u0027s easy to do.“I think a number of companies think it\u0027s actually not detrimental to productivity. And in that situation, there\u0027s absolutely no reason I can see to change it.Giving evidence, Sir Patrick also said that the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) had advised the government to implement lockdown on March 16, but Mr Johnson did not announce the measures until March 23.Mr Hancock, the Health Secretary, responded by commenting “Of course, March 16 is the day when I came to this House and said that all unnecessary social contact should cease. “That is precisely when the lockdown was started and... it is unusual to be attacked for saying exactly the same as the chief scientific adviser.”Sir Patrick also warned of problems with face masks ahead of new rules coming into force to make shoppers wear protection from July 24.He removed his own face mask while giving evidence saying that it was not necessary when maintaining social distancing indoors.Sir Patrick told MPs that masks had a marginally positive value in enclosed spaces where crowding could occur, but that prolonged use indoors is very difficult and comes with all sorts of problems. “On balance they have  a positive effect in terms of stopping people catching it from you, and in certain environments. Mr Johnson is expected to set out the next stages of the Government\u0027s coronavirus response on Friday.He is likely to encourage more people to return to work and to use public transport, despite Sir Patrick\u0027s comments, but could stop short of changing the official guidance that says people should work from home if they can.A source said: “If the cases continue to fall we can move forward with returning life to something closer to normal.“But, he is likely to talk about the need for more local lockdowns if there are further local outbreaks.”Key to avoiding another national lockdown will be a new target of having the capacity to carry out 500,000 antigen tests per day – the tests that determine if someone currently has the virus.It would enable all 360,000 of the people expected to have flu-like symptoms each day during the winter cold and flu season to be tested to see who needs isolation.It would also mean blanket testing of local populations could be carried out following outbreaks, regardless of whether people have symptoms or not.The fact that Mr Johnson will set out plans that go into next spring is further evidence that the Government expects the virus to remain a problem well into next year, meaning measures such as social distancing and wearing face coverings could continue for many months to come.The Prime Minister is concerned that the economy is recovering more slowly than had been hoped after most lockdown restrictions were lifted amid fears people are still too anxious about commuting and working in close proximity to colleagues.  Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey also said that unless workers returned Britain will be in a recession for a long time.He is concerned about the impact of office workers staying away from their places of work, with the knock-on effects felt in shops and cafes which usually benefit from their trade.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge

enough herd immunity prevent second coronavirus","story":"The UK may have already achieved a sufficient level of herd immunity to stop a second wave of coronavirus, an Oxford University study has suggested.Scientists believe the threshold of herd immunity may have been lowered because many people may already be immune to the disease without ever having caught it.According to a new model produced by an Oxford University team led by Professor Sunetra Gupta, as little as 20 per cent of the population may need to be resistant to the virus in order to prevent a new epidemic spreading.It is widely believed that the herd immunity threshold (HIT) required to prevent a resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 is in excess of 50 per cent for any epidemiological setting, the study says.Here, we demonstrate that HIT may be greatly reduced if a fraction of the population is unable to transmit the virus due to innate resistance or cross-protection from exposure to seasonal coronaviruses. These results help to explain the large degree of regional variation observed in seroprevalence and cumulative deaths, and suggest that sufficient herd immunity may already be in place to substantially mitigate a potential second wave.Leading experts have already suggested that a sizeable number of people may have immunity against coronavirus because of its similarity to viruses including the common cold.The Oxford model, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, suggests that when resistant people mix with non-resistant people, the herd immunity threshold drops sharply.Read the full study hereGiven the mounting evidence that exposure to seasonal coronaviruses offers protection against clinical symptoms, it would be reasonable to assume that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 itself would confer a significant degree of clinical immunity, the study says.Thus, a second peak may result in far fewer deaths, particularly among those with comorbidities in the younger age classes.Last month, Sir John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University, who is working with a team at Oxford to develop a vaccine, said there was likely to be a background level of protection for a significant number of people.There is probably background T-cell immunity in people before they see the coronavirus, and that may be relevant that many people get a pretty asymptomatic disease, he said.More from

months of sweeping restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic.President Donald Trump in March  banned travelers from most European countries as Covid-19 cases soared in the region before the disease

This can reach temperatures of more than a million degrees Celsius.That is 300 times greater than the surface of the star, which is a comparatively chilly 5,500 degrees Celsius.Despite decades of study, the mechanisms that heat the corona are still not fully understood, but such discoveries are vital in the study of solar physics.It is possible the nanoflares could be the key to unlocking this mystery.NASA shares time lapse footage of the sun over a decadeYannis Zouganelis, Solar Orbiter deputy project scientist at ESA, said in a statement: “It’s obviously way too early to tell, but we hope that by connecting these observations with measurements from our other instruments that ‘feel’ the solar wind as it passes the spacecraft, we will eventually be able to answer some of these mysteries.”“We are all really excited about these first images – but this is just the beginning,” said Daniel Muller, ESA’s Solar Orbiter project scientist. “Solar Orbiter has started a grand tour of the inner solar system, and will get much closer to the Sun within less than two years. Ultimately, it will get as close as 42 million km, which is almost a quarter of the distance from Sun to Earth.”The temperatures of the campfires will be tracked using a tool called the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (Spice), which takes images using ultraviolet light.“Spectroscopy is a powerful tool for the diagnostic of fundamental processes in hot plasmas. Each spectral line gives us a piece of the puzzle – combining information from all lines reveals the amazing complexity of the atmosphere,” said Dr Andrzej Fludra, the Spice Instrument Consortium lead.The Solar Orbiter has ten sensors: six to monitor the Sun and its surroundings, and four to monitor the environment around the ship itself.These include the Orbiter’s Solar Wind Analyser, which measures heavy charged atoms of carbon, oxygen, silicon, and iron in the solar winds from the Sun’s inner heliosphere. By comparing the data between the sensors, scientists will also be able to better understand how solar winds are generated. Solar winds are charged particles sent from the Sun that can affect the entire solar system.“Already our data are revealing shock waves, coronal mass ejections, phenomena called ‘switchbacks’ and fine-scale waves in the magnetic field that we are only able to see thanks to the extreme sensitivity of our instrument,” said Professor Tim Horbury from Imperial College London.Nasa delays trip to Mars after rocket problemNASA shares time lapse footage of the sun over a decadeNasa asks for ideas for toilets for astronauts to use on the MoonNasa plans to fly a helicopter on MarsOn occasion, the Sun pushes out a great number of particles into space. These are called “coronal mass ejections” and, when they hit the Earth’s magnetic field, they can cause a huge surge of electrical current.On Earth, these events can disrupt and damage satellites, affecting people’s mobile phones, GPS signals, and electricity networks.The largest one to hit the Earth happened in 1859 and caused telegraph wires to short out, sparking fires. If the same event happened today, it could potentially cause continent-wide blackouts and severely damage the electrical grid.Such damage could take months or years to repair, at a cost of up to £300bn to the UK economy.The Solar Orbiter itself was part of a combined effort by many countries: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, as well as Nasa in the United States.It was built in the UK by Airbus Defence and Space, and launched from Nasa’s Cape Canaveral site in Florida on 10 February.The Solar Orbiter will eventually get closer to the Sun than the planet Mercury, the solar system’s closest planet to the Sun.Gravitational forces from Venus and Earth will be used to direct the craft. By November 2021, it is expected to be in operational orbit.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Leicester may have been the first, but it was never going to be the last. After a recent spike in Covid-19 infections, Blackburn with Darwen has become the second local authority to have taken preventative action and tighten certain restrictions as the country continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic. The Lancashire council has not gone as far as its East Midlands counterpart in imposing a lockdown – residents have instead been told to limit the number of people they accept into their homes, and to wear face coverings in all enclosed public spaces – but the leaders and people of this northwestern region know what is waiting around the corner.“We do not want to end up like Leicester,” councillor Paul Marrow tells The Independent. “It’s all about being proactive, which is the approach we’ve taken.” Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFor now, the resurgence of the virus in these parts appears small by comparison. Whereas Leicester recorded roughly 155 cases per 100,000 people prior to its lockdown, Blackburn with Darwen has, to date, reported a peak rate of 47 infections per 100,000. But all fires start from a single spark – and authorities here are doing what they can to put out the growing flames.Focus has turned to the danger of household transmission across Blackburn and its neighbouring towns. Unlike in Leicester – where officials have struggled to pinpoint the source of the city’s outbreak – local health authorities for Blackburn with Darwen have managed to develop a clear picture of the way in which the disease has spread within the region.“It seems to be household clusters where a person who has been infected may not know it, they may be asymptotic they return home and then pass it on to four or five family members,” Denise Park, chief executive of the local council, said.“We do have a higher than average number of large households – five or more people – so we’ve been looking at that. The most recent data testing shows that the majority of cases are from our south Asian heritage communities.”What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyAround a third of Blackburn with Darwen’s 148,000 population are from ethnic backgrounds, with a large Pakistani and Indian heritage population, and according to Professor Dominic Harrison, the council’s director of public health, 97 of the 114 cases recorded across the past two weeks derive from these minority groups. To help protect these communities, and prevent the situation from escalating across the region, authorities have tailored their measures accordingly, telling people they can now only accept two visitors into their homes beyond their immediate families.“With it being household transmission, we didn’t think a Leicester-styled lockdown was the right answer,” explains Ms Park. “It’s about being targeted with the action we take.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe response of Prof Harrison and his team has so far been met with positivity and optimism, on account of its specified and proactive nature. “Dominic Harrison has been absolutely on the ball with Covid-19 and he’s doing his job very well, keeping a good eye on the local community,” Gabriel Scally, a member of the Independent Sage board and professor of public health at the University of Bristol, said.“I think the council is handling it extremely well. This is the sort of approach that will work well nationally, because it’s generated by the local community, their representatives and the director of public health – trusted figures that the people can be sure they’re acting in the interest of the towns and the population.”It’s rare praise in these troubling and ided times, when the overwhelming narrative of the Covid-19 pandemic has been one of chaos and confusion. And there’s certainly hope to believe that the strategy adopted by Blackburn with Darwen proves effective.Leaning on the side of caution, authorities have announced that the current measures – which also recommend against hugs and handshakes – will be in place for four weeks before the council considers easing them. In the meantime the region’s caseload is expected to rise due to increased testing, says Ms Park, but after that it’s hoped the numbers will drop again.The story of Leicester’s lockdown – and the lessons to be learntAnd thankfully, access to data has not proved an issue, as was the case with Leicester. Ms Park said that the information provided by the local government to Prof Harrison has contained details on ethnicity, postcodes and ages, ensuring authorities have the means to develop a more comprehensive understanding of what’s going on in and around Blackburn.Additional testing units have been deployed in the local community, allowing more people who are carrying the disease but not displaying symptoms to get easily tested. “Let’s not wait till people have got symptoms,” says Ms Park. “Let’s do asymptomatic testing, do some case finding and then say to people they need to isolate.”Equally, the council has said that footways in the centre of Blackburn will be widened, to further promote social distancing, while some parking bays will be removed to help separate people queueing for takeaways and pubs. Council workers have meanwhile been visiting local religious and community centres to spread the message, and providing advice to smaller shops as to how they can protect their customers.Still, for all the encouraging work of the council, and the sense of “stoicism” that it has drawn from the local population, as Mr Marrow put its, the situation in Blackburn and Darwen has not passed by without the dangerous, racist rhetoric which marked many conversations concerning Leicester and its outbreak.“The danger is people see the data and say it’s one section of society to blame, and that is absolutely not what we’re saying,” councillor Saima Afzal said. “There are are a cocktail of factors at play here.“We are aware there are problems in the south Asian wards but I want to make it clear that they are not less or more likely to follow the rules. That’s not what my experience shows. From what I’ve seen and images I’ve been sent, there are groups gathering from a whole range of backgrounds.” She warned against analysing the statistics inaccurately as “they can be twisted any way you want to portray them”.Against this backdrop of tension, Blackburn with Darwen holds its breath as it takes another step into the unknown. Lessons have clearly been learnt from the Leicester episode, with the Lancashire council well poised to fight the virus, but there’s still a long way to go for the region.Blackburn with Darwen\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.For a town already caught in a slow and painful state of decline, the coronavirus pandemic has brought Blackburn to its knees. Decades of de-industrialisation and growing economic deprivation have left the area struggling to find its purpose – while larger, more prosperous neighbours have reinvented themselves – but the economic damage wrought by Covid-19 could prove to be the final straw.“We’ve been here for 32 long years,” said Maria Elder, the owner of Sudell Sandwiches, a small cafe in the town centre. “Lots of loyal customers over the years. We’d serve students from the college too. We even had a contract with the police to feed the officers when the football was on. That’s all gone, for now at least. We’re barely coping.”The worry for Ms Elder and other independent businesses is what a second lockdown would mean for the town. After a recent surge in cases, Blackburn finds itself walking a dangerous line. The region’s seven-day rate currently stands at 47 infections per 100,000 people and is expected to rise in the coming days.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAuthorities have already tightened restrictions this week, urging residents to limit the number of visitors to their homes and to wear face coverings in enclosed public settings, but the plunge back into full lockdown would likely drive many companies to the point of no return.“I think it’d shut us down,” said Ms Elder. “People are extremely scared and worried, because there’s a lot of places that only opened on Monday – beauticians, hairdressers. And it’s still very quiet.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safely“We’ve been here a long time, we’re an established business, but it has seriously impacted us, it really has. I’ve had to lay off one girl as a result.”Asad Jalil, who has run a dry cleaning shop in the town centre since 1989, said a second lockdown would push his business “over the edge”.“If there’s another lockdown for two or three weeks, it’s going to make it worse. People are already scared. There’s not enough money for going out, buying new stuff, people are making do with what they’ve got. “I can’t see my business returning. I doubt I’ll be here next year. Many of my usual customers are at home, working in their pyjamas. They don’t need to go into the office anymore. They don’t need to get their suits cleaned. I only came back yesterday but I don’t think it’s going to pick up again.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Although trade has been good for Anna Green and Emily Yates since they reopened their salon earlier this month, they are one of the few to have come through this period of turbulence.“In this building alone, there’s one room empty next door and upstairs there’s six empty,” Ms Green said. “They’ve had to fold. It’s not the most affluent of areas. A lot of people have packed up and gone.”The pandemic has only added to Blackburn’s problems. The local council has seen its spending power decline by nearly one-third since 2010, losing out on tens of millions of pounds, while the region has one of the lowest life-expectancy rates in the country.Some buildings in the town centre have stood empty for 10 years or more. Unwilling to take a risk on Blackburn and its struggling economy, business has been turning elsewhere in the northwest.“Blackburn was a booming town,” said Mr Jalil, the dry cleaner owner. “People used to flock here from all around, but now they don’t even bother. They either go into Bolton or Preston. There’s no footfall in Blackburn anymore.”Deprivation is also a serious and growing issue. Last year, the charity End Child Poverty revealed that half of all children in Blackburn lived in poverty, with this rate up to two-thirds in the ward of Bastwell.Nonetheless, stoicism is much in evidence. Residents are aware that everyone has a role to play in getting through the pandemic.Blackburn holds its breath after recent spike in Covid-19 cases“Everyone is putting on face masks, all our customers are taking it on board,” said Marcus Gannon, director of Hobkirk Sewing Machines, which can trace its history in the town back to 1903. “No one has got anything against it. They all appreciate it. And in a way, it gives customers who want to come in here the confidence to do so. People are just getting on with it.”Ms Elder, the cafe owner, echoed these sentiments, saying that “the majority of people are now wearing masks” and abiding by the rules – at least in public. “Everyone is taking it seriously,” she said. “I think the new restrictions are a good thing but we’ll have to see how it goes.”The council has also been working hard with small businesses to ensure they can operate under the current system. “I know some of our officers have been out and helped put the new guidance in place,” said Saima Afzal, a councillor. “Everyone has been really proactive. I think we’ve got a really resilient community in Blackburn so they are carrying on.”“My company has been here for 100 odd years,” said Mr Gannon. “I want it to be here another 100 years.

At one point, Leicester accounted for 10 per cent of all new infections in England.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut a report posted by Mr Soulsby on social media on Wednesday showed new neighbourhood data that pointed towards areas with high levels of deprivation in the inner city as the areas most affected by the virus.Local authorities received the neighbourhood data about Covid-19 testing after “asking for some weeks”, said the mayor, adding that the data shows “it is no longer possible to justify the continuation of the ‘lockdown’ across the remaining 90 per cent of the Greater Leicester area”.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyMr Soulsby told BBC Radio Leicester on Thursday morning that city officials were “finally” told which areas of Leicester were worst-affected by the coronavirus.“If only we’d had this information in advance, we’d have been able to do what they’re now doing in Blackburn, which is actually working closely with the communities and avoiding having to be locked down,” he said.“I very much regret the fact that the Government didn’t trust us with this data earlier but I think now we’ve got it, we are the ones well-placed here in the city to make sure that we use it effectively.”Officials in the city were not given Pillar 2 testing data, which highlighted the growing number of cases within the community, before the lockdown was announced, Mr Soulsby told The Independent earlier this week.The government will decide later today whether to make changes to the lockdown after examining 14 days of coronavirus data, with health secretary Matt Hancock saying a public announcement will be made “as soon as is reasonably possible”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The coronavirus pandemic has taken a toll on the health of the nation’s relationships, according to research which suggests bonds between couples, friends and colleagues have all been strained by the UK’s lockdown.One-fifth of people feel friendships with others outside of their household suffered in the last four months as social distancing kept people apart, UCL’s Covid-19 social study found.But the lockdown seems also to have impacted on those who live together, with 20 per cent of respondents saying friendships with their housemates were now worse. Couples fared little better, with 18 per cent reporting their relationship with their partner had suffered since March.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRelations between co-workers deteriorated the most as many UK workplaces adjusted to remote working and video conference calls. One-quarter of people surveyed for the non-peer reviewed observational study said they were getting on worse with colleagues since the start of lockdown.“Our study shows that lockdown measures are having a significant toll on people’s relationships, both with people locked down together and those who have been unable to see each other over the lockdown period, said Dr Daisy Fancourt, a professor of psychobiology and epidemiology at UCL.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyShe added: “This is especially true of people with diagnosed mental health issues and younger adults, as well as those with lower household incomes, key workers, those living along and those living with children, all of whom may be facing greater financial or mental pressures which have been exacerbated during the lockdown period.”Worsening relationships were most common among younger adults. Of the 12 per cent of people who reported the breakdown of a relationship, most were aged under 30 and the fewest were over 60.However, researchers found relationships between neighbours had improved since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly among people aged between 30 and 59.  Cheryl Lloyd, head of education at the Nuffield Foundation, which is funding the ongoing study, said the finding “suggests a resurgence in community spirit” during the pandemic.But she added it was “cause for concern that the survey also show that people who are more vulnerable - those on lower household incomes and those with diagnosed mental health issues - are more likely to report worsening friendships and relationships during lockdown”.Launched the week before the UK entered lockdown on 23 March, the UCL study is the largest into the UK public’s attitudes, health and wellbeing during the coronavirus pandemic.Researchers found complete compliance with lockdown measures continued to fall over the past fortnight, particularly among young adults. But 90 per cent of all adults and 80 per cent of under-30s said they were still complying with most rules.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To start with, he will make 36,000 face coverings a week, but the size and scope of the factory means he will be able to scale up production and make up to 500 million coverings annually.The coverings are disposable and made up of three-ply non-woven plastic material – meaning they are water resistant and can be worn for up to 24 hours. He will sell the coverings from his website – they will cost £3.79 for 10, or £2.99 if consumers subscribe for weekly deliveries.On donating thousands to The Felix Project, the teenager said: “I want to support those who are helping others in this crisis.” Mark Curtin, of The Felix Project, said: “These Signature Masks will help protect volunteers and staff in our food redistribution warehouses.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.After two long weeks under lockdown, there is to be no respite for some of Leicester – not just yet. Another fortnight of restrictions beckons for the city and its people. Beyond that, who knows what lies in store for this corner of the country.“I’m fed up, really fed up,” says Sylvia Beynon, a resident of Oadby. The borough, along with Wigston and Leicester itself, is set to remain in lockdown due to its high incidence of cases – yet neighbouring areas have been given the green light to finally lift certain measures from 24 July.“It’s not fair, it really isn’t. I’m just so upset and angry,” adds Ms Beynon. “I think we’re being hung out to dry. We’re all doing exactly what we’re supposed to do. We’re getting the tests, we’re following the rules, we’re doing what’s been asked of us. People’s patience is starting to run thin.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAgainst mounting anger on the ground, the government has made its position and approach clear. Addressing the House of Commons on Thursday, health secretary Matt Hancock said the continuation of the lockdown was “vital for the health of everyone in Leicester”.The latest figures indicate that the virus certainly hasn’t subsided within the city. According to Mr Hancock, the current seven-day infection rate now stands at 119 cases per 100,000 people – down from 135 when the prolonged lockdown was first announced. Progress, but as Mr Hancock added, there is “still a lot to do”.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyThere are some small comforts to look forward to, though. From 24 July, restrictions on some non-essential shops and early years childcare will be lifted, while those outside of the reduced lockdown boundary will be allowed to enjoy the freedoms currently available to the rest of the country.But for those caught inside the city’s hotspots, there’s no suggestion yet as to when restaurants, pubs and bars will reopen, leaving Leicester’s hospitality sector vulnerable to further economic damage and decay.“Many small businesses in Leicester are going to struggle to survive during this additional period of lockdown they certainly need additional help from the government,” Nigel Porter, the city’s only Liberal Democrat councillor, tells The Independent.However, he stressed that “putting the economy ahead of health” risked endangering the local population. “At the end of the day the priority has to be to get on top of the virus and until the number of positive cases in Leicester starts to drop the city will remain in lockdown.”While other local leaders have accepted that the city “cannot return to business as usual”, as Leicester East MP Claudia Webbe wrote on Twitter, Sir Peter Soulsby held few punches in his response to the government’s latest announcement.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They have left two areas in there – one that has a Liberal Democrat council, the other that has a Labour mayor.“The fact is they have focused in a way that is clearly party political and that’s not a way to deal with the virus.”The mayor’s comments have been met with a mixed reaction among locals, but they nonetheless point to a fraying relationship between Whitehall and Leicester City Council.Of course, Sir Peter is not alone in his criticism of the government. Kamlesh Khunti, a member of the Independent Sage board and a professor of vascular medicine at the University of Leicester, told The Independent that even now, after weeks of awareness around the city’s issues, local public health authorities are “still not getting data quickly enough”.“Local teams need to be more involved too,” he says. “This needs to be all localised. We know all the networks, the shopkeepers, the faith centres, we know the business community. These are the people who can influence what happens.“It has been a complete shock to us. We’re a proud city and this has not been good for anyone here. It’s not good for the community, for our businesses or our universities.”He said that although he was saddened by Thursday’s news, he was not necessarily surprised, explaining that an increase in targeted testing across the city’s most infected areas would be reflected in the statistics.“We will identify more patients if we continue doing more tests, especially in this high risk population. Worryingly this strategy may continue our city having high rates for quite a few weeks with disastrous consequences.“The high rates are not because people aren’t socially distancing - they’re all doing that has been asked of them over the last few weeks. This is why our local people are shocked, frustrated and angry.”Understandably, the continuation of lockdown is proving a tough pill to swallow for Leicester – especially compared to the soft-touch approach adopted by authorities in Blackburn with Darwen, where residents have been urged to limit the number of visitors to their homes and to wear face coverings in enclosed public settings after a recent spike in cases.“We were never given that opportunity,” says Jon Porter, a resident in Wigston, which has reported the second highest number of infections across all of Leicestershire.“Why wasn’t Leicester given that opportunity? Why weren’t we warned early on that Leicester is struggling? That was when we should have acted and introduce localised measures, like Blackburn. We weren’t told and now it’s too late.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.The team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Our social care system relies on many overseas workers, we should be welcoming them in not shutting them out.The new plans, promised for years since Britain voted to leave the EU back in , will see freedom of movement scrapped in favour of an Australian-style points-based scheme.Under the new system, foreign nationals applying to come to the UK for work purposes will have to meet certain criteria.It will assign points for specic skills, qualications, salaries or professions, and visas will only be awarded to those who gain enough points.The minimum requirements will include having a job offer from an approved sponsor that suits their skill level and being able to speak English. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Foreign nationals wishing to come to the UK for work purposes will need to score  points to successfully apply for an online “e-visa”.If an applicant meets the criteria of the minimum requirements, they will be awarded  points.But to score above this threshold they will have to meet other criteria based on salary, seeking to work in a sector with a recognised labour shortage or a having a PhD.While most will be expected to earn a minimum of £, a year, some such as lab technicians with prized skills will be able to come in with a salary as low as £,.To score  points, foreign nationals will need to be able to prove they have a job offer from an approved sponsor that is appropriate to their skill level.A further  points will be scoredthe job is in an occupation with a labour shortage such as engineering or information technology.While a university doctorate gives ten points with the figure rising to  pointsthe qualication is in science, technology, engineering or mathematics.Ten points will be awarded for an annual salary of £,, rising to  points over £,.A builders labourer who cannot speak English but has been offered a salary of £,, for instance, would only score  points and would be blocked from coming to the UK to work.Likewise, a skilled plumber with good English on £,-a -year, would also be awarded  points but denied access.But a primary school teacher offered an annual salary of £,, who also speaks good English, would score  points and would secure a visa to work in the UK.A university lecturer with a maths PhD with an offer of a £, would be awarded  points and would also secure a visa.It follows the points systems used in Australia and New Zealand.Ms Patel also announced the beefed-up measures for Border Force and immigration officials today.The Government revealed even criminals not sentenced to  months face being booted out of Britain.It said: Those already in the UK who are sentenced to  months or more in prison must be considered for deportation.Where the -month criminality deportation threshold is not met, a foreign criminal will still be considered for deportation where it is conducive to the public good, including where they have serious or persistent criminality.The change means criminals from the European Union are treated the same as currently happens to those from non-EU countries.Anyone deemed as a skilled worker - including postgraduate students - will still have the right to bring their families and children to the UK.Spouses, partners and children under  will still be eligible to come to the UK and stay.They can also have near full access to the UKs jobs market, and will be able to attend schools here.However, they will be made to pay the health surcharge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It has no place anywhere. It is often a breach of human rights. It is often illegal.So it is understandable that many of us are questioning why this is happening – and, by extension, what our role is in this.Has our desire for cheap and cheerful fashion created this sickening practice  Are we somehow to blame for insisting we will only pay as little as possible for everything Should we — as some smarmy “influencers” suggest — be boycotting anyone who sells cheap clothes The simple answer is: NoOf course, in an ideal world, we’d all be buying top quality, ethically sourced garments that last a letime.But that’s just not going to happen. Most people just can’t afford to. And we like to keep up with trends while at the same time paying the bills. There is nothing wrong with that.Our love of fashion keeps the economy going.Fashion is the UK’s largest creative industry. It provides jobs for almost as many people as the financial sector and is one of the most female-dominated industries in the world.Around , people work in the UK fashion industry and approximately  per cent of garment workers are women.Livelihoods are at stakewe decide to boycott fashion brands because of their bad practices.The answer is for fast fashion firms like Boohoo and Quiz to do the work and get their houses in order. This is on them.And big firms like Boohoo — a business worth £.billion — are not without means. They have the resources to make changes.They need to perform due diligence on who is making their clothes — they must forensically examine the whole supply chain, from contractors to sub-contractors and anyone  who has a hand in how this stuff comes to market.Decent wages must be the norm. They must be transparent and tell us, the consumer, what they know.This is not rocket science. It is already happening.The Fashion Transparency Index  ranks  of the biggest global fashion brands according to how much information they provide about their suppliers, supply chain policies and practices and social and environmental impact.Retailers are scored on their transparency across five key areas: Policy and commitments, governance, traceability, supplier assessment and remediation and spotlight issues.HM, one of the largest fashion retailers in the world, is currently top of The Fashion Transparency Index.Stung by allegations that its clothes had been made by child labour in Myanmar — with some paid as little as p an hour — it last year built a new tracking system so consumers can find out where each garment is made.Marks  Spencer also scored highly. It introduced an ethical trading programme including audits of its supply chain in the Nineties.Eleven more brands in the Fashion Index revealed details of their processing facilities — where finishing, dyeing and laundering take place — in  compared to .And ten brands disclosed their raw material suppliers in , compared with just one in .Of course this isn’t just a fast fashion problem. It is industry-wide.What customers need from all brands is transparency, as this leads to accountability and ultimately change.Soyou do want to spend your hard-earned cash on fast fashion, only shop at places where you know they are doing their bit to ensure things are more ethically sourced.AS much as I love new clothes, fast fashion has had its day.Two brands have recently been at the centre of allegations that garments are being made or packed in dire working conditions in Leicester.Boohoo has paid a heavy price for these claims, with more than a billion pounds wiped off the value of its shares.Today, it suffered another big fall after a leading investor sold out on ethical grounds.And rival Quiz was sucked into the growing storm. It has suspended a supplier after claims that a factory in Leicester offered a worker just £ an hour to make its clothes.Quiz admitted that the situation, which it is investigating, is “unacceptable”.As online retailers specialising in casualwear, these companies were riding high after lockdown boosted sales. Following these allegations, the tide is turning against them.It comes after lockdown prompted many of us to reassess our lives, with the desire to be greener high on the agenda.A recent survey showed that more women were willing to make do and mend. That can’t be a bad thing.A common reason that clothes are sent to landfill is a missing button, which is simply appalling.Before buying a new dress or jacket, I now ask myself, ‘Am I going to wear this item for years ’Fashion is a global industry worth more than £trillion a year. It will clean itself up where necessary and adapt.Boohoo and Quiz have been swt to terminate relationships with rogue suppliers. Elsewhere, there is much talk of “respons-ible” and “sustainable” fashion.Don’t be surprisedthe fast fashion pack gives itself a long overdue makeover. Hopefully it will be more than the latest fad.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Scotland’s government has had to be propped up every step of the way by Westminster.Sturgeon is a good TV performer, I’ll give her that.She’s adored by the international media in the same way New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern is.

Of course, whatever the cost becomes, it is less than the cost of the threat to our national security and is a price we must pay. We were warned repeatedly by all of our allies about involving Huawei in our communications network.In recent years, I have heard first-hand from each of our intelligence-sharing partners in the so-called “Five Eyes” network . All of these countries, our closest allies, have been deeply worried by Britain’s decision. All have warned that this country — and our relationships with our allies — would be compromisedwe allowed Huawei such access. We would have been vulnerable, they warned.Bizarrely, Theresa May ignored this advice, then Boris Johnson’s government originally went further down this terrible road.This, despite the fact that other companies — including US firms — could have provided just the same technology, without the same security risks.And, key sources tell me, all for the same price. Still the Government snubbed our allies, alarmed our friends, and stuck to their decision.Privately it was briefed out that our own security services were confident of their ability to get backdoor access to see what Huawei would be doing and to control any covert activity.

The first is an obvious change in relations towards China that is going on around the world. Covid- has played a part. China — unwittingly or carelessly — gave the world a virus which has all but halted our economies.The CCP’s lies and cover-ups during this devastating period have meant that all of us have been confined to our houses for months — and not just those who have contracted the coronavirus that came from Wuhan.In the months and years ahead, all of us will be poorer because of the CCP’s lies. The state has disappeared its own scientists. It allowed travel even after it knew what it was dealing with. It lied about the nature of the virus.And other members of the Five Eyes network have suggested that the evidence points clearly to the virus having been created in a Chinese laboratory.President Trump and his Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, have rightly made an issue of this. Both have been warning for years about the instability of China as a partner. As recent events in Hong Kong should remind us, China is a one-party, totalitarian state. It rules by dictatorship and terror. Of course, it is also highly technologically skilled and financially ever more dominant.The CCP seeks to make China the world’s leading power. Washington is — rightly — determined to stop that. And this country —we value freedom and the rule of law, as we always have — should seek to stop that too.This means, among much , denying China and Chinese state companies from extending their grip in countries like ours.For years, Chinese companies have stolen information, ripped off s, and otherwise acted completely unlawfully. They have engaged in espionage and information theft on an industrial scale.Some people might look at yesterday’s decision and think it a small, technical matter. It isn’t.Not only is it a decision with far-reaching consequences for this country’s security. It is also a signal of which side this country will be on in one of the most important tussles of our day.Everywhere China seeks to extend its power is an area where freedom recedes.Yesterday was a bad day for Huawei, a good day for Britain and a great day for freedom.Q: WHAT is the new ruling on Huawei A: From the end of this year, telecoms firms will not be able to buy any new Huawei hardware, such as antennas, to put into their G networks. By the end of , all Huawei equipment must be stripped out of the UK’s G networks.Q: Why is G important A: It will be ten times faster than G and allow more complicated technology, such as driverless cars, to operate.Q: What is Huawei currently used for A: The firm is the leading provider of technology needed to operate wireless networks that provide the G signal on our mobile phones. They were going to be used for “non-core” equipment in the G network. Instead European firms Nokia or Erion are likely to provide the hardware.Q: Can I still use my Huawei mobile phone A: Yes. There is no plan to ban its handsets.Q: Will the ban affect my phone signal A: Some telecom firms have warned that stripping out all Huawei hardware too quickly could result in a temporary loss of signal in some places, but other experts say this concern has been exaggerated.Q: Does this affect full fibre broadband connections A: Not at the moment. The Government’s security advisers have only recommended “transitioning away” from Huawei when it comes to fibre networks.Q: Will I have to replace a Huawei router in my home A: The router is not part of the G infrastructure and won’t be affected.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If you say it, produce the facts”.Today, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the alleged interference unacceptable.He said: The Government has concluded that it is almost certain that Russian actors sought to interfere in the  General Election through the online amplication of illicitly acquired and leaked Government documents.Sensitive Government documents relating to the UK-US Free Trade Agreement were illicitly acquired before the  General Election and disseminated online via the social media  Reddit. When these gained no traction, further attempts were made to promote the illicitly acquired material online in the run up to the General Election.Whilst there is no evidence of a broad spectrum Russian campaign against the General Election, any attempt to interfere in our democratic processes is completely unacceptable.

Addressing the Common’s Science and Technology Committee, he said other Government advisers shared his concerns. Sir Patrick said: “My view on this and I think this is a view shared by SAGE, is that were still at a time when distancing measures are important.“And of the ious distancing measures, working from home for many companies remains a perfectly good option because its easy to do.WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR:“A number of companies think its actually not detrimental to productivity, and in that situation, there’s absolutely no reason I can see to change it.”But Sir Patrick was not finished there. He also delivered a scathing assessment on the timing of the UKs lockdown and Number s overall handling of the deadly pandemic.He said lockdown measures should have been in place a week earlier while the outcome of the coronavirus “has not been good for the UK.”Mr Johnson enforced the countrys lockdown restrictions on March . The respiratory disease has so far killed more than , Britons this year.This comes as the PM is poised to rip-up the work-from-home guidance tomorrow - giving bosses the green light to welcome staff back to the office.He is planning to hold a Downing Street press conference to tell millions of Brits that it will be safe toto the office next month.The PM is expected to appear alongside the Test and Trace chief Baroness Dido Harding to unveil a new Contain Framework designed to prove to anxious workers that the virus is “under control” in their local areas.The pair will also flesh out the Government’s ‘whack-a-mole’ strategy spelling out extra measures to stop outbreaks over the coming months - which they hope will give people the reassurance they need to venture back to the office and onto buses and trains.The move will finally end the blanket work-from-home policy that has seen the vast majority of Brits shut out of the office for more than four months.Today, the UK announced a further  deaths related to Covid- which takes the daily average number of fatalities to its lowest level since March.In Scotland, one person died, ending a seven-day record of no fatalities.Since the start of the pandemic, , people have tragically died in Britain due to the disease.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They share a year-old chihuahua called Luna, which Anne-Sophie is believed to have kept in the split.A source close to the DJ said: “Roman loved Soph and things had been going really well for them. But being in lockdown is tough for any couple and they just weren’t able to make things work, which has been upsetting and tough for them both.“His pals have encouraged him to move on and have got him on Raya, which is packed with attractive and creative women. He’s set up a profile with his best photos and has set the music on his page to the song Gold, by his dad’s band. He’s having fun with it.”Roman’s career has gone from strength to strength in the past year, having finished third in the TV jungle, landed an ITV talk show with his pop star dad and become a regular on Celebrity Gogglebox.But in December he was hoping to start a family and thought Anne-Sophie was the girl he would do it with.He said at the time: “Every time I see a child, I get broody.”Plenty more fish in the sea, Roman.DESPITE not ­seeing each other for four months, The Pussycat Dolls are now closer than ever, according to Carmit Bachar.The singer, who posed in a patterned bikini and floral blue shirt for the cover of Lapalme magazine, said of bandmates Nicole Scherzinger, Kimberly Wyatt, Ashley Roberts and Jessica Sutta that absence really has made the heart grow fonder.Carmit explained: “We’ve been going through similar things. It’s more important than ever now to show that women can support each other and hold each other up.”But there is one person for whom Gemma will always open her purse – her mum Joan.The reality star, left, said: “I like to treat her. I am massively independent and I do like to pay my own way.” Thinking out loud on her BBC Radio  podcast, Gemma mused: “Could we ever get rid of money “I don’t think we could. What would we replace it with “I quite like chocolate buttons, so I’d be happy to replace it.”Might get a bit messy in the summer, Gem.THEY say birds of a feather stick together and it seems models do too – as Cara Delevingne and Kaia Gerber look inseparable at a Black Lives Matter rally.Kaia wrapped her arms around Cara, and strolled with her, as they listened to motivational speakers at the event in Calornia, which was attended by thousands.Despite the nine-year age gap, the pair palled up after meeting on the fashion circuit. Cara, who spent lockdown in the US, joined American Kaia, her model mum Cindy Crawford and dad Randy Gerber in a social bubble when restrictions relaxed last month.This included joining the family for dinner at swanky Malibu restaurant Nobu in June, with Cara having split from her long-term girlfriend, Pretty Little Liars actress Ashley Benson, the previous month.With Kaia quickly becoming the model of the moment, I couldn’t think of a better pal than Cara – named the UK’s highest-earning catwalk queen last year – to help her navigate the industry.I can reveal she is dating rapper Jonathan Kabamba, who she posted this photo of on Instagram yesterday.She captioned it: “My Love, my King. Thank you for all the light, strength and joy you have brought into my le. I feel capable of anything with you by my side.”The pair are believed to have been dating since last year.Jonathan, who hails from the Congo, is the first man she has publicly dated after splitting from rapper HYPO in .Before that she was married to scientist Adam Gouraguine but they split after ten years, just a year after tying the knot.Jonathan headed up a community centre with recording studio in Chad-well Heath, North London, to give kids skills to stay out of gangs. It shut in February after two years.Hopefully he and Emeli last far longer than that.BOYZONE split up for good before the release of their  album and the subsequent tour last year . . . or so they said. But they might already be having second thoughts.Keith Duffy has teamed up with ex-Westle star Brian McFadden to release an album as Boyz-Le, and Brian reckons it’s only a matter of time before Boyzone are back too. He said: “It’s  years since I left Westle so, for me, rejoining won’t happen. But for Boyzone . . . the boys have been together for  years.“Though Keith and I are doing this and Ronan Keating is doing his solo thing,the opportunity comes up for the boys to get together – there is going to be a -year anniversary in a few years – you can never say never.”With  No singles between the two bands, Keith and Brian had plenty of options when picking songs for their Strings Attached album, recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, which is out today.Keith said: “It made it very easy, the fact we had so many No singles to choose from. You Needed Mewas always our first choice, the song we were both excited about.” And they are already writing new material.Keith said: “With lockdown, we’re miles ahead where we were hoping to be for the new album.“Boyz-le has gone from strength to strength. We’ve moved mountains.“We’re pinching ourselves to be given this opportunity again in our ­forties to get on stage.”POP fans would have been in for a shockthey had bumped into this trio in the park.THE Saturdays members Frankie Bridge, Una Healy and Mollie King shared the photo on their catch-up, six years on from their split.I guess their absent bandmates Vanessa White and Rochelle Humes were taking their social- distancing really seriously.MEGAN THEE STALLION is “grateful to be alive” after being shot in the foot at a party at the weekend. The rapper, who collaborated with Beyonce on a remix of her song Savage, said she was taken to hospital by police, where she had an op to remove the bullets after the “traumatic” incident.CONGRATS to Radio  DJ Chris Stark, who has become a dad for a second time.

I am not going to try and cause any rts between me and my brother.I’m very uncomfortable with the whole situation. I’m in between a rock and a hard place. I have my own opinions. I dont want to offend anyone.He added: I’m not very close with my brother’s we - I’ve met Shamima, but only at family s. There’s a big age dference between me and her anyway. That’s it.I have sympathy for her family. It’s a tough thing for a family to lose a child, but thats as far as I’ll go.I only found out she went to Syria on the news. I didn’t even know. They didn’t broach it with me. You take the hint.Senior judges said today Begum, who left aged , should be allowed toto the UK to challenge being denied her British citizenship.It is a bitter blow for the government who revoked her citizenship last year - sparking an appeal which has cost taxpayers more than £, so far.Begum and two pals – Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase – ran away to Syria in February .Begum used her elder sister’s passport to flee with her Bethnal Green Academy friends.The trio flew to Turkey and then crossed the border into Syria with the aid of smugglers.Within weeks of arriving, Shamima was married to Isis jihadi Yago Riedijk, , from Holland.They had two children who died from malnutrition and disease.The couple were separated as they fled Baghouz, the village where a few hundred Isis fighters were holed up in a desperate last stand.Shamima ended up in a Kurdish refugee camp where she gave birth to her third child.Eldest sister Renu revealed that her family had lost contact with her for the “longest time” until she was found by a Times journalist.One source said today: Why should anyone who leaves the UK to join IS then complain when they have their British passport taken away Shamima Begum made a conscious choice to go to a terrorist warzone, where she has now been stranded. Shes not able to appeal her case in person as a direct result. Many people will rightly ask, Wheres the unfairness in that But Lord Justice Flaux - sitting with Lady Justice King and Lord Justice Singh - said: Fairness and justice must, on the facts of this case, outweigh the national security concerns, so that the leave to enter appeals should be allowed.The Court of Appeal ruled: The only way in which she can have a fair and effective appeal is to be permitted to come into the United Kingdom to pursue her appeal.Begum was one of three east London schoolgirls who travelled to Syria in  to join ISIS.After marrying an ISIS fighter and sewing terrorists into suicide vests, she was found pregnant more than three years later in a Syrian refugee camp - her baby boy died not long after being born.Figures show her lawyers have claimed £, in legal aid trying to win back her UK citizenship - but sources say the true public bill is at least double and tops £,.When she was discovered and stripped of her citizenship, her own dad slammed her choice to run away to join the terror group.Ahmed Ali said he was on the side of the government and condemned her lack of remorse before claiming he was misquoted.Now that she is able to leave the camp in Syria andto the UK to launch her appeal, it is likely the Government would struggle to send Begum back to a war-torn country - evenshe fails to get citizenship back.Sajid Javid warned: Most critically, allowing her and indeed other terrorists back into the UK to pursue an appeal would create a real security risk that cannot be fully mitigated, even with the ersion of signicant resources.If Ms Begum does come to this country it will prove impossible to remove her.Following the ruling a Home Office spokesperson said: “This is a very disappointing decision by the Court. We will now apply for permission to appeal this judgement, and to stay its effects pending any onward appeal.“The Government’s top priority remains maintaining our national security and keeping the public safe.”Lord Justice Flaux ruled the national security concerns about her could be addressed and managedshe s to the United Kingdom.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The crucial thing is that they are immune.The Oxford Uni study suggests the epidemiological limit to reach herd immunity may be greatly reduceda fraction of the population is unable to transmit the virus.This is feasible, they add,people have inbuilt resistance or cross-protection from exposure to seasonal coronaviruses.The report says: Signicant reductions in expected mortality can also be seen in settings where a fraction of the population is resistant to infection.Results suggest that sufficient herd-immunity may already be in place to substantially mitigate a potential second wave, the researchers add.It has been evident from the outset that the risk of severe disease and death from Covid- is not unormly distributed across all age classes.The bulk of deaths among the over  million cases reported worldwide are occurring among older age classes and those with [pre-existing conditions].“It is further becoming clear that risk of infection is also not unormly distributed across the population, the reports says.Scientists at Oxford point to those managing to fend off the virus as having high ing immunity.And,antibodies to the disease are built up in - per cent of the population, this is entirely compatible with local levels of immunity having approached or even exceeded the herd immunity threshold.In which case the risk and scale of resurgence is lower than currently perceived, say the researchers.Immunity to the bug has been hitting headlines for months, with Kings College research saying antibody responses to the killer bug “can be detected in most infected iniduals - days following the onset of Covid- symptoms”.It investigated samples from  coronavirus patients,  days after they had been diagnosed with Covid-.Worryingly, Kings Colleges study found that immunity to fight coronavirus might disappear only three months after infection.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

These areas also heavily voted Leave in the EU referendum.Many of the districts have unusually high levels of furloughed workers, raising the prospect that they could also be hardest hit by the coronavirus recession.

And those measures introduced on the fourth of July will also not apply, he added.However, most schools in Leicester have already broken up for the summer break.The measures would be reviewed again in two weeks to seemore progress has been made, and more rules can be relaxed.He also confirmed that some types of coronavirus swab tests would stop being used for the meantime as the Government assesses their safety.Some were not up to the usual high standards, the health secretary says - but stressed that there is no evidence of harm or impact on test results.The Health Secretary said: I hope these careful easing of restrictions will provide some comfort to the people of Leicester and Leciestershire.I say this directly to the people... I pay tribute to you. You have all shown respect for one another.I understand this hasnt been easy.There is still a lot to do and the public health messages remain critical.Please do not lose your resolve. The sooner we get this virus under control, the sooner we can restore le in Leicester.The city was the first in the UK to be put back into lockdown last month after a spike in cases.Testing centres swooped on the city and people were encouraged to stay home. Shops were shut up again and pubs and restaurants did not open on July  as in the rest of the country.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said today: As this data confirms, coronavirus cases in Leicester were signicantly higher than other parts of the country – and we took clear and decisive action to save lives.“We are working closely with the local authorities to ensure that these measures are only in place as long as is necessary, and we will set out the next steps by  July.”The Government has stressed that data has been provided to the Directors of Public Health throughout the incident.The lockdown currently covers the city of Leicester as well as surrounding areas including Birstall, Beaumont Leys, Glenfield and South Wigston. It has been suggested that families living in closer quarters, combined with a higher population of people whose English is a second language, may have contributed to the spike in cases.Workers in cramped clothing factories have also been blamed, with Police and the National Crime Agency investigating possible links to modern slavery.But Sir Peter told Sky News there is no evidence whatsoever to show coronavirus was being transmitted in clothing factories.Theres nothing in the data that suggests it is transmitting in places of work, he said.Mr Hancock revealed flare-ups are being swtly and silently dealt with.He said more than  local actions are being taken across the country each week.Professor Jonathan Van-Tam told the BBC that data published on Saturday showed the city is really quite an outlier compared with anywhere  in the country.Mr Van-Tam told the BBC: The situation has improved but it needs to go further.He said that, while it would not be his decision to end the lockdown, doing so cant be rushed.Pressed on whether Leicesters lockdown is likely to be lted, Mr Van-Tam said: With any of these things, usually the way that one approaches them from a public health perspective is to take a phased approach.Normally you dont just go from having the brakes on heavily to just taking the brakes off completely.I think thats a reasonable expectation to set.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Today’s government claim is an attempt to ert attention from the threat to the NHS and the Tory party links to Russian oligarchs expected to be revealed in the long-buried parliamentary Russia report.The former Labour boss refused to answer questions from journalists outside his home in North London this afternoon.Mr Corbyn was asked by a journalist: Mr Corbyn, Do you have anything to say about Russian disruption  Were you complicit Did you help those who attacked our election, Mr Corbyn Mr Corbyn then shut the gate and said: Goodbye.The reporter continued: Do you have anything to say at all, Mr Corbyn, about whats happened today Do you regret whats happened Are you complicit with Russian interference in our elections, Mr Corbyn Would you do it again, Mr Corbyn Do you have anything to add about what happened, Mr Corbyn Do you regret your actions, Mr Corbyn, do you regret taking that document The ex-Labour leader then shut the door after wheeling his bike inside, followed with another goodbye to the reporter.The Government said today:The dossier of leaked minutes from trade talks, which Mr Corbyn claimed was evidence Boris Johnson would sell the NHS to Donald Trump, was ripped off the website.Analysts at the time claimed the papers, waved by Mr Corbyn at an election rally, bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign called Secondary Infektion.Mr Corbyn has been repeatedly accused of being soft on Russia, even refusing to blame them for the Salisbury Novichok attack.The ousted hard left Labour leader would only go as far as saying “the evidence points strongly” to the Kremlin.In March last year Mr Corbyn sparked a furious backlash after warning Theresa May against “rushing way ahead of the evidence” on Salisbury.His spokesman at the time said memories of the Iraqi “dodgy” dossier meant it was “problematic” to accept the Government’s position.Labour today distanced themselves from Russia.A spokesman said: “We condemn any attempt by Russia..to interfere in our country’s democratic processes.Labour stands ready to work cross-party to protect our nation’s security.A senior Russian politician said today that allegations that Russia tried to meddle in the  General Election are anti-Russian nonsense which undermine UK-Russia relations and the UKs own authority.The Russian Foreign Ministry added: “The statement is so foggy and contradictory that it is almost impossible to understand it.If it’s inappropriate to say something then dont say it. If you say it, produce the facts”.The online forum Reddit confirmed the leak was linked to the Kremlin in December last year.It came as Vladimir Putins Russia was today blamed for being behind repeated cyber attacks to try and steal a coronavirus vaccine from Britain.The UK has been able to point the finger at Russia for the very first time in explosive claims President Putin knew about attacks on Britains coronavirus vaccine project.A joint operation with the US and Canada has uncovered a malicious campaign to steal information uncovered by Britains top scientists on coronavirus with targeted attacks since March.No said today they believe the attacks came from a group known at APT - part of the Russian intelligence service.The clandestine group of hackers is also known as “the Dukes” or “Cozy Bear”.The PMs official spokesman said today: The attacks which are taking place against scientists and others doing vital work to combat coronavirus are despicable.Working with our allies, we will call out those who seek to do us harm in cyber space and hold them to account.Heres what we know about the attacks:The National Cyber Security Centre have thrown every protection they have at Britains vaccination projects to keep them safe from attempts to steal information.British research projects are at the forefront of the effort to find a vaccine with scientists at Oxford University and Imperial University London leading the charge to prevent thousands more from dying.Britain is expected to publish a long-delayed report into Russian influence in British politics next week.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The firm has donated a total of £, to the party since April , according to the Electoral Commission. The most recent donation, of £, was made to the party in September . The firm has also employed Owen Paterson, a Tory MP and former minister, as an advisor since , and is paid £, a year. The Mirror understands red flags were raised about the aposCEapos safety stamps on the Chinese-made tests supplied by Randox. Physical inspection of the tests led to questions about the sterility of the swabs. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Clinical advice is that thereaposs no evidence of any harm, the test results are not affected, there is no evidence of any issues with our other test swabs and there is no impact on access to testing. In a statement issued yesterday, the Department of Health said: “As a precautionary measure and while we investigate further, NHS Test and Trace are requesting that all settings pause the use of Randox test kits with immediate effect and until further notice.” Randox, which described its system as part of the “cornerstone of Government testing across the UK”, was awarded the contract in May as the Government was racing to meet its target of , tests per day. Grilling Mr Hancock in the House of Commons on Thursday evening, shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth questioned the awarding of the contract which he said was “given to Randox without any competitive tender”.  The firm, based in County Antrim, posted on its website in June: “Our test was adopted by the NHS and Public Health England and forms the cornerstone of Government testing across the UK. Using the Randox-patented Biochip Array Technology, the most-comprehensive multiplex PCR  on the market.” As a result of the recall of the kits, a number of testing sites have also been forced to suspend all activity until further notice. This afternoon Wirral Council announced that it had closed down the Bidston Coronavirus Testing Site near Birkenhead “for precautionary reasons, due to a safety recall issued by the Government on Randox test kits”. The Department for Health and Social Care said there wasnapost enough time to perform a full procurement contest because of the short notice in ramping up coronavirus testing.A spokesperson said:   “The speed at which we have increased our testing capacity is unprecedented and a real success made possible by teamwork between the Government and key partners.“In a matter of weeks we have engineered the largest ever expansion of British diagnostic capability - scaling up a nationwide network of drive-in testing sites, introducing home testing, deploying mobile testing units operated by Armed Forces personnel, building three new ‘mega labs’ to analyse test samples, and more than doubling the capacity of the NHS and Public Health England laboratories.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lightning lockdowns councils set new","story":"NewsLightning lockdowns: Councils set for new shut down powers in event of outbreaksBoris Johnsons updated road map for re-opening Britain is set to include new lightning lockdown powers for councils which will help them in shutting down pubs and gatheringsShareCommentsByRyan Merrield:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video vallance-no-good-reason-end-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics lightning-lockdowns-councils-set-new-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

It could also mean bans on weddings and other large gatherings at short notice.A Government health source told The Sun: Councils will be able to impose lighting lockdowns where they see fit.Boris Johnson is set update his road map to help Britain bounce back from the pandemic at a Downing Street press conference on Friday.For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  As well as the powers for councils, the PM is set commit to a new target of reaching the capacity for , coronavirus tests a day by November. The NHS will be granted an extra £ billion in funding to prepare for a second wave. In the wake of a dire warning of the consequences of Covid- rebounding, No said the funding will allow extra hospital capacity while allowing routine treatments and procedures to continue.  The funding for the NHS in England will allow private hospital capacity to be used and for Nightingale hospitals to be maintained until the end of March. It comes after a report commissioned by the Governmentaposs chief scientic adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, warned there could be , hospital deaths in a reasonable worst-case scenario. Winter always places a great strain on the health service, but there are concerns a resurgence of the virus during the annual flu season could be crippling.  A Government spokesperson said the NHS must be battle ready for winter. Tomorrow, he will set out a broad package of measures to protect against both a possible second wave, and to ease winter pressures and keep the public safe. The spokesman said the immediate funding for England was new and not previously allocated, while expenditure will be set out for the devolved nations in due course. NHS Providers, which represents NHS organisations, deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery has called for urgent clarity over what the funding will cover.  She said funding is already in place for the Nightingale hospitals and private beds, while social care is in a critical condition but the Government is yet to afford it any extra money. The British Medical Association also called for details on how the money will be used. Earlier this week Mr Johnson was warned in the report by the Academy of Medical Sciences that action must be taken now to mitigate the potential for a second peak, including scaling up the Test and Trace system.  The research said capacity for , tests per day will be needed to test iniduals as they show symptoms of either Covid- or flu. The latest Government figures say capacity stood at nearly ,, but Mr Johnson will commit to increase this to half a million by the end of October to bolster Test and Trace. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has already announced plans for the biggest flu vaccination programme in history, with eligibility for free injections likely to be extended. Non-urgent operations were suspended to free up hospital beds as the UK was plunged into a lockdown during the first wave. But Downing Street says the new plans to be announced by the PM will allow them to go ahead where possible as ministers target efforts on local lockdowns.

Vladimir Putin’s spies want to steal secrets so Moscow can produce a jab. A GCHQ chief said: “We condemn these despicable attacks.”Britain is fighting off an alleged campaign by Moscow to steal information in a bid to develop a coronavirus vaccine.Russian state-backed spy group APT has launched cyber attacks on UK labs, according to British spooks. The National Cyber Security Centre has accused the Kremlin of trying to rip off findings so Russia can produce a vaccine at the same time or sooner. NCSC operations director Paul Chichester said: “We condemn these despicable attacks against those doing vital work to combat the pandemic. “Working with our allies, the NCSC is committed to protecting our most critical assets and our top priority at this time is to protect the health sector.” The NCSC – which is part of the GCHQ eavesdropping station – would not identy who has been targeted, but it is thought to include Oxford University and Imperial College London. They both have high-profile vaccine development programmes. Other centres from across the world are also believed to have been targeted. APT “almost certainly operates as part of Russian intelligence services”, the NCSC added. The centre has issued an advisory warning so that organisations have a better chance of protecting their networks. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: “It is completely unacceptable that the Russian intelligence services are targeting those working to combat the coronavirus pandemic.“While others pursue their selfish interests with reckless behaviour, the UK and its allies are getting on with the hard work of finding a vaccine. “The UK will continue to counter those conducting such cyber attacks, and work with our allies to hold perpetrators to account.” APT, also known as Cozy Bear, and The Dukes, has been operating for a number of years but this is the first time the NCSC has publicly linked it to Russian intelligence. The group was previously implicated in attacks on the Democratic Party during the  US presidential election which Republican Donald Trump won.APT’s activities are said to be known at the “highest level” of the Russian state – indicating President Vladimir Putin has sanctioned the attacks. Scientists at Imperial College London and Oxford University have begun human trials of a vaccine. A jab is seen as crucial to lting lockdown. Nations such as Britain have pumped tens of millions of pounds into research but Russia is allegedly hoping to steal the science. UK intelligence does not suggest the hackers are trying to hamper the development of a vaccine – instead they want to copy it. Experts think Russia has tried to exploit VPN connections staff use to link them in a network.  These APT attacks are thought to have begun in late winter. It is said to be using harmful software known as WellMess and WellMail. In the announcement, made alongside counterparts from the US and Canada, the NCSC said yesterday: “APT’s malicious activity is ongoing, predominantly against government, diplomatic, think-tank, healthcare and energy targets to steal valuable intellectual property.” Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy said: “The reported actions of Russian intelligence services should be con­demned. Labour is committed to working with the Government to protect national security and  safeguard institutions from foreign interference, none more so than those leading the international effort to develop a Covid- vaccine.” She urged Mr Raab to provide MPs with “concrete steps that will be taken to protect the UK” from cyber attacks. The Government has confirmed that a vaccine created in Britain would be there to protect people here and across the world. Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who chaired Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee until December, said Russia has been trying to hack systems and “spread disinformation” for a long time. He called the country a “serial offender”. Russian news agency Tass cited a Kremlin spokesman as saying Russia had nothing to do with the attacks.

The latest data suggests that the number of daily new cases has now stopped dropping, with a definite levelling off of cases since the beginning of July. The latest figures were based on the data from almost  million users and , swab tests done between  June to  July. The data does not include care homes. Experts from Kingaposs College London and health tech company ZOE say the numbers over the past few weeks appear to show that new cases in the UK have been increasing. However, the experts say the current estimate is still within the confidence intervals of previous estimates so any increase is not yet deemed signicant. The vast majority cases are from England , with Wales at  and Scotland  per day. The Midlands is the only region where daily new cases numbers are falling, according to the data. The latest prevalence figures estimate that , people in the UK currently have symptomatic Covid. The Midlands is still showing the highest number of predicted cases, but the numbers have been decreasing over the last few weeks suggesting that the localised lockdown in Leicester could be responsible. However, for regions like the North East and Yorkshire the predicted numbers still remain higher than others. Tim Spector, Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at Kingaposs College London, warned the virus is not going away anytime soon.   He said: “After months of seeing the number of Covid cases falling in the UK, we are now seeing those numbers bottom out. We aren’t surprised to see this happening given the easing of lockdown and more and more people working and socialising. The team is keeping a very close eye on the data in order to allow us to spot any potential new hotspots and pick up regions with a signicant increase. The virus is not going away any time so it is really important that people are adhering to the public health messages around social distancing, washing hands, and wearing masks.

To make matters worse, the once-beautul building, which has a leaking roof, was targeted by vandals, who ripped up paving and smashed windows. An estimated £, is needed to restore the “Stute” – Cefn Fforest Miners’ Welfare Hall and Institute – to what was its former glory. Committee member Marina Chacon-Dawson said: “It isn’t in a very good state but some of the features are incredible. “We’d love to restore the feature window on the staircase and the front door had an archway that needs replacing, it was gorgeous. “It used to be a brilliant building and it needs to be saved.

The entries are pouring in from youth clubs, support groups, food and baby banks, small charities and more. The Friends group was set up a couple of years ago by locals in Caerphilly, South Wales. Marina, who has a degree in psychology, said they are hoping it can be transformed into a community hub focussing on wellbeing. “We already have a community centre and a leisure centre but we haven’t got a wellbeing centre. Residents seemed to love it,” she said. “We want to enhance existing facilities in the local community and improve people’s wellbeing. “Ideas include yoga, meditation, craft classes, a radio suite and baby clinic. Occupational courses will help people find the right job for them.” Miners’ institutes were once the focus of working class communities, serving as libraries and reading rooms and a place of recreation. Pit closures swept the UK but many “Stutes” were later revived to serve a dferent purpose.

Built by money granted by the Miners’ Welfare Fund, it was completed in . The Friends have applied for ­charitable status and are bidding to take over the lease for the building, which is owned by the local council. “We want it restored with many of its original features,” said Marina. “It’s too beautul for us to lose – it can help us improve the community for everybody.” Apply today for community cash boost "},{"url":null,"title":"how stop glasses steaming compulsory","story":"NewsHow to stop glasses steaming as compulsory face masks in shops to be introducedWhile the measure to prevent the spread of coronavirus is a basic way of keeping as many people safe as possible, those who wear glasses frequently find that their glasses steam up as warm breath is forced upwards and meets the colder glass surfaceShareCommentsByAbigail OLearyNeil Shaw:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsPeople who routinely wear glasses are finding the wearing of masks a little inconvenient \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Not only does this help to keep you protected against any airborne particles, but it also stops too much breath from escaping and fogging your lenses. For the best fit, your mask should be snug against your nose and cheeks, and there shouldn’t be any slack or gaps for the air to escape. If your mask is not tight enough when you first put it on, try tightening the straps for a secure fit or opting for a smaller size. . Secure the mask around your nose Securing your mask around your nose is another way to limit the amount of breath that escapes upwards. Try moving your mask further up your noseand resting your glasses on top of it to help seal the mask. If this does not work, or your mask cannot be pulled this high, try using a small piece of surgical tape to secure the mask to the bridge of your nose. This helps form a seal to prevent your breath from escaping upwards.  . Think your mask is too big  Tighten it with the ear loops If your mask doesn’t fit tightly, you can try adjusting it yourself. If you have enough slack in the ear loops, try twisting them into an ‘X’ shape and then putting them around your ears. With the self-tying face masks, you can adjust it yourself so that the mask fits closer to your face — just make sure you don’t tie them so tight that you get red marks behind your ears. . Stop your glasses from slipping down your nose Glasses constantly slipping down your nose can be a pain, so why not try wrapping the string of the mask around the sides of your glasses rather than your ear. This might help to make your glasses and mask more secure — just be careful when taking off your glasses as the mask will be attached. It might be that your glasses are slipping down because your frames are not fitting you as well as they did, this can happen over time as we use them day in and day out - they may simply need adjusting. If so, just call your local Specsavers opticians and we’ll be able to adjust them for you, though at the moment this may be by appointment only.  . Breathe downwards into the mask Instead of fiddling with your mask and trying to adjust it, you might find that changing your breathing helps just as well. To prevent your glasses from steaming up, try to push the air downwards when you exhale. It might take a bit of getting used to, but once you’ve got the hang of it, it’s a pretty simple solution. . Clean your lenses It might be that your lenses are prone to foggingit’s been a while since they had a good clean. We suggest using a cloth and cleaning spray, or,they’re particularly dirty or smeared, put a small drop of washing-up liquid on the lenses and rub lightly with your fingers. Then rinse them with warmwater and gently dry with a soft tissue.

She said: For those who think that Covid has passed and everything is back to normal, it is far from it.Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog hereThis virus is still very active and amongst us all acting silently and discreetly. Covid does not discriminate. It is not fussy about what colour your skin is, whether youaposre rich or poor, what race or religion you are or the political views you hold. Covid isnapost particular and nobody is exempt. This is one thing where everybody is in the same boat! The scary thing is Sophie hasnapost travelled on public transport or been for a drink in the local pub. Neither has she been shopping, out for lunch or cuddled up to anyone. In fact she hasnapost ventured out in public at all and has been totally isolating from the outside world. Whilst rehabilitating at home after her double leg amputations, she has been shielding with carers who have been wearing face masks. They have been thorough with hygiene and hand sanitising but this virus has still managed to strike another victim. Sophie is now in a room on her own on a Covid ward in hospital whilst the nurses and doctors work extremely hard to try and win this new battle we face.Sophieaposs health problems began when she was  and studying for a PhD in Counter Terrorism at the University of Hull. She began to suffer with back problems which led to surgery in .Initially, Sophie was able to start physio - but six months later began having seizures and was diagnosed with epilepsy.  She would often drop to the floor asher legs had been kicked out from beneath her and her knees would constantly dislocate causing excruciating pain. Having been backwards and forwards to hospital many times, in January this year it was decided Sophie could not live with the pain of the dislocations and a double amputation was necessary.The operation was then cancelled eight times due to coronavirus, but finally she was able to have the amputation in March, and following that was finally able to sit up for the first time in years.After ing home, Sophie went back into hospital for treatment for an infection in her wound and tested positive for Covid- before being transferred to the Covid ward. Her mum added: That’s whataposs scary, thataposs whataposs knocked me for six, itaposs more contagious than you think. Sophie hasn’t mixed with anyone. No one except for me and her same team of carers has been to see her because she’s isolating, she was shielding until the middle of July. I’ve been in but been a good more than two meter distance away. I’ve had a mask on and have socially distanced. Itaposs probably more airborne than what people are realising.

The cluster has been linked to a private gathering at a home in Limavady, Northern Ireland. Testing and contact tracing is already underway to try to track down everyone who maybe infected with the virus. The PHA said: The Public Health Agency has identied a cluster of Covid- cases in the Limavady area. At present we can link the cases to a social gathering in a private residential setting. Testing and contact tracing is being conducted to identy people who may be potentially affected to help prevent any further spread. With lockdown restrictions being eased, this type of occurrence is to be expected, which is why the Test, Trace and Protect programme is in place. The PHA said it will continue to monitor all cases of Covid-, look for trends and linked cases and advise or inform the public of any increased risk to health. It added: We will not comment on inidual cases as this could lead to people being identied and deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.  We would ask everyone to be mindful of this risk. This virus has the potential to make its presence felt in any district. Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in their neighbourhood right now.

They claim a “new iety” is emerging in the cities of Leeds, Sheffield and Manchester. Younger, middle-class people now use a “general northern English” dialect, which makes it harder to distinguish what area they are from. A University of Manchester team found that while some accent features had vanished, people still used short vowels in words like “glass” and “bath”. They also suggested that prejudice against accents was in decline. Linguistics expert Dr Patrycja Strycharczuk said: “It may seem as though local accents are dying out but we believe we’re actually seeing a new iety becoming established – educated, urban and northern. Its prestige has increased and people are now less tempted to lose their accentthey’ve been to university or do a lot of public speaking.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prince andrews website suddenly vanishes","story":"NewsPrince Andrew’s website suddenly vanishes amid Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell scandalVisitors to Prince Andrews website are instead redirected to a page about the Duke of York on royal.uk as the Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell scandal thunders onShareByJoseph WilkesReporter:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror am celebrity-news video prince-andrew-could-called-give-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news prince-andrews-website-suddenly-vanishes-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The Duke of Yorkaposs site has suddenly vanished from site and visitors are being redirected to an official Royal Family page. This follows weeks of pressure on the -year-old prince after his former pal Maxwell was arrested and charged with alleged child sex abuse, sex trafficking of children and grooming. Prosecutors in the US began to again demand he travel to America to be questioned about what he knew of paedophile billionaire Epsteinaposs crimes. And now anyone trying to access thedukeofyork.org is now redirected to royal.uk, and the section about Andrew.  The Queenaposs third child stepped back from public duties in November , after a disastrous interview with BBC Newsnight over his links with Epstein. The royal.uk page begins by pointing this out and carries the statement the prince released at the time. The statement reads: I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.  His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure. I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations,required.  Andrewaposs social media accounts, on Instagram and twitter, have not shared anything since November . Prince Andrew has vehemently denied any accusations of wrongdoing, including allegations he had sex with Virginia Giuffre when she was  years old.  The FBI previously claimed Andrew had not helped them with the investigation into Jeffrey Epsteinaposs criminal behaviour with underage girls. But a source close to the dukeaposs working group said earlier this month that his lawyers have twice communicated with the US Department of Justicein the past month. The dukeaposs team remains bewildered given that we have twice communicated with the DOJ in the last month and to date we have had no response, the source said.  Andrewaposs contact with the FBI has been a source of tension for months. The Department of Justice in New York, which is leading the investigation into Epstein’s crimes, filed a Mutual Legal Assistance request to the British government. It is a bid to force the duke to supply a statement.  Andrew was yesterday seen for the first time since Ghislaine Maxwellaposs court appearance. The Duke of York seemed in a cheery mood when he was pictured beaming behind the wheel of his Range Rover. He appeared to be laughing with his bodyguard as he drove through the gates of Windsor Castle this morning.

Pupils at the school are aged between five and . Headteacher Jason Brewster has said the school will be re-opened for groups not connected to the infected child on Monday. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.    The email to parents read: We assured you that in the instance of a positive test within our school we would inform you.  Thus it is with a very heavy heart that I am writing to let you know you that due to one of our key worker pupils testing positive for Covid-, we have made the decision to close school with immediate effect. Whilst this premature closure only immediately affects the pupils still attending school, it also means that all staff who have come into contact with the pupil and consequently, other staff must now isolate so school cannot remain open due the staff availability.  The email also states that next weekaposs  Year  graduation and celebration may also need to rescheduled. Mr Brewster confirmed that the school is closed following a confirmed case of Covid- in school. As a result of one confirmed case of Covid- in a pupil at the school, the chair of governors and I made the decision to close the school to staff and pupils. All staff and children who were in the same group or aposbubbleapos as the child have been advised to self-isolate for  days, in line with public health guidance.

But Met Office charts show C in the south by Tuesday - though its long-range forecast shows any warmer weather will be short-lived until at least mid August.  Mr Dewhurst said despite the highs today in the south, Scotland will be a mixture of sunny spells and showers, with temperatures likely around C. Through Friday evening, this band of rain slowly pushes its way southwards a bit further into parts of Wales - perhaps fringing the Midlands at times.  While Saturday will be a grey start in northern England and Wales, with a frontal system staying across the central swathe of the UK through the day, bringing cloud and rain despite some warm temperatures. Showers could be heavy in Scotland and Northern Ireland tomorrow but the sunshine will hold on in the southeast before it falls more in line with the rest of the country on Sunday.

Instead under Vladimir Putin, Russia has become a rogue state, waging a new form of war against The West. It stands accused of undermining sovereign nations through cyber hacking, espionage and spreading misinformation. The charge sheet includes the Salisbury poisonings, interfering in the US elections, sabotaging a French TV station and cyber attacks on the German parliament. We can now add to that shameful list the targeting of UK institutions trying to develop a vaccine for coronavirus. The security services deserve credit for foiling this latest attack. Russia could have joined the effort to find a cure for Covid-. But no. It has tried to secure possibly ground-breaking research by cheating. Putin and his corrupt regime have made their country an international outcast.  Put her on trial Shamima Begum left this country to join a terrorist cult that gloated at the slaughter of her fellow Britons. It is easy to understand the anger at the court’s decision to allow her back to contest the stripping of her citizenship. The fact she has shown no remorse adds to the outrage. But, like it or not, Ms Begum is our responsibility. She was just  when she flew to Syria having been indoctrinated here. However grim her actions she should be tried in a UK court. That is how Britain can show it values fair justice, unlike the regime she championed.

In November, his friend Dylon was stabbed at a party, later dying in hospital. Last weekend would have been Dylon’s th birthday. “I celebrated his birthday with friends and family,” Jermain says. “He would have been the same age as me. It’s had a huge impact on me. I didn’t realise how much at first.” Jermain has campaigned on youth violence since losing school friend Isaiah Ekpaloba to a kne attack months after winning ITV talent show, The Voice, in . “But this is a turning point,” he says. “I have lost so many friends now. I have to turn anger into action.” Today, Jermain chaired a UK-wide video meeting of over , young people to discuss the new Youth Violence Commission report by MPs – hearing a torrent of fears for the future. The report – which promotes a “public health approach” to tackling youth violence – is even more urgent since the Covid- emergency. ­Lockdown has exacerbated almost everything the report identies as preconditions for a surge in violence. The MP who set up the YVC after seeing a string of young people killed in her Lewisham Deptford constituency is no less worried. Vicky Foxcroft says: “We know from the report that domestic violence, poverty, inequality, bad housing, cuts to youth funding, gaps in education are all factors. “This has all got worse in the last weeks. We can’t ignore that being at home for some young people has been more dangerous than Covid-.”The report warns that funding for youth services and Violence Reduction Units in the UKis threatened by post-pandemic austerity cuts.Meanwhile, commission advisers also flagged up the ­deteriorating relationship between the police and BAME communities during lockdown. “There were over , stop and searches of black men between March and May,” Jermain says. “Over % led to no further action. “Yet Police Commissioner Cressida Dick recently said the Met is no longer ­institutionally racist. I’m calling on her to resign. “I honestly believeshe stays in her position, we can expect to see another uprising on our hands.” Jermain speaks from personal experience. “How many times have I been stopped and searched  How many times have you found pennies in your pocket  I’ve lost count. It’s just part of my le. “The first time I was stopped and searched, I was in my school unorm. I was pushed up against a shop window and asked: ‘What have you got on you ’ Nothing. The officer said: ‘I like to give you people a chance, so I’ll ask again…’ “The second time, I was getting a McDonald’s after college. There was something going on, so I walked past, and an officer grabbed me. ‘Where do you think you’re going ’ he said. One of the boys they were arresting had to tell them, ‘he’s not actually with us’.  “Why did they think I was  Because of the colour of my skin. It’s making me emotional because this is the experience of so many black and brown people in London.” After apologising to Team GB sprinter Bianca Williams for a stop and search that saw her dragged and handcuffed in front of her child, Dame Cressida told MPs last week: “I don’t think we’re collectively failing. “I don’t think [racism] is a massive systemic problem, I don’t think it’s institutionalised, and more to the point I think we have come such a very, very, very long way.”Gary ­Trowsdale, lead adviser to the Commission and former MD of the Damilola Taylor Trust, says he’s seen “disproportionate targeting of the black community lead to the worst community-police ­relations since the s. “This is just as the poorest communities are coming to terms with the death toll affecting them worse than others. Hospital cleaners, porters and bus drivers are the families and neighbours of the kids being stopped and search day in, day out.”  Jermain adds: “Covid has discriminated – not the virus itself, but the way it behaved, the way it exploited structural racism.” The cross-party MPs’ report looks at youth violence as a disease, building on a model successfully pioneered in Scotland. The murder rate in Glasgow dropped dramatically when police started to treat communities with compassion, and to treat the causes of the epidemic. It also cost the public purse far less.In the wake of Covid-, Vicky Foxcroft sees a chance for change. “ Coronavirus shows we can react to a public health emergency when we want to,” she says."},{"url":null,"title":"woman who won prizes worth","story":"NewsWoman who won prizes worth £, says comping addiction took over her leRebecca Beesley, , scooped huge cash prizes and a string of amazing money-cant-buy experiences - but said said the highs of have been matched with desperate lowsShareCommentsByWilliam JanesLydia Chantler-Hicks:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsRebecca Beesley has won prizes worth over £, - but at a price \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Rebecca Beesley, ,  scooped huge cash prizes and a string of amazing money-canapost-buy experiences - but said said the highs of have been matched with desperate lows. The mum-of-three found herself skipping showers and meals - glued to her computer for hours on end, scouring the internet for chances to win. But now sheaposs back on an even keel, she also wants to share the good times she still has with comping. Rebecca first caught the comping bug when she was strapped for cash but needed a buggy for her daughter. She said: I didnapost have many opportunities growing up - Iaposm from a single-parent household and quite a poor background. As a child Iaposd see things advertised on food wrappers and think aposwow, people can win cars and thingsapos. My comping started when my daughter was born in . I needed a stroller, so was entering every competition for buggies I could find - then I won one. I was home-schooling my boys then, and in the evenings I started entering competitions as a way of unwinding. Between  and , Rebecca, from Tonbridge, Kent, won a staggering £, worth of prizes - including about £, of holidays, along with smaller items like baby equipment, books, and cosmetics. But with the winning came a buzz, which Rebecca now says was helping with the lows of grief and post-natal depression, and the hobby began to grow out of hand. She said: I think thereaposs underlying stuff going on. I know in my case it was an issue with grief and loss that came to the fore around the same time and comping was my way of escaping that. When I lost my mum, which was some time ago, I kind of covered up the grief and I didnapost let myself grieve properly. I thought aposIaposm ok, Iaposll get through this, itaposll be okapos and I didnapost let myself have any grief. Then a when friend had a loss around the time I was into my comping I found it really hard to deal with because it brought back all of my memories of my own grief. Comping was the thing I went on to because I thought thataposs where I can get a happy feeling from winning something. Youaposre getting that little sense of validation and that little buzz and it became my way of getting through each day. My daughter was very young then and so I think there was some post-natal depression mixed in as well so I think thereaposs a whole loads of thing bubbling together which led to it becoming that extreme. At her lowest points, Rebecca was neglecting herself to chase the high - searching Facebook and competition websites.She said: It becomes a vicious circle. If you start getting wins, it can be hard to see a competition and not enter. I had a bad spell when Iaposd enter everything I could find on Facebook. The next night, Iaposd spend about five hours just going through the previous dayaposs competitions to check there was nothing Iaposd won and missed. At one point during her early comping years, Rebecca was winning a prize every day, on average but she confessed I was probably the unhappiest Iaposve ever been in my le. I was actually skipping showers, skipping meals, just to get in a few more competitions. It had become like a proper addiction. It feels wrong to compare it to alcohol or drug addiction because there arenapost the same physical consequences. But in terms of my mental health, it was my way of getting through the day. I was living for those little buzzes of those emails pinging in saying aposyouaposve won, youaposve wonapos. It was a really dficult time for me. Thankfully, Rebecca has bounced back. While she still plays and wins competitions regularly, she said she has now aposfound a balance.apos She said: I donapost gamble with money but its time I lose, its time with my family and time that I would be spending with my kids so Iaposm conscious of trying to keep that balance. Before it just became really dficult to switch off from the aposcompsapos knowing they were there. Now I just think the competitions are always going to be there, you might miss one or two or several hundred even but they will be there, there will be more competitions in the future, it doesnapost matter.  I have kind of got that sense of perspective again which at the time was really hard. Iaposm probably now doing half-an-hour to an hour a day, but it ies. Rebecca finds contests run by brands she follows on social media, and uses competition listing site The Prize Finder. She says her favourite competitions are creative ones, which take time and thought to enter. She said: The stand-out one for me was winning a Black Tower wine competition, to create a new bottle design. I just did a quick hand drawing, and it won. I loved seeing the bottles in supermarkets. I was so surprised to win - it shows itaposs always worth having a go. But creative entries like videos or building something out of cardboard can take days. When leaposs busy Iaposll just do form-fill entries, or ones where you tag friends. Some competitions are pure luck. At the beginning of this year I won a random draw for a £ cheque from White Stuff. Thereaposs something for everyone in this hobby. Rebecca and her family have enjoyed countless money-canapost-buy experiences, thanks to comping. She said: Last November we won an all-inclusive holiday to Mexico. It was just a lovely break. Back in  my husband won us a holiday to Dubai. It was so special. Theyaposve also won trips to places including Alton Towers, Center Parcs, and Wales. Before the pandemic, they had two stays in Cornwall and a holiday in Milan lined up - all competition prizes. Rebecca has even used comping as part of her sonsapos learning, during home-schooling.  She said: Iaposd find competitions for them to enter - like story-writing. My son loved to cook, and won a cookery competition where we got to have afternoon tea with Mary Berry. Rebecca dislikes the term professional comper, instead describing herself as a competition enthusiast. She said: You couldnapost earn a living out of it because you canapost guarantee whataposs coming. I know some people sell their prizes, but I only enter for things I need, orI know someone who needs it. Some people see comping as a very materialistic, grabby-grabby hobby where people are out to get what they can. Actually, most compers are really nice sharing people. AndI win something from a company and enjoy their product, I become a customer. But she has now written two books about her experiences.As a mum of a young daughter with juvenile arthritis, and having suffered with the condition since the age of  - Rebecca is using the money from book sales to fund Juvenile Arthritis Research, a charity founded by her and husband Richard."},{"url":null,"title":"inside apocalypse proof home can","story":"NewsInside apocalypse proof home that can withstand nuclear strike and keep out Covid-The epoxy-hardened concrete walls of the shelters are up to nine feet thick, and able to withstand critical, natural or man-made conditions, with engineer Larry Hall having transformed the complex into condos in ShareCommentsByAlexander GreensmithRyan Merrield:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video look-inside-doom-boom-bunker-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news us-news inside-apocalypse-proof-home-can-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

I thought it was another kayak,” he told the station.“This thing is so massive... You can see the camera, it shakes a little because its head was right under the kayak rubbing against it.” Kanda recorded the jaw-dropping moment with a GoPro mounted to the kayak and the clip has been viewed more than , times since it was uploaded on YouTube.

A council-run bus service could genuinely serve everyone in the city, while investing profits back into improving the service rather than being paid out to corporate shareholders.#Transport is the most polluting sector when it comes to climate change. To meet the climate targets set at local and national level, we need to change how we think about the way we move around.#Public transport is an essential public service and should not be an opportunity for profit.#An affordable, accessible, and reliable bus service means that people don’t need to drive private cars # it will improve air quality, reduce climate emissions, and make the city easier and safer to navigate for all road users.#The scale of the financial support the Scottish Government is currently handing over to operators, with no conditions attached, coupled with the need to urgently change our transport system, should be pushing every council to consider this option.#Hopefully, Aberdeen can lead the way in transforming the ownership of public transport.#Aberdeen City Council co-leader Jenny Laing said: #We welcome Friends of the Earth Scotland’s endorsement of our proposal to purchase First Bus Aberdeen and run a not for profit municipal bus company.#The council has been responsible for bringing hydrogen buses to the city and we have established hydrogen refuelling stations in order to meet the climate targets set locally and nationally and we are keen to build on these initiatives.She added: #We have long recognised that affordable public transport is essentialwe are to realise our ambitions and retain our place as the energy capital of Europe and we would be willing to work with Friends of the Earth Scotland and other like-minded organisations to try and establish a municipal bus company for the people of Aberdeen.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/07/barsnew-1-940x564.jpg ","title":"nominate your home delivery heroes and tell us about acts of kindness on your doorstep","story":"Lockdown has been one of the hardest times for many families.

That was a bit of a blow.“I drove my car down to the pitch to make sure they weren’t on it, but sure enough, they’d already unloaded their horses and their horses were on the pitch.”He added: “The pitch was looking good, we’ve done a lot of work over the last three months on it to try and get it back to a better playing surface.“But the horses have been down the top end of the pitch.“They’re doing the toilet all over the pitch, and they’re eating the grass, chewing it up and walking about.“Slightly later in the evening, there were kids on quad bikes tearing about the campsite and tearing across the pitch, so that’s going to tear up the pitch as well. It’s a bit gutting to be honest.”The team also play at Balmoral Stadium and Lochside Academy, but both are currently closed.Mark added: “The boys are devastated. Depending how much damage that’s going to do to the pitch, it might not be able to be used until next year, by the time you get things repaired and done properly.“We don’t want to put the kids on itit’s a danger to them. It’s going to implicate a lot of costs for the club as well.”In the meantime, Goals Aberdeen has offered to host the team at a discounted rate.Currently, there is only one official Gypsy Traveller site in the Aberdeen area, with space for  permanent pitches and four short term pitches.The site, at Clinterty near the border with Aberdeenshire, has a waiting list.Councillor Alex Nicoll, whose ward contains Aberdeen Gateway, said: “Clearly, the council need to address the problem of where to have for a Traveller site, because the present arrangements are simply not satisfactory.“There are insufficient pitches, as we know, and there is insufficient availability, and as long as that situation continues, we are going to continue to have the problem of Travellers using unauthorised pieces of land and causing problems for local groups that wish to use those areas.“It really is something we need to resolve, and the sooner we manage to do that the better.“The present situation is simply untenable.”The proposed Aberdeen Local Development Plan  identies five development sites that will be expected to make contributions towards the provision of sites for Gypsies and Travellers.That includes on-site provision at Grandhome, the Newhills Expansion and Loirston, for small sites of six pitches.Scottish Conservative north-east MSP Liam Kerr, who has been contacted by Cove Youth over the situation, said: “I’m shocked and appalled to see this occur at Cove Gateway which is a fantastic facility used by a number of football teams in the area.“For months, the players have been waiting patiently for the chance to play football with each other again and to have this taken away from them is shameful.“This situation is extremely disappointing for everyone at a time when it’s vital we encourage youngsters to get back outdoors and play sport as lockdown eases.“I’m confident Muir Group will act as fast as they can to enforce action to allow the teams to train and play on the pitches again.”Muir Group has been contacted for comment.The Evening Express asked Aberdeen City Council about existing Traveller provision in the city and how the authority expects to resolve the situation with only one available site.A spokesman did not respond to those questions, saying only: “We are aware of this matter and we are in discussions with the land owner over further steps.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 12 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe selfish and reckless behaviour of many people visiting Argyll is to be deplored.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

unavailability of face masks for his family, as he faced the Covid- lockdown with a pregnant we and his dad in a high-risk category.Hass, who had previously set up a global video business, Volcano City, that saw him work with likes of footballer Neymar and pop superstar Katie Perry, spent  weeks researching the market before launching his #sasMASK brand from home, in the midst of the national lockdown.He had been looking after his four-year-old son Otto as a stay-at-home dad and living with his parents in Colinton, Edinburgh, while his home in Musselburgh was being renovated when lockdown kicked in.Their family business, making greetings cards and gts, based in premises at Newhailes Industrial Estate in Musselburgh, was also closed due to the lockdown restrictions.Hass, a member of Musselburgh Roads Cycling Club, said: ldquoDuring week one of lockdown, we discussed as a familywe needed to wear face masks.ldquoWith my dad in a high-risk category and my we Louise pregnant, we decided we did.ldquoI started shopping for good-quality masks that didnrsquot compromise the medical PPE supply chain. However, this turned out to be much trickier than I had expected.He claimed: ldquoThe face masks available at that time seemed to be distributed by untrustworthy-looking websites, looked to be of poor quality, took weeks ndashnot months ndash to arrive and were extortionately priced.ldquoI realised that I couldnrsquot be the only person facing this problem, so I decided to stop moaning and take action ndash and #sasMASK was born.He explained that the #sasMASK is manufactured in Europe and complies with the latest material and layering guidelines for non-medical-grade face coverings.It has not only been designed to be washable, comfortable and affordable, but also comes in more than  designs, with this range due to double in size in the coming weeks, he added.With the wearing of face masks now compulsory on public transport in Scotland, Screen  Shield is expecting orders to continue to surge as Hass, now back at his home in Musselburgh, fulfils hundreds of orders there until he can open a warehouse.He said: ldquoA fundamental aim of the #sasMASK brand was to create a business model that also benefited charities that support frontline workers and community groups.ldquoIt seemed to me that ndash in a health crisis ndash anyone who was selling masks should be giving back to the community, and especially to those hardest hit.ldquoI set up Screen  Shield so that  per cent of all online sales go to NHS-related charities. But any participating community groups charities influencers buying masks for their network also receive  per cent of the sales value ndash as well as their members also receiving a  per cent discount.ldquoAlong with local and national charities, wersquove had the likes of a cheerleading squad, a group of redundant BA staff, a nursery group and a community centre in Somerset all sign up to our community programme.ldquoThey understand their community will likely buy face masks at some point, so by working with us they get excellent quality masks at a discounted price and can also generate funds to put back into their community.ldquoAs we continue to grow the company, I want to generate lots of money for those affected by the pandemic as well as providing a comforting level of protection at the same time.Business customers can benefit from the lsquoTeam Vouchersrsquo system, which provides pre-paid voucher codes so staff can choose their own designs.Screen  Shield is

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus.

Matt Hunt, the CEO of Free The Bears, who is in the programme, I met him when I lived in Australia in  and we started a friendship and have grown stronger ever since. And probably up until  when I took the position, every year for the last six to eight years he must have sent me a job description or a position opening, trying to encourage me to work with or do something for Free The Bears.I was just never in the position in le where it was manageable or achievable until last year - and then I was incredibly lucky, incredibly fortunate in my sort of personal position, that I could effectively take  months out and not get paid very much at all, and go and work for Free The Bears and Matt.HOW WOULD YOU SUM UP THE EXPERIENCE It was one of the most incredible, uplting, and yet challenging periods in my le. I dont even like to call it a career because all Ive ever done since I was  is work for with animals and try and do something to have a contribution to conservation. But in all of that time, living there across  months definitely had its ups and downs to say the least.TO SEE PEOPLE FREELY ILLEGALLY TRADING THE PRODUCTS IN THE LOCAL MARKETS WOULD BE FRUSTRATING That market we went to was not a very prolic one when it comes to wildle. It was frustrating and again, not the first time and not the last time Ive seen wildle in markets... I think the frustrating thing is that the wildle trade is a very, very complex trade, and thats really now starting to become a focus in peoples minds because of the current situation that we face with coronavirus and the fact that its origins have probably come from the wildle trade.But regardless, that was definitely one of the points where I felt very low and very down afterwards because at that particular time I didnt have the authorities with me. And I dont have the authority and I dont have the place to be able to go into a wildle market and start taking wildle without the proper system to be able to back me up.So I had to walk away knowing full well that by the time Id informed the authorities and theyd been able to mobilise, the chances are the next day that those particular inidual animals would have not been there and not made it.YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT THE BEARS AS INDIVIDUALS...When we talk about conservation, and when we talk about the wildle trade, and when we talk about bears as a species, it is ultimately about them as a species... but for me its also about them as an inidual.Because Mary the sun bear, when we confiscated her from the trafficker, or David and Jane, or any of the bears, they dont know that their species is now starting to become endangered in the wild andthis continues in another five years time it could be past the tipping point.What they know of is what they feel as iniduals, which is they feel fear and they feel stress and theyre hungry because quite often most of the bears that we come across are never fed properly. It comes down to balance. I want to help that animal as an inidual, but I also want to be able to help the bigger picture when it comes to species conservation.GIVEN THE CURRENT SITUATION, WHAT DO YOU THINK WE CAN LEARN FROM THIS SERIES I really feel, whether its organisations like Free The Bears or programmes like Bears About The House, for me its about having that respect and compassion and kindness towards the natural world and the animals that are part of that.The most important thing that hopefully will be the bigger context of the situation,we take one thing from it, it should be that we are completely interconnected to other species and the environment around us. If we dont treat that with respect, it will be to our detriment.Bears About The House starts on July  at pm on BBC Two."},{"url":null,"title":"author-patrick-baker-five-scotlands-evocative-wild-places","story":"THERE are certain places that exist at the edge of our collective memory. Ruins and relics which are scattered across Scotlandrsquos landscape, forgotten, overlooked and often hidden by dint of sheer geographical remoteness. I have come to think of them best described as wild histories. Wild, certainly, in that they are located in wilderness areas, but wild also in an almost anthropomorphic sense: feral, uncared for, mostly unknown or nameless, and outside the boundaries of public consciousness.When thought of in this way, the landscape of Scotland becomes a vast diorama: the setting for countless narrative scenes, lives and stories overlaid, some more vivid than others. These wild but often unseen histories define us more than any iconic building or national monument, for they are records of things inconsequential and commonplace. It is this compelling and contradictory mixture of secrecy and signicance that over the years some has led me to become fascinated with some particular wild places.THE GLEN LOIN CAVES, SUCCOTHAlthough I cannot say when or how I first became aware of the Glen Loin Caves, it feels like they have always been there, hard-wired into my imagination. Most people will never have heard of them, but I have come to think of them in near-mythical terms ndash a place of refuge for drovers, brigands, outlaws and even royalty.Among other claims, they were most famously the supposed resting point for Robert the Bruce and his routed army in  after his defeat at the Battle of Methven. More recently, the maze of fallen rocks on this Argyll mountainside was the focal point of a unique, sporting counterculture.It was here for almost two decades from the s that groups of working-class young people, mainly from the poverty-stricken tenements of Glasgow and shipyards of Clydebank, congregated to climb the huge rock walls of the Arrochar Alps.They created an almost permanent weekend residence in the caves. Small groups arrived at first, each with its own particular rules and hierarchies, then more established affiliations evolved. Clubs formed here whose names still resonate with modern mountaineers: the Ptarmigan Club and the infamous Creagh Dhu. The influence of these pioneering climbers was immense, providing a surge in climbing standards and techniques that was unequalled anywhere  at the time. They also redefined the sport, dismantling existing class barriers and creating a makesht society in the Glen Loin Caves whose values and ethics became imprinted on generations of climbers that were to follow.Yet the caves and their whereabouts have managed to remain largely unknown for decades. Hidden partly by the obscurity of the landscape, but also by an unwritten code of fraternal discretion.lsquoThe lad with the clinker-nailed boots and the rope in his rucksack who told me how to find the cave made me promise to keep the secret,rsquo wrote Alastair Borthwick in , in one of the earliest and most detailed descriptions of the caves.lsquoI was to follow a track to a foresterrsquos cottage, pass through a gate . . . and there search for an old sheep fank. Behind it I should find a faint track leading up the hillside andI followed the scratches on the rock it led to, I should find the cave and good company.rsquoEven at close proximity, however, the caves are frustratingly hard to locate. In  it took the writer Rennie McOwan, an accomplished outdoorsman, several attempts to pinpoint the exact position of Borthwickrsquos earlier description. lsquoYou can trace these historic cavesyou know where to lookrsquo, McOwan advised matter-of-factly, lsquobut it can be both time-consuming, and exasperatingyou do not.rsquoTHE NAVVIESrsquo GRAVEYARD, NEAR KINLOCHLEVENAt the start of the th century, in a remote glen in the West Highlands, thousands of navvies were at work on a huge hydroelectric scheme: a massive civil-engineering project near Kinlochleven, which included the construction of the reservoir, a six-kilometre aqueduct and an aluminium-smelting plant.For some of the men that worked there all the inherent danger of their job would suddenly coalesce in a single instant. With a sudden evaporation of luck ndash the misplaced sledgehammer blow, a momentrsquos loss of balance or the abrupt death-strike of unseen rock-fall ndash lives were ended in the wind-torn reaches of the moor.They were laid to rest near where they fell, in a small, improvised burial ground situated below the steep walls of the reservoir. This was the place that the author Patrick MacGill described in his radicalsemi-autobiographical novel Children of the Dead End ndash the navviesrsquo graveyard. It is still bleakly visible in the middle of the vast moor: three rows of headstones sectioned off by a low picket fence, the wood weathered to bone-grey.Even at a distance, its appearance is surreal. It has a strangely filmic quality: dramatic and out of place, like a set design ready to be used in a High Plains western. The gravestones, which were made with concrete from the dam, sit low in the ground, blotched with lichen and listing at angles in the soil.A few have been etched with simple decorative borders, and some carry names ndash all either Irish or Scottish. One in particular stands out, the grave of a woman, buried alongside the men. It challenges perceptions of the place as an exclusively male working environment. The thought of both men and women working here suggests perhaps something more civilised, than the lawless encampment described in MacGillrsquos book ndash a settlement or even a community.Despite the lack of embellishments, the inscriptions on the headstones are exact: neat letterings carved with considerable care. The same effort has been applied to all of them, including one ndash an anonymous grave ndash which, in the absence of a name, simply has the words lsquonot knownrsquo traced delicately across its centre. The gesture is touching. The stonemasonsrsquo precise work, their attention to detail and unbiased craftsmanship, even for an unidentied colleague, still feels like an act of considerable compassion.BELNAHUA, THE SLATE ISLESThe Slate Isles take their collective name from their geological renown. Fine-grained slate rock is found in abundance here in several rich deposits and has been mined since prehistoric times. By the th century the area was held in such importance it was mentioned by Donald Monro, High Dean of the Isles, in his landmark account of the Western Isles.In the centuries that followed, small-scale mining evolved into massive commercial harvesting of the mineral resource. In , the Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant recorded that slates of lsquomerchantable sizesrsquo were being exported in quantities of lsquoabout two million and a half . . . annually to England, Norway, Canada and the West Indiesrsquo.By the middle of the th century this number had grown as much as seven times, and the Slate Isles found themselves at the centre of a global industry, providing jobs to hundreds of workers and supplying roofing materials for buildings all around the world.All that, however, would change. A series of natural and economic calamities, beginning with a storm surge of epic proportions, rendered the mines unworkable and the area destitute. Large swathes of the population left, never to , and the land assumed a look of devastation, houses abandoned and machinery left to rust.The most beguiling of all the islands is the uninhabited Belnahua, the furthest outlier in the small archipelago. A ghost village now exists there rows of empty workersrsquo cottages that still look out over the slate quarry which has long since flooded to form a deep, stilled lagoon.I journeyed there by sea-kayak across some of Scotlandrsquos fastest tidal races, making landfall in front of hollow-eyed buildings with window and door spaces showing light-filled interiors.The best view comes from climbing up a prism-shaped knoll in the middle of the island. From up high you can see the structures that once housed the small community. As well as the terraced workersrsquo cottages, there are a scattering of other buildings: pump houses and engine rooms, coal sheds and outhouses. On the eastern side are two more substantial-looking buildings ndash a two-storey house and a bothy.What is most remarkable though is the slate mine itself now a single flooded quarry of dark water that fills the centre of the island like an ink well. The gouged area is so large that in places only a narrow boundary of land has been left to buffer against the sea.EL ALAMEIN REFUGE, THE CAIRNGORMSNo other mountain area in the British Isles can claim to have had such a large proleration of bothies and high-level shelters as the Cairngorms. By the mid-s, a constellation of these refuges existed across the range, providing a basic form shelter for climbers and mountaineers to overnight on their expeditions in and around the plateau.The names of the old Cairngorm sheltershave always held an undeniable mystique for me. They seem redolent of a bygone, pioneering era of mountaineering. A time, it seemed, when enthusiasm and exuberance appeared to outweigh adversity and a lack of proper equipment.Most of the shelters have long since disappeared: Bob Scottrsquos Bothy destroyed by fire, Jeanrsquos Hut, and the Sinclair Hut run into dereliction or dismantled the Curran and the St Valery demolished. There is one, however, that has for the most part been largely forgotten about. Situated at over , feet somewhere on the steep western flank of Strath Nethy, the El Alamein hut is dficult to find, it walls constructed entirely from rocks barely visible amid a hillside of boulders.The positioning of the El Alamein refuge was a mistake. It was never intended to be built on the northern spur of Cairn Gorm Mountain, tucked literally out of sight and notionally out of mind in a rarely ventured-to part of the Cairngorms. The story goes that its placement was a navigational error. Built by members of st Highland Division and named after one their most famous battles, a mix-up in grid references lead to its construction not on the high plateau, like its sister hut the St Valery, but on an incidental ridgeline.In , the El Alamein and the other two high-level shelters of the Cairngorm plateau became implicated in the Feith Buidhe disaster ndash to this day, the worst, single tragedy in British mountaineering history. Following recommendations of the subsequent fatal accident enquiry, a decision was made to remove of all three of the shelters. Their presence on the plateau was deemed an unacceptable risk. Notoriously hard to locate, it was thought they created a  sense of security, inviting the inexperienced and unprepared to rely unrealistically on finding their protection ndash an often impossible task in winter.After several years of highly publicised and emotive debate, two of the shelters were pulled down. But for whatever reason, the El Alamein never followed suit. Its obscurity and lack of purpose perhaps became the reason for its survival: a barely known mountain refuge, located high on a quiet ridgeline, where it remains to this day.INCHKEITH ISLAND, FIRTH OF FORTHBlack and brooding in the Firth of Forth, Inchkeith Island is easily seen, but often overlooked. I have flown over it many times. On homeward-bound planes which bank low over the coast, you get a gullrsquos eye view of the island.It gives you the chance to survey its complex, post-apocalyptic townscape: deserted roads and decaying buildings, greenery threading through concrete, shrubs emerging from the rubble. Itrsquos a contradictory but compelling mix. A strange scene of urban dereliction in an elemental and unconnected place.That the architecture and edices of dferent times could still exist so forgotten and untouched, yet so geographically close to Scotlandrsquos capital, seems paradoxical, but also makes perfect sense. For centuries, Inchkeithrsquos wild form and isolated position ndash a craggy, kilometre-long, hill-topped rock in the wide, storm-blasted waters of the Forth ndash has both alternatingly defined its importance and rendered it a landscape that can easily be cast aside.Over the centuries it has served a multitude of purposes. Fortress, garrison, farm, lazaretto, prison, religious settlement and even the venue for a bizarre linguistic experiment. As backstories go, it can certainly claim an eventful and troubled past, and more than conforms to the writer Patrick Barkhamrsquos contention that lsquoa few square miles of island loom far larger than the equivalent pocket of land on the mainlandrsquo.The same is also true for the other islands scattered in the Forth, the lsquoemeralds chased in goldrsquo of Walter Scottrsquos epic poem Marmion. Each, I have found out, have their own rich narratives, outsized stories that are much bigger than their contained landmasses would suggest. They are tales of human and natural history ndash warfare and piracy, extinction and regeneration ndash that are intimately entwined with the lives of people far beyond their immediate watery domains.One of Inchkeithrsquos most interesting histories involves its role as a staging post for an attempted invasion of Leith. On  September, a flotilla of privateer warships had reached Inchkeith Island and lay anchored off its shores waiting to attack the port. The small fleet was led by the infamous naval commander John Paul Jones, a Scot by birth who had joined the Continental Navy of the American Colonies and was wreaking havoc around Britainrsquos coastline. Jones was about to mount his offensive when he was suddenly stopped by an unexpected and ferocious storm. Leith was spared by the skin of its teeth, marking a curious historic footnote ndashperhaps the only time Scotland has ever been close to invasion by a military force of what would become the United States.The Unremembered Places: Exploring Scotlandrsquos Wild Histories by Patrick Baker is out now Follow @WildHistorianAs Scotlandrsquos wild places become accessible again, enthusiasm to discover wild histories should always be accompanied by the principle of lsquoleaving no tracersquo: please tread lightly, leave no litter, do not disturb historical relics and respect Scotlandrsquos natural environment."},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Rosemary Goring  Hurrah  The pubs are reopening     here  39 s why I love even the worst of them","story":"This drastic remedy would probably not meet with Health and Safety approval, yet Mr McFadden might have hit on a winning tactic, as the pubs reopen. ldquoPeople are like sheep, he said, explaining the fencersquos effectiveness.

One broiling summerrsquos day my husband, having trekked what felt like the entire Southern Upland Way, finally reached its doors. Sun-baked and sweaty, he entered the bar like a bedouin falling upon an oasis, and with the last of his strength ordered a pint of beer. The publican ndash dressed like a dentist of old, in a white lab coat ndash wordlessly poured his drink and shoved it towards him. When he began babbling his gratitude, and describing the arduousness of his passage over the hills, she cut him short. ldquoNobody told you to do it, she said.The British tradition of outrageously hostile hospitality stretches back long before Basil Fawlty. It seems some of us donrsquot merely tolerate curmudgeons behind the taps but actively enjoy being insulted. The title of Norman Balonrsquos memoir of his years as a Soho publican ndash Yoursquore Barred, You Bastards ndash sums it up. Balon was celebrated as Londonrsquos grumpiest landlord, treasured for his unaccommodating persona. The Coach and Horses, over which he presided irascibly for -plus years, was the haunt of the writer Jeffrey Barnard. His Low Le column in The Spectator was a droll but tragic depiction of a man whose every waking thought led to the next tipple. When Keith Waterhouse turned the column into the play Jeffrey Barnard is Unwell, he immortalised Balon as well as Barnard. These days, I see that The Coach and Horses claims to be the first London pub to offer vegan meals. For a brief spell it even enjoyed a nudist licence. What Balon would have thought about this development would likely be unprintable.Over the years Irsquove spent more hours in pubs than I care to remember, but while the occasional off-taking quip is amusing, serious rudeness makes me head where. Willie Ross, of the Oxford Bar in Edinburgh, was in a class of his own when it came to abrasiveness. Photos show him presiding over his fiefdom, with a face like a hanging judge and a fag in his mouth. Described as instilling ldquosomething close to a sense of terror in customers, he apparently wouldnrsquot serve the English or women. Food was also verboten. Legend has it that when one hapless customer, a QC, askedhe could see the menu, Ross took him by the arm and led him out into the street. Pointing up at the pubrsquos signboard, he said, ldquoWhere does it say f***ing restaurant .No fan of the Edinburgh Festival and its luvvies, he once put up a sign saying, ldquoClosed due to Festival. When I first visited, however, the Oxford Bar was under new management, and far more inviting. By this time Ian Rankin had placed it on the tourist map as Inspector Rebusrsquos local. The countless sightseers who troop into this literary landmark would have got a taste of an altogether grimmer Scotland had Ross still been in charge.The real-ale pub where I used to live was the ideal establishment. The owner had a wicked sense of humour, and tolerated peculiarities on both sides of the bar. On St Patrickrsquos Day hersquod offer a two-for-three deal on all drinks. Other than crisps and peanuts, food was not available, no matter how hard we pleaded. He did, however, allow taxi drivers to bring in their slow cooker after a morning sht, and ladle out chilli con carne while they played cards. In the early evenings, one bloke would bring in a cheese board, and invite everyone to pile in. A mountaineering bicyclist often arrived smelling of woodsmoke and handed out tinfoil parcels of delicious trout, cured in his garden shed. Another old-timer used to produce leeks from his allotment, which he passed beneath the bar in paper bags, like smugglersrsquo contraband. When one night I was cornered by a man who could bore for an hour without drawing breath, the landlord paraded around the crowded room, waving a white flag to summon a rescue party.In an era where the customer comes first, the days of martinets like Ross or the lady of the loch are numbered. I canrsquot say Irsquom altogether sorry. Yet although a good bartenderrsquos manner is part of what draws people back, they canrsquot be bland or dull. Itrsquos a demanding job, and a touch of authority and steel is essential. People capable of handling humanity at its most outspoken, vocal and occasionally insufferable, are rarely naturersquos sweet sherry. I like to think of those with the saltiest personalities as an acquired flavour, like a peaty Islay malt. Ideally, a publican sits midway between the two: a New Zealand sauvignon, perhaps, or dry GT.Itrsquos a job I certainly couldnrsquot handle, especially in a busy city centre. My husband recalls that our wedding ceremony in a Glasgow registrarrsquos office took less time than ordering a drink in the Horseshoe bar. I remember joining him there one evening, when two women arrived and asked for two white wines. ldquoSmall, medium or large  asked the impeccably polite bartender. ldquoBottles, they replied.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The UK Government will publish legislation on the rules that will govern the UK single market to replace the EU single market, which we leave in six months. This will replicate, in theory, the economic level playing field that used to be overseen by the trade regulators in the European Commission.:Opinion: Ian McConnell: Whether European Research Group chairman Mark Francois sees value of EU is neither here nor there amid this Brexit shamblesNow, in his time as a Brussels correspondent, Boris Johnson made his name by traducing these regulations. He pilloried Brussels bureaucrats trying to ban British prawn cocktail crisps, adjudicating on condom dimensions or the degree of curvature on cucumbers. This was mostly journalistic invention. However, there was an element of truth in his Bonkers Brussels stories.To create a single market you have to have common trading and hygiene standards,only to prevent countries using them as ldquonon-tarf barriers to free trade. So there is poetic justice in Mr Johnson now finding himself in the position of the maligned eurocrats and trying to dictate the self-same rules for Scotland through the ldquopower grab.Perhaps Nicola Sturgeon should dust down some of his riper columns. For Mr Johnson also railed against state aid laws that prevented countries supporting their key industries. Mr Johnson suggested that was just in the interest of German exporters. Now the PM is dictating state aid rules to Scotland ndash essentially that we shouldnrsquot have them.Ms Sturgeon calls this a ldquofull-scale assault on devolution. Nor is she willing to accept ldquomutual recognition of trading and health and safety standards regulations which might expose Scotland to American chlorinated chickens and hormone-fed beef.Rather like the unbent bananas, the chlorinated chickens are a bit of a myth, and unlikely to appear on British shelves. The UK Government negotiators have made that clear to their US counterparts.But the Cabinet Office Secretary, Michael Gove, has also made it clear that a new UK internal market regulatory body will call the shots on state aid. It will also alter regulations on food standards and the like without consent from the Scottish Government. So the chemical fowl do perform the politicalof reminding people that the Scottish Parliament does at present have, at least in theory, a veto power over things like health, environment, animal welfare. This is because these matters were not included in the powers reserved to Westminster under the  Scotland Act.Of course, Holyrood only exercised these powers on behalf of Brussels it did not actually set the trading standards or state aid rules itself. However, it did and does exercise a degree of latitude in applying the standards and allocating state aid.For example, the Scottish Government was able to funnel more than poundmillion to Amazon under Selective Regional Assistance and other grants. These are EU-compliant forms of state aid permitted in order to attract companies to unemployment black spots ndash in this case Dunfermline. Ms Sturgeon might be a little shy of referring to that particular exercise in state aid since it emerged that Amazon was paying less in tax per year than it was receiving in ious forms of UK Government subsidies. It was also paying workers rather less than the Scottish Governmentrsquos Living Wage.But the principle is clear: Scotland has a strong case to retain powers over state aid, and not just because of a narrow interpretation of the devolution legislation.In America, supposedly land of the free market, devolved jurisdictions have state aid policies that would delight Jeremy Corbyn. San Francisco gave tax breaks and subsidies to attract Twitterrsquos HQ that could never have been allowed in Europe. In Delaware you can set up a business and pay no tax at all.No one is suggesting that Scotland should become an international tax haven, of course. But it can make a strong case for continuing to have a role in state aid policy, in areas like ferry services to island communities or a public sector bid for rail franchises.Holyrood is also on firm ground insisting that it retains powers over food standards. Scottish beef producers are understandably worried about imports of cheap meat from non-EU countries.

Pick out the juicy tidbits. Is that not the tabloid way, the branch of journalism with which he is most closely associated Look closer, however, and all is not as it seems. The Farage story is fresh, but the Church tale was first aired at the Leveson Inquiry and the Succession point is mere observation. Yet that mix of modes, slipping between fact and fiction, objective and subjective, is the Murdoch way too.Hard man to pin down, Mr Murdoch. This three-part series, a sort of Dynasty without the shoulder pads, was the latest attempt to unravel the enigma, and it showed promising signs of having the chutzpah to go further than its predecessors. Or at the very least make a decent fist of a fascinating story.Made by  Films, the production company behind  , a six part series on the attacks on the US, the first episode featured many of the usual suspects ndash Piers Morgan, once a Murdoch editor, Alastair Campbell, ex-press secretary to Blair, etc ndash saying pretty much what you would expect.The strength of the piece lay in the way it built a story about power: who had it and who did not, and what that meant for the rest of us.So the first episode laid bare the great Blair-Murdoch bromance, begun in earnest when the Labour leader flew to Australia to woo the media boss and his executives. According to Campbell, Murdoch said his rapprochement with Blair was like two porcupines making love: it had to be done very slowly and very carefully. ldquoBit f****** weird, said Campbell.It got weirder. Once New Labour was in government, having secured the backing of the Murdoch empire, the relationship became ldquoalmost incestuous, said Andrew Neil.How close they became was illustrated by the tale of Blair and the euro. In a piece for the News of the World, Blair promised that the UK would not join the EU currency without a referendum. This, according to Nigel Farage, was the price of Murdochrsquos support for New Labour ndash asked and granted.ldquoIf Rupert Murdoch had not done that we would have joined the euro in  and I doubt Brexit would have happened, claimed Farage.What happened next in the programme was more remarkable. The interview over, Faragersquos lapel microphone was taken off. But the main mic was still running.ldquoTo be honest, said Farage, relaxing into off camera mode even though the recording was still going on, ldquoI did ask him whether he wanted me to do this, andhe said no I wouldnrsquot have done it. But he said yes, do it.Now, presuming ldquohe was Murdoch, did this mean the media boss was trying to spin a documentary about himself, to make himself look even more powerful That the filmmakers included the Farage \"extra\" was a promising sign that they were ready to engage in some journalistic rough and tumble of their own to get the story. One fancied Mr Murdoch,he was watching, might have approved.The film had promised to look at the ldquorise and fall and rise again of the dynasty, and by the end of episode one we had entered the phone hacking saga, the point at which the empire quaked.Throughout, the most fascinating segments were those looking at the Murdoch heirs. Much of the material on that subject came from an ABC Australia series, Dynasties: The Murdochs. Whether there will be anything new to add on this, and any other matter, depends on those who have worked most closely with Murdoch speaking out.Thus far, no dice. The most noteworthy thing said by Les Hinton, who worked for Murdoch for  years, concerned a get-to-know you dinner between his boss and the Blairs. ldquoCheriersquos a bit strange but I like him, was Murdochrsquos assessment.

With more than  museums and galleries theand breadth of Scotland, these cultural attractions are without a doubt a valuable societal asset.Research has shown that outings to museums and galleries make us happier, healthier, smarter and more connected to where we live, and this has been born out of the growth in digital interactions during lockdown, with many museums and galleries turning to online to satisfy audiencesrsquo insatiable appetite for cultural connections.While this has created a great swell of goodwill in the sector, the reality is less than rosy for many museums and galleries who are working hard to avoid financial ruin. There is never a good time for a pandemic, however happening at a time when galleries were gearing up for their traditionally busy Easter and summer seasons, the timing could not have been worse.The bottom line is that many venues rely on this crucial trading time to generate up to  per cent of their annual income. This provides the buffer for the off-peak seasons. This, coupled with the reliance on volunteers, many of whom will be shielding, will be a double blow for a sector struggling to make ends meet.There is however a real ambition and determination for museums and galleries to open and we can see from social media interaction that visitors are looking forward to ing.Itrsquos not just a great value day out, museums and galleries have a positive impact on the local economy, with many accommodation providers relying on cultural attractions to entertain visitors.The community benefit also cannot be underestimated: volunteers thrive on being connected to a cause that they are passionate about and the museums and galleries provide a real sense of place that is often reflective of the regionrsquos heritage.What the sector is working on now is how best to open safely and to ensure the visitor experience remains high despite the many changes that will need to be implemented to ensure social distancing. That means that not all museums and galleries will reopen as we enter phase , but they will be working towards welcoming visitors as soon as it is possible for them to do so.For many, the measures required will be too challenging, and they will not be in a position to reopen this year. For others, it will be an unforeseen opportunity to curate exhibitions that are perhaps dferent to their usual offerings.Museums Galleries Scotland is creating an interactive map that will show when venues begin to open.

The executioners wore masks and obeyed the rules of ldquosocial distancing except when they needed to get close enough to inject the pentobarbital. The prison in which Mr Lee was killed was also hit by the virus and was closed to all visitors in March in an attempt to save lives, including, presumably, the le of Mr Lee .To make matters worse, the virus has compromised the system thatrsquos supposed to represent the people facing execution. Mr Lee, who was sentenced to death for his involvement in the murder of a couple and their eight-year-old daughter, had not been able to see his lawyer Ruth Friedman for months. ldquoI canrsquot do my job right, she said a few weeks ago. ldquoNobody can.:Mark Smith: Scottish independence is not inevitable, but we all need to change the way we look at itNone of this should be surprising ndash Donald Trump said he would resume federal executionsand thatrsquos what hersquos done. Hersquos also made the decision in the knowledge most Americans will support him and may not care about the details. Daniel Lewis Lee was an angry and dangerous man, but he was also abused and neglected as a kid. Billy Wardlow was sentenced to death for murder, but when he committed the crime, he was  years old.Sadly, this is often how the story of executions goes, including executions in Scotland. The last man to be hanged here was Henry John Burnett, who murdered his girlfriends husband. As a child, Burnett spent time in borstals and later tried to kill himself the case also happened before legal aid, so he was defended by somebody with virtually no experience of criminal defence. He was executed in Aberdeen in , aged .If any good did come out of the case, it was that it probably expedited the abolition of the death penalty in Britain ndash it happened two years later. But whatrsquos striking is that, despite the abolition, public support for capital punishment was strong in this country and remains relatively high. The most recent Scottish Attitudes Survey shows about half the population supports the death penalty for some crimes.Itrsquos interesting that opinion is ided in this way at a time when it feels like almost every subject, including independence, is split into a binary yes or no, but the breakdown is dferent. We know therersquos a strong socially conservative streak in Scotland but it cuts across all the parties. In the case of Labour, part of its traditional working class support is hard on criminal justice, and in the SNP, the less progressive wing of the movement partly explains the creation of new pro-independence parties led by voices whorsquove been sceptical on issues such as trans rights.:Mark Smith: Anti-Scottish  I think Irsquom finally facing up to my prejudiceWhat all this means is we should remember wersquore not really as progressive as we think we are and that, while support for the death penalty has dropped from about two-thirds in the s, it is still extraordinary that half the Scottish population thinks itrsquos a good idea for the state to kill people. They may even have a preferred method: injection, electrocution, who knows.We should also note that, although therersquos no realistic prospect of the death penalty ing in Britain ndash or in an independent Scotland for that matter ndash it has become a little bit easier in the last few months. As a member of the EU, the UK was banned from reintroducing the death penalty but now that wersquore out of the EU no such ban applies anymore. So, in theory, it could happena future government wanted it.The hope must be, surely, that Scotlandrsquos changing attitudes on capital punishment and other liberal issues such as sexuality would prevent anyto the death sentence. But itrsquos worth remembering that governments do not always follow public opinion. The death penalty was abolished in the s even though the vast majority of people supported it, so presumably the reverse could happen and a future government could ignore public opinion and reintroduce it.: Mark Smith: Take a good look at the Tories who support English independence because it is Scotlandrsquos story tooItrsquos also worth remembering that, although support for the death penalty has dropped since the s, it has dropped at a very slow rate. Yes, itrsquos   now, but think about this: therersquos a good chance that every second person in Scotland will look at the executions of Billy Wardlow and Daniel Lewis Lee during a global effort to save lives and think: good, justice has been served, job done.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

And anyone with serious breathing dficulties such as asthma is exempt anyway.Compared to England and the US - where there have been public protests against mandatory facemasks - hostility to the rule in Scotland has not been so pronounced, perhaps because we have less of a libertarian tradition.But among those who are opposed the same tropes emerge: dislike of being told what to dosuspicions that it might actually be harmful and scepticism of the evidence.What is interesting though, is that all this follows a well-worn template. Take seatbelts, for example.No one expects it to be routinely enforced by the police we do it because it could potentially save our own or others lives in a crash.But there was a time when seatbelts were considered controversial.The state of Wisconsin in the US was the first place to make front seatbelts a legal requirement in all cars built from  onwards.By then, there had already been fierce debate for  years that they might do more harm than good - for example, that they might cause internal injuries or make it more dficult to escape a vehicle which was ablaze or submerged in water. There were claims it would be safer to be \"thrown clear\".There were also arguments that wearing them should be a personal choice, not a legal mandate. Some car owners cut the seatbelts out of their cars in protest.: Slower exit from lockdown has had marginal effect on Covid infections and deathsAs recently as the s most Americans did not use them, and  per cent were opposed to them being enforced by law. As with muzzles for facemasks, seatbelts were depicted as tying up drivers.All this came against a backdrop of a landmark exposeacute in  - Unsafe at Any Speed - by consumer protection campaigner, Ralph Nader, which revealed car manufacturers reluctance to sacrice profits for safety features, despite mounting evidence around preventable death and injury.By the early s both the US and UK were finally making the wearing of seatbelts a legal requirement for drivers and front seat passengers. In, the law was extended in the UK to children in backseats, and to adults sitting in the rear from .Compliance among drivers and passengers is now well over % in Britain, with non-seatbelt wearers accounting for a disproportionate share of road crash fatalities - % in .Vaccination is another area of public health where the science around its benefits has become polluted by conspiracy theories and, of course, the persistent  claims of a link between MMR and autism.Some of the hostility is rooted in ignorance about the science, or scepticism about the motives of \"profiteering\" pharmaceutical companies. But it is also a simple dislike for \"being told what to do\".Immunisation is only effective in terms of creating herd immunityenough of the population comply. If enough people are vaccinated, a given infection has little opportunity to spread.: Why some scientists think handwashing and distancing might be insufficient to limit Covid spreadThat not only protects those who are immunised, but those with health conditions that make vaccination too dangerous. Nonetheless, making vaccination compulsory remains controversial - but sometimes its needed.Even in cases where the dangers are really not in dispute - such as passive smoking - it is hard to imagine that the elimination of indoor smoking would have been achieved without a legal ban.Like vaccination, unless enough people wear masks we wont see the benefit - and really, the purpose is to safeguard the most vulnerable whose own health perhaps might means they cannot wear one.There is nothing to lose and, potentially, quite a lot to gain."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-andre-previn-knew-score","story":"ldquoDonrsquot blunder into traps set at rehearsals.

For the audience, this mix of quizzical admiration and a sense of mounting calamity mean itrsquos impossible to look away.However, as an audience, the Scottish public today finds itself at the interval ndash kept on tenterhooks with the lead character, the SNP, poised precisely midway between absolute victory and complete defeat.In a Western world where trust in politics is supposedly dead, the SNP defies the new norm. After a shaky start to handling Covid ndash which many commentators, myself included, rightly gave Nicola Sturgeon a hard time for ndash the Scottish Government broke out of effective lockstep with the shambolic UK administration. As Boris Johnsonrsquos government staggered from one insulting, dangerous absurdity to another, Sturgeon projected calm and honesty ndash at the very least she was able to convincingly present herself as a person voters can trust.If looked at from the perspective of history, therersquos certainly an academic argument to be had, weighing the dferences between how Edinburgh and London faired over the unfolding course of the pandemic. Some will say that in terms of hard policy therersquos been little substantial dference in the actions of the two governments, and that when it comes to the numbers of fatalities therersquos really not a lot statistically between the UK and Scotland. However, that perspective is increasingly more dficult to accept with each passing day as the dferences between the two countries and their approach to Covid become more starkly defined.The harsh truth, however, is that policy nuance and the fine detail of statistics donrsquot really matter that much in political terms. What matters is: are you a convincing and trusted leader  When it comes to Johnson the answer is a screaming No with Sturgeon itrsquos a resounding Yes.

The currency of trust could quickly devalue. Faith could become revulsion. Scandal could supersede success.This corrosive circus comes as the Yes movement starts to split, reflecting the deep, dangerous fissures within the SNP. For a long time, therersquos been a growing gulf between fundamentalists and gradualists. Now a new independence party has appeared threatening list votes for Yes.The SNP is ided not just over how to achieve independence ndash and when ndash but on a flotilla of existential issues. The splits are town-country, populist-centrist, woke-traditionalist, green-business, left-right, and even Leave-Remain.Inevitably, for an umbrella party which needs to pull as many into its big tent as possible, minor fights are taking on the shape of destructive ision. That big tent has been up so long that punters inside are starting to turn on each other.Then therersquos the perception of growing anti-English sentiment. To be fair, the perception is mostly driven by fringe extremists many of whom have nothing to do with the broader Yes movement. But as with trust in the SNP over Covid, itrsquos perception that matters not facts. When the First Minister has to tell voters she doesnrsquot have ldquoan anti-English bone in her body, itrsquos clear matters have gone off message.

When these gained no traction, further attempts were made to promote the illicitly acquired material online in the run up to the General Election.\"Whilst there is no evidence of a broad spectrum Russian campaign against the General Election, any attempt to interfere in our democratic processes is completely unacceptable. It is, and will always be, an absolute priority to protect our democracy and elections.\"He added that there was a criminal probe ongoing into the \"illicit acquisition\" of the documents, and so \"it would be inappropriate for us to say anything further at this point.\"He continued: \"The Government reserves the right to respond with appropriate measures in the future.\"The UK will continue to call out and respond to malign activity, including any attempts to interfere in our democratic processes, alongside our international partners.\"We fully support the recent action taken by our German partners who exposed Russian responsibility for the hack of their Parliament in  as well as their intention to act against those responsible under the cyber sanctions regime.\"The UK Government laid the statutory instrument for our own cyber sanctions regime on  June.\"The Labour party said it condemnded any Russian interference with UK politics.A spokesman said: \"We condemn any attempt by Russia to interfere in our countryrsquos democratic processes.\"Labour stands ready to work cross-party to protect our nationrsquos security.\"That includes in our response to publication of the long awaited report by the ISC on the Russian threat to the UK"},{"url":null,"title":"gove-accuses-russell-misrepresenting-westminster-trade-plan","story":"The -page dossier sets out the internal market plan, which the SNP claim is a ldquopower grab and a threat to devolution.A row has been growing over the new legislation as Westminster officials say it will result in a ldquopower surge for Holyrood as well as devolved governments in Wales and Northern Ireland.Scotland would receive more than  new powers under the measures, claims Boris Johnson.However Mike Russell, Constitutional affairs secretary for the Scottish Government today branded the promises ldquoa lie and said many of the powers are already within Holyroodrsquos remit.He said: ldquoThese arenrsquot new powers for the Scottish Parliament, that is actually ndash I am sorry to call it this ndash a lie.ldquoThe list of powers is dishonest.

These will be the toilets at the Travel Centre and St Magnus Lane in Kirkwall and at the Pier Head and Ferry Road in Stromness – with more to follow over the weeks ahead.The council says each will have one ladies’ toilet, one gents’ toilet and an accessible toilet available for use.“Hygiene and physical distancing requirements mean that considerable work is needed at each site before the toilets open again,” said Hayley Green, OIC’s head of IT and facilities.“This means that it isn’t possible for us to open all of Orkney’s public toilets in one go.“You will notice quite a few changes inside and outside the toilets. Please follow the instructions we’re providing in order to minimise any risks to yourself and our cleaning staff.“Work is carrying on to re-open more public toilets over the next few weeks # keep an eye on social media and the OIC website for further updates.”OIC have also provided the answers to some frequently asked questions about the re-opening of the public toilets.We need to introduce quite a lot of physical changes to our public toilets in order to meet Scottish Government guidance. We are also having to arrange to clean them more often, and so we are discussing with our staff and contractors about how this will be done. This is why we can’t open all the toilets on the th, but we are aiming to have all public toilets open during August. There will be physical changes both outside and inside the toilets. You will be asked to follow physical distancing markers outside the toilet, and not all the facilities inside the toilet will be available. Because of this, please allow a little longer for your visit as you may need to wait for the toilets to be free. The toilets will need to be cleaned more frequently, and we will provide liquid soap for you to use to wash your hands, as well as a supply of cleaning products as required. We would ask everyone to please leave the soap and the cleaning products in the toilets for the next person to use # please do not take them away with you. There is still some element of risk around using public toilets, and that is why we are having to make the changes described above. We are following Scottish Government guidance, which can be found here: https:www.gov.scot publications coronavirus-covid--public-and-customer-toilets-guidance pages hygiene-measures We have carried out risk assessments for each site and also a general risk assessment for the process of cleaning the toilets during the pandemic. All of our staff are being briefed on any changes to their working practices and equipment, including PPE where needed, will be provided. Trade Unions have been provided with the risk assessments and given the chance to make any comments. We are currently working with our cleaners, including those who do relief cleaning for the council, as well as our contractors to assess their availability. If we need more cleaners, we will be looking to advertise this and recruit folk over the next few weeks.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Visitor numbers will also be limited for safety reasons.Alex Paterson, chief executive of HES, said: “At the forefront of our planning is the safety of our staff and visitors, whilst being able to reopen for the tourist season by gradually enabling safe access to our properties and facilities in line with Scottish Government guidance.“We’ve been working exceptionally hard to ensure our properties will be accessible and ready to welcome visitors, however, it’s important that we implement our resumption plans at the right time given the dferent requirements for each site.“This also includes looking at the ying local and regional requirements throughout the country and we have considered this when setting out our phased approach to welcoming visitors back and supporting Scotland’s tourism and economic recovery.”“We’re very much looking forward to welcoming visitors back to our sites. There will of course be some initial changes including managing visitor numbers at certain sites, as well as restricting access to specic locations, but we can assure visitors of a warm welcome as always.“We want to ask our visitors to help create a safe environment by behaving responsibly and following our guidance at properties, and we will be providing further information on our website for visitors to help them prepare for their visit.”HES has also published policy and guidance for the reopening of the properties in its care.The standards have been developed from a wide range of sector and industry advice, guidance and best practice, and set the benchmark for the safe reopening of sites and resumption of operational activities. The Operating Standards have been published to provide a resource for the wider heritage sector, and to support and assist other organisations with their own resumption planning.For further information on the re-opening please visit www.historicenvironment.scotTo view the COVID- Policy and minimum operating standards, visit: historicenvironment.scot covid--operating-standardscopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In order to allay concerns regarding public safety, VisitScotland, alongside the national tourism bodies of England, Northern Ireland and Wales, announced a new UK-wide industry standard and consumer mark to provide confidence for visitors, communities and tourism businesses alike, as the sector works towards reopening.Since its launch, last month, over , businesses have signed up to the ‘We’re Good to Go’ scheme. A new visitor charter was also created by the national tourism organisation aimed at encouraging safe and responsible travel around the country. Businesses are currently updating their listings on visitscotland with opening information to make it easier for visitors to plan ahead.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive said: “Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover.#The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen. It’s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.“July  marks a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this ‘new normal’, so it’s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.“We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone — visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.“For more information on travelling in Scotland visit visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It will see the installation of a new  kilovoltcable which follows the existing route from Murkle Bay, near Thurso, to Rackwick Bay in Hoy. The cable is expected to arrive by Wednesday next week, July .SSEN has said the installation of the new cable will allow for the removal of some sections of existing overhead line on Hoy, to be replaced with underground cable. Work is expected to be completed by November, following an extension of the programme to avoid construction during bird breeding season on the island.Mark Rough, director of customer operations, with SSEN, said: “We’re committed to ensuring a safe, secure and reliable supply of electricity to our customers and this critical investment project is an essential part of that commitment.“We’d like to thank all stakeholders for their feedback on our proposals during our open-door events last year. Following consultation, we’ve scheduled installation to minimise disruption on local marine le, with the works also planned to avoid the main breeding seasons for key bird populations.“I’d like to reassure our customers that our teams and contracting partners continue to adhere to social distancing measures and Government guidance to protect the safety of the local community as we carry out this signicant programme of works.”The Pentland Firth East cable was identied for replacement after routine inspections found it was coming to the end of its operational le. In July , SSEN successfully completed repairs to the cable in Rackwick Bay following a cable fault. While customer power supplies were not impacted by this fault, a long-term solution was required to maintain a safe, secure and reliable power supply to homes and businesses in Orkney.For more information on the Pentland Firth East cable replacement project, click here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But he soldiered on to complete his first nine holes in an estimable  shots.Goodness only knows what happened at half time but he required only  shots for the second nine, a gross score of  and a nett  which was to be the joint lowest nett score recorded during the whole weekend.Great stuff there and with a higher handicap than all those around him and very much in contention he has nothing to lose in the second and final round.Best wishes Ross-great play!Of course that#s only one round gone but with one still to play the likeliest contenders to depose those already occupying the qualying positions could be Chris Mackinnon, Murdo Gordon, John Finlayson, Robert Macaskill or even Dan Macdonald.Chris was  , Murdo#s halves were  , John#s loops were  , Robert was   and finally young Dan was  .All these guys have a chance depending on how the leaders perform next time out but an honourable mention for John Finlayson who, like Ally Young in the RNLI Shield last time out compiled a fine score in the worst of the conditions.Sunday dawned cold, wet and very windy and both he and his companion for the day wondered at the outset whether they would be able to complete their round as the greens were already holding water.Two birdies in the final three holes of the first nine must have inspired John to dig in and that is exactly what he did to retain his chance of qualication.Although the competition is played off scratch the four players with the best two-round handicap scores will compete for the consolation #handicap# championship.A meritorious performance here to consider for inclusion might well come from Hamish Philp whose nett  off a  handicap was a terric performance in his renaissance as a golfer.Obviously off that highish handicap his numbers won#t compare too favourably with the #lower# men but two loops of  and  in the steady Saturday morning rain should give him a tremendous boost of confidence for both round two and the rest of this fledgling season Sunday morning#s weather conditions meant the scheduled ladies’ competition was abandoned without a ball being hit.However, a couple of days later a lovely sunny and warm Tuesday welcomed a small group for another round in the Glamaig Stableford competition and yet again Sandi Beatson was declared to be the clear winner.That#s four successive victories and this time the margin was six points over her nearest pursuants Sandra Dew and Shona Jackson.With respect the scoring wasn#t great but was readily acceptable within the confines of the competitors and that#s plenty good enough.The first midweek competition of this much-delayed men#s season was played for the Strath Cup.This trophy is usually decided on a season-long, best three from four scores basis but the club mandarins have to cut and paste a structure in this necessarily compressed playing season to keep the members and competitors happy so it was all or nothing in one single day.And what a day it turned out to be with warm sunshine and just a whisper of a breeze for the thirteen hours of competition.The fly in the ointment though was John-the-Greens# concept of what constitutes a #challenging# hole position on his well-nourished, nicely manicured putting surfaces.Rumour has it that he#s #a bit of a player# but as he#s yet to strike a single ball in anger the jury remains quite positively indecisive on that one.However, on the assumption that he does actually play the #great game# his mischievous positioning of pins-when he doesn#t have to try to access them-is causing some consternation and rabble#s babble.Irrespective of the pin positions however, Batman and Robin were at it again as playing companions for yet another highly successful day.Archie Macaskill and John Maclean reprised their excellent performances from round one of the Club Championship last weekend to finish first and second respectively.Off the tee in the second group of the day and having overtaken the trio of old boys in front they were the first players to log their scores and their totals were to remain nonpareil all day long despite a mighty challenge from the large group of competitors.Archie won the trophy and took the honours with  points, his two nines being  and .Going out-of-bounds with his tee shot on the fourth hole was to cost him an  but he immediately secured a birdie  on the very next hole to get him up and running again.Celebrating his th birthday on the course that very day the youngster went on to finish strongly with two more birdies in the final three holes of his round-great stuff and very well done.John Maclean is playing more golf than for many a year as the pandemic has meant that his tourism-related business is closed and is likely to remain so for the time being.But that has allowed him to play more golf, work on his game and slowly but surely his handicap is coming down. shots were required for the first half and  for the second was good enough for  points and also included three birdies so the dynamic duo obviously gel very well on the golf course.Eased out of second place by virtue of the better inward half Lou Gordon nevertheless ed a highly creditable score of pts.Lou navigated the outward half of his round in a miserly  shots and like Archie and John also had three birdies-in the space of five holes. But two lost balls off the th tee unfortunately put paid to his chances of victory.Graham Smith and Ryan Macaskill were the #best of the rest# as they both signed for respectable pts totals # the former easing the latter by….you know the story by now Graham required  blows for his first lap but a sparkling  shots for the second lap with five straight pars to finish showed guts, determination and the promise of things to come Ryan is fairly steady off his  handicap and   was pretty well run of the mill scoring for him. An incident-free round.Honourable mention in this competition for Andrew Long who after a faltering start turned-to in good order slotting four birdies in the run-in, including three birdies in the first four holes of lap two.This weekend the ladies will be competing for the #First Minister#s Quaich# while the gentlemen will play for the #Iain Campbell Memorial Trophy# # in scramble format # on Saturday with a pop-up Bogey competition scheduled for Sunday.On reflection then the golf season on the Isle of Skye is successfully up and running, the course is in excellent trim but still the times are strange.Quite correctly denied the use of the clubhouse to date and sadly for the foreseeable future the club lacks a focal point and with competitors playing with their pals social integration and interaction is exiguous to say the very least.It#s important that we appreciate and enjoy what we#ve got, reflect on what was missing from our lives for the three months of lockdown and just play golf and look forward to a brighter future.:  S Beatson pts .S Dew pts bih  S Jackson pts.: Leading Scores. .

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

Measures that were previously regulated by the European Union willto the UK at the end of the year when the transition period expires. Responsibilities in  policy areas - including animal welfare, public procurement rules and environmental regulations - will now go to one or more of the devolved administrations.The way the Government is handling theof powers from Brussels has already provoked a row with Nicola Sturgeon#s administration in Scotland after it was revealed that Whitehall will assume control of the state aid regime. The proposed changes - set out in a white paper being published today for consultation - will see Northern Ireland receive responsibility in  of the  areas, Scotland in  and Wales in . As this could lead to dferent regulatory regimes in the UK the Government has drawn up plans for the internal market to ensure seamless trade between the home nations. At the heart of the plans are the principles of mutual recognition - so regulations in one part of the UK are recognised in all the other nations - and non-discrimination, providing a level playing field for companies across the UK. Officials said that without these actions a Welsh lamb producer could end up unable to sell their meat in Scotland, or Scotch Whisky producers could lose access to supply from English barley farmers. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said: This plan is vital to protect jobs and livelihoods across all four nations of the UK. Northern Ireland exports more to the rest of the UK than to all of the EU combined - nearly % of Northern Ireland#s total external trade is with Scotland, Wales and England.We will be enshrining in law the UK Government#s guarantee that Northern Ireland businesses will benefit from unfettered access to the whole UK market. And we will implement the Northern Ireland Protocol in a way which safeguards the effective working of the UK#s internal market.Making sure that seamless domestic trade can continue will support our economic recovery, provide certainty for businesses and create more opportunities for investment across Northern Ireland.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Covid- cluster outbreak found in NI town linked to house gatheringPerfect match: Ulster star Jacob Stockdale gets engaged to old school friendUnmasked: Breakdown of Northern Ireland Covid- deaths by postcodeBe prepared for Leicester-style lockdowns, NI chief medic McBride warnsNuclear submarine metres from hitting Belfast ferry, investigation finds ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Face masks - will you be wearing them for a trip to the shops  Let us know your views in the comments.Posted by Belfast  on Wednesday, July , Those who did have their faces covered on the streets of the two cities on Wednesday afternoon were supportive of the move, including Monica Robertsfrom Loughinisland.

If everyone wore one it would give me reassurance that we#re all in the same boat and have to look after each other.

This can include a piece of paper towel or silk.If you make a pocket in the middle of the mask the paper towel slip can be changed every time it is washed.let embedUrl  https:belfasttelegraph.bbvms p twocol_article c .jstry .textContentembedUrl +  dart_gs_channels +  catchconst el  documentel.async  trueel.src  embedUrldocument.getElementByIdChildHow do I fit my mask properly Have it tightly fitting in order to block droplets coming from the mouth.It also needs to fit around the chin and cheeks.

I found at the weekend I was nursing one or other of the children all day and it came to the evening time and there was one I hadn#t really had time to nurse.These are very precious times when we can all be together and share the fun and noise Marie LindsayIt is like all children by their very nature - some like being held and love cuddled more than others but I make sure I spread my time evenly.Initially, after they were born I found it dficult that I wasn#t able to help my two daughters with their new babies but now I find I just love nursing my grandchildren. I find it so relaxing and the whole day can pass in a complete blur because I am so absorbed in their little world.These are very precious times when we can all be together and share the fun and noise.The birth of these two sets of twins to her two daughters factored in Marie#s decision to step down from her role as principal of St Mary#s - a post she has held for the past  years.She added: I would probably have been thinking about retirement because I have spent a total of  years teaching in St Mary#s and  as principal but certainly the arrival of the four grandchildren was a factor.

Trying to give comfort and help to folk in trouble. And again, it#s people from all backgrounds and faiths who come to me. Everybody#s problems are dferent but their needs for comfort, help, discernment and guidance are all equal.The MP adds that he has been given a practical day-to-day insight into the faith by his Catholic constituents.Whilst my faith may not require me to light a candle for a bereaved loved one or friend, I wouldn#t dismiss lightly that kind of public display or token of concern and thought Ian PaisleyWhat strikes me most is that they are unashamed and are never embarrassed about having a faith that promotes devotion and values family, children and le, he insists. These values are identical to my own beliefs. Whilst my faith may not require me to light a candle for a bereaved loved one or friend, I wouldn#t dismiss lightly that kind of public display or token of concern and thought. Even Christians can sometimes be too stf-upper-lipped to express emotion.Describing himself as a long-time campaigner for the protection of the rights of the unborn, Mr Paisley said it was without doubt the strongest support he has received - both publicly and privately - has been from his Catholic constituents.They are quite happy to tell me that they disagree with many aspects of my politics, he admits. But they say that#s easily put aside when they know I#m fighting faithfully on this matter. To hear them say this - either privately in whispers or more publicly - brings a wave of real encouragement and a sense that I am doing the right thing. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePro-le campaigners on the streets of Belfast have the backing of Ian Paisley FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPro-le campaigners on the streets of Belfast have the backing of Ian PaisleyJust in the last six months, I#ve received over  letters and emails from constituents who are Roman Catholic offering support on this one issue. That cannot be overvalued.He goes on to say that this is in sharp contrast to those who take the same stance in his own faith.As an evangelical Protestant I get tired by the embarrassment some of my faith have in declaring pro-le views, explains Mr Paisley, They say to me: #Yes, Ian, you might think that but you can no longer say it#, or #I agree with you, but we#ve just got to leave it with the Lord and realise we can#t do anything about it#.Frankly, that lack of faith appals me. Maybe it#s because I was brought up by a man of action that I just won#t let go. But I think it#s also the fact that my Roman Catholic constituents want a champion, even when the odds are stacked so decisively against us all on this issue.Stressing that he admires that loyalty and determined spirit, he also singles out anti-abortion campaigner, Bernie Smyth, who heads up Precious Le.She very happily signed my Westminster nomination on the basis of my pro-le credentials. I was moved by the fact that she was publicly happy to nail her colours to the mast, said the MP.Northern Ireland is a small place. That sort of public declaration doesn#t go unnoticed. The local parish priest also wrote to me before the last election. He told me he was openly urging anyone who would listen to him to support me because of these credentials. Then, in a practical way, the community put their money where their mouth is, sending me members to join my campaign team to put literature through doors and talk to constituents about the matter.That reminded me of why I admire my Roman Catholic friends.

They are pretty easy to suss out though, you get used to it, he told RSVP.He also admitted that being romantic hasn#t always been his strongest quality.I make an effort but it doesn#t come naturally to me, unfortunately.He had previously been in a two-and-a-half year relationship with Queen#s University student Jessica Gardner before splitting in .After Covid- paused the Six Nations earlier this year, Stockdale will now face fresh competition for a starting spot with the signing of Kiwi James Lowe.This will only be increased with the recent confirmation that the Lions tour in South Africa will still be able to go ahead next year.With Ulster resuming light training in recent weeks, Stockdale admitted he used the three month gap to re-watch every one of his matches with Ulster and Ireland.It#s probably a bit sad to admit that, but it#s something that I wanted to do just to see how I#d played, he told the BBC.It was really nice to look back at the games and realise the learning points that I#ve made over the course of my career so far.As well as reliving his career highlights, he also shared in May that lockdown has allowed him to indulge in his love of classic cars by attempting to restore a  Mustang he bought on eBay.At the height of the pandemic restrictions he also took part in a phone-a-friend campaign with the mental health charity Aware.I had my girlfriend around during lockdown, but I have friends who had to isolate by themselves for  weeks and it can be a struggle and a dficult time, especiallyyou are living with depression or any mental illness, he said at the time.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Covid- cluster outbreak found in NI town linked to house gatheringPerfect match: Ulster star Jacob Stockdale gets engaged to old school friendUnmasked: Breakdown of Northern Ireland Covid- deaths by postcodeBe prepared for Leicester-style lockdowns, NI chief medic McBride warnsNuclear submarine metres from hitting Belfast ferry, investigation finds ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

During his first visit to Belfast as Taoiseach, Mr Martin met with the First and Deputy First Ministers in Stormont Castle, as well as the leaders of the smaller parties.Despite renewed tension between the DUP and Sinn Fein over the Bobby Storey funeral, Arlene Foster and Michelle O#Neill appeared together for a picture with Mr Martin on his arrival.Speaking afterwards, he said the wide-ranging discussions focused on suppressing any spikes in Covid- and minimising economic disruption caused by Brexit.He quickly side-stepped a question on how the First and Deputy First Ministers could reconcile, saying: I would never attempt to advise others in terms of relationship-building, but I think we had a very good, warm meeting today. Stressing the need for all-Ireland cooperation, Mr Martin said the Good Friday Agreement would remain the defining blueprint in a post-Brexit world.Given the enormous change that is taking place, there is a need to do some signicant work together in terms of... how we share the island in peace and in harmony, he said.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMicheal Martin sitting down with the First and Deputy First MinistersPA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappMicheal Martin sitting down with the First and Deputy First MinistersThe Taoiseach said he was delighted that the first North-South Ministerial Council in three years will take place at the end of the month following the Stormont deadlock and disruption caused by Covid-.The body cooperates on areas such as the environment and waterways.Overall, I#m very encouraged by the meetings I#ve had... a genuine desire on all sides to work together in a pragmatic way to the mutual benefit of all the people of dferent traditions on this island, he said.After years of strongly criticising Sinn Fein as Fianna Fail leader, Mr Martin was askedhe would now soften his approach in his new role.My views on Sinn Fein are well-known, I#ve articulated them as a party leader... but as Taoiseach one has to be very conscious of the objective of the country, he said.He also played down any concerns over the dferent pace of lockdown on both sides of the border.Let#s be fair to both administrations, Covid- has been suppressed to a signicant degree, he said.That said, in the Republic over the last week or two we#ve had an increase in numbers, which the health officials are worried about.He added: All of us are very fearful of a second surge in the autumn, we#re very anxious to get the schools back and to deal with the non-Covid strand of medicine.Mrs Foster said she told the Taoiseach she looked forward to a positive dialogue during his tenure based on mutual respect for both jurisdictions and understanding each other#s dferences.Recovering from coronavirus had been the main focus of the meeting, she said, and working to rebuild both economies and protect public health. Mrs O#Neill called on Mr Martin to honour commitments made by the Irish Government in the New Decade, New Approach deal.I look forward to working on a north-south basis to ensure those crucial funding and practical commitments are fulfilled as soon as possible, she said.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMicheal Martin removing his face mask as he prepares to meet party leaders at the Stormont Hotel FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappMicheal Martin removing his face mask as he prepares to meet party leaders at the Stormont HotelShe also backed recent calls to increase the use of mandatory face coverings in public. The Chief Medical Officer has made it very clear that while perhaps at one stage of this pandemic he was not convinced of the merits of face coverings, we are now in a space where he thinks that is the case.We will look at all of that evidence and then make a decision on that, but I think that as more and more people are moving around as we come to the end of the shielding period, there is probably a logical reason as to why face coverings should be a thing that we are all .Speaking to the media without Mrs Foster, she explained that they had moved naturally away from their joint appearances at the daily Stormont briefings.Mrs O#Neill echoed the Taoiseach#s call for an all-island approach to Covid-, and said the two governments# chief medical advisers were working closely together.Although Sinn Fein has now resumed the role of Opposition in the Dail, she promised to cooperate with the Taoiseach in his role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.In a statement, she also stressed the importance of the North-South Ministerial Council ing to work after a y absence.It is now six months since the restoration of the Executive and I made clear to Micheal that we must see delivery of all the Irish Government#s commitments in New Decade, New Approach.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Covid- cluster outbreak found in NI town linked to house gatheringPerfect match: Ulster star Jacob Stockdale gets engaged to old school friendUnmasked: Breakdown of Northern Ireland Covid- deaths by postcodeBe prepared for Leicester-style lockdowns, NI chief medic McBride warnsNuclear submarine metres from hitting Belfast ferry, investigation finds ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much.

Mr Middleton said: ‘‘The restrictions placed on pregnant women and their partners at the height of the first wave of Covid- demonstrated the serious threat posed by the virus and the disruption it caused to even the most cherished aspects of le in Northern Ireland. The guidance that took effect on  July was therefore extremely welcome, once again placing the onus on Trusts to facilitate birth partners seeking to accompany women to a range of maternity appointments. This included, but was not restricted to, dating and anomaly scans, induction of labour, the duration of labour, for birth, and visits to antenatal and postnatal wards. googletag.cmd.push I am becoming increasingly concerned that these rights have not been restored in a consistent or fair fashion. Whilst some Trusts appear to have honoured the guidance in full, the Western Trust have been limiting relaxations to -week scans only. This has led to a perception of a double standard. It is wrong that some birth partners are granted greater access than others simply because of where they live. Every pregnancy and every partner should be treated equitably and fairly. I would urgently call on the Health Minister to take steps to recty these concerns and issue clearer guidance.’’ googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This sweet and gentle dog was stray for quite some time and covered over  miles on his travels, carrying on even after he was hit by a car. Thankfully, he was brought to Friends of Rescue who gave him a full MOT before nursing him back to health in foster care. Now Miles is looking for a home to call his own, with a very secure garden. We were tracking Miles for over a week and there were sightings of him all over the place, said Friends of Rescue founder, Suzanna Flemming. googletag.cmd.push He was on the run and losing weight quite rapidly. He was hit by a car and still kept running. Thankfully he had no broken bones and was just a little stf and sore, but he had a lot of scarring on his body new and old. After a well deserved bubble bath he was wormed and flead and we got him into foster care and got him fattened up a little bit and neutered, chipped and vaccinated. Miles is a special dog and will need a special home. He is doing his very best in foster but he is still a very nervous man and he will need time, reassurance and most of all patience, said Ms Flemming. googletag.cmd.push Miles would benefit from another dog or dogs in the household but no young children, and this is purely down to his nervousness. And hell obviously need an extra secure garden so that he doesn’t ‘try a Miles’ again He will make an amazing family member. He is sweet, gentle and forgiving. Friends of Rescue had to close its doors due to lockdown but since lockdown has eased it has  dogs and  cats in its care. We have been very busy since the travel restrictions eased, whether this is down to people going back to work, we dont know, said Ms Flemming. The charity started as a rehoming blog around two and half years ago but one dog turned into five and it became a rehoming charity. Friends of Rescue now has six or seven foster families who look after rescued animals while they are treated at the vets and assessed for what type of family would suit them. If you would like to offer Miles a loving home or find out more about the charity you can visit the Friends of Rescue Facebook page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Artists and the entertainment industry as a whole have come under immense pressure since the crisis forced the closure of business and mass cancellation of events in . Derry is a city with a deep-rooted musical heritage and over recent years a superfluity of talent has emerged, each of them dferent, but making their own mark in the industry. Amongst the current crop, you’ve got young established singer-songwriter SOAK, alternative pop artist ROE, the ambient soundscapes of Elma Orkestra, three-piece punk rockers TOUTS, indie folksters Reevah and PORTS, fuzzed up alt-rockers Waldorf  Canon and all female pop-rock courtesy of CHERYM. googletag.cmd.push Then there’s the masterful Our Krypton Son, rockers Wood Burning Savages and resurgent local legends Red Organ Serpent Sound - whose gigs were once described by Eamonn McCann as ‘low instinct, high art and so sexy’ they are ‘reserved sins in certain dioceses’. Unfortunately, those musicians have been unable to entertain audiences since March, except via Zoom, which is no substitute for the interactive and much more personal live experience. For musicians, performing is their leblood, it is not only what they love to do but live shows are the most dependable source of income. Leading artists in the country recently wrote a letter to the Department for Communitiesin a plea to provide urgent financial support to save the local music industry. googletag.cmd.push It is not only the musicians but the likes of producers, sound engineers, stage crew, management, live venue staff, photographers and freelance workers in the industry who are struggling. ‘STALLED’ Speaking to the Derry News, PORTS bass player and vocalist, Steven McCool, shared the dficulties experienced during lockdown but also about the welcome prospect of festivals and gigs on the horizon as restrictions have eased. He said: “At the start of the year we had begun working on a release schedule for our first new release in four years. “This includes, making music videos, touring etc. We had been finishing the last few songs of our next album. Then came the pandemic. “All our plans were stalled. We couldnt releasewe couldnt tour. We couldnt get together to finish the album or music videos. “We play live to build up the finances to release new music so that was another wall for us. “As things have started to open up, we have been able to roll out a bit of a schedule again and with Stendhal Festival going ahead, we can use that to coincide with a release. “Hopefully now as things start to open up we can get back on-board and out playing again.”  Hannah Richardson vocalist and guitarist in CHERYMechoed Steven’s view saying it’s ‘definitely been a dficult’ time for musicians. “With no furlough, no other source of income and a lot of uncertainty surrounding when it’s safe for us to get back to work,” she explained. A grant from Help Musicians NI at the start of lockdown her going for a while, Hannah said. “Spoty and the Arts Council have also been trying to issue grants to musicians which is extremely helpful but nothing compared to what we would be bringing inwe were allowed to work, especially now around festival season. “I just hope the live music scene is able to sustain itself once we see the other side of this and hope people continue to support local musicians and music venues so we can get back as quickly and safely to doing the thing we love most,” she added. Aoe Boyle, known by her stage name Reevah , had been planning to embark on her first headline tour to accompany the release of her EP A Dferent Light in April  May, followed by a busy summer of gigs and festivals. All of these plans have now been put on the back burner. As things stand the future for the arts is very uncertain, she explained. As anindependentartist the financial impact has been quitedevastatingand has affected not only our plans for the immediate future but for the next year. However, were so aware of the vast number of artists who are in a similar or even worse positions so are trying to remain as positive as possible about the future.  SOCIAL DISTANCING Stendhal Festival captured the attention of a worldwide audience after announcing the first socially distanced festival in Northern Ireland on August - aptly named ‘UNLOCKED’. It will take place at Ballymully Cottage Farm in Limavady where numbers will be limited but the audience will be treated to the very best talent on the island as well as beer gardens, delicious food and ‘perhaps best of all, over  acres of socially distant outdoor scenic countryside to enjoy’. Most festivals have however cancelled and are already trying to regroup for next year. Bars have also begun to reopen but in an effort to maintain social distancing live music has been actively discouraged. Theatres will open their doors at the end of the month but with large gatherings prohibited and social distancing mandatory for the foreseeable future there are uncertain times ahead. Strength N.I.A and Red Organ Serpent Sound frontman, Rory Moore, said it came as a ‘hefty blow’ to find out that all of their shows were cancelled for . “Live shows go hand in hand with releasing new music and sustaining oneself as a musician both financially, spiritually and emotionally. “It has been a pretty hefty blow. But working alone and self-isolation is something I have been used to for many years, the abnormality of the situation is something that comes with the turf of being a songwriter and performer,” he reflected. “Radio and social media are very important at this time for sustaining a career in music. “We hope that our fan base will pre order our album that is set for early release in  and fingers crossed we will be out playing again towards the middle of next year.” GOVERNMENT RESPONSE The Department for Communities said it is aware of the ‘immensely challenging’ situation currently facing the local music industry. The department has been in consultation with local industry representatives and further discussions are planned in the near future. In advance of the reopening of theatres and seated venues, the DfC is working in partnership with the Arts Council NI and key stakeholders, with officials having established a Consultative Arts and Culture Recovery Forum to help them in assessing the priorities for funding the sector in its entirety. A spokesperson said: “We are currently working at pace to develop our plans to ensure the future viability and resilience of the sector. These will be published as soon as possible. “The Arts Council NI currently have open funding programmes for both inidual artists and organisations. “Theatres have been provided with an indicative date for opening of  July. It is, however, recognised that it will be some time before venues such as theatres can operate as normal.” “There are a number of reasons for this. A number of venues have indicated that it will not be economically viable to open while social distancing remains in place. “We also need to consider the additional requirements for live performances including social distancing back stage and on stage, singing and wind instruments etc. “The Arts Council also are working with the sector to develop specic guidance for reopening theatres. This should be released shortly.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Artists and the entertainment industry as a whole have come under immense pressure since the crisis forced the closure of business and mass cancellation of events in . Derry is a city with a deep-rooted musical heritage and over recent years a superfluity of talent has emerged, each of them dferent, but making their own mark in the industry. Amongst the current crop, you’ve got young established singer-songwriter SOAK, alternative pop artist ROE, the ambient soundscapes of Elma Orkestra, three-piece punk rockers TOUTS, indie folksters Reevah and PORTS, fuzzed up alt-rockers Waldorf  Canon and all female pop-rock courtesy of CHERYM. googletag.cmd.push Then there’s the masterful Our Krypton Son, rockers Wood Burning Savages and resurgent local legends Red Organ Serpent Sound - whose gigs were once described by Eamonn McCann as ‘low instinct, high art and so sexy’ they are ‘reserved sins in certain dioceses’. Unfortunately, those musicians have been unable to entertain audiences since March, except via Zoom, which is no substitute for the interactive and much more personal live experience. For musicians, performing is their leblood, it is not only what they love to do but live shows are the most dependable source of income. Leading artists in the country recently wrote a letter to the Department for Communitiesin a plea to provide urgent financial support to save the local music industry. googletag.cmd.push It is not only the musicians but the likes of producers, sound engineers, stage crew, management, live venue staff, photographers and freelance workers in the industry who are struggling. ‘STALLED’ Speaking to the Derry News, PORTS bass player and vocalist, Steven McCool, shared the dficulties experienced during lockdown but also about the welcome prospect of festivals and gigs on the horizon as restrictions have eased. He said: “At the start of the year we had begun working on a release schedule for our first new release in four years. “This includes, making music videos, touring etc. We had been finishing the last few songs of our next album. Then came the pandemic. “All our plans were stalled. We couldnt releasewe couldnt tour. We couldnt get together to finish the album or music videos. “We play live to build up the finances to release new music so that was another wall for us. “As things have started to open up, we have been able to roll out a bit of a schedule again and with Stendhal Festival going ahead, we can use that to coincide with a release. “Hopefully now as things start to open up we can get back on-board and out playing again.”  Hannah Richardson vocalist and guitarist in CHERYMechoed Steven’s view saying it’s ‘definitely been a dficult’ time for musicians. “With no furlough, no other source of income and a lot of uncertainty surrounding when it’s safe for us to get back to work,” she explained.

The governing body for ladies’ football in Derry announced details of the tournament last week and Secretary Teresa McKenna said it was only right to remember a ‘great ambassador’. “During  lockdown, Derry lost a great ambassador for our beloved sport, a player who embodied everything which is to be celebrated about ladies’ football,” she said. “The Derry LGFA Executive felt it was only fitting that we would celebrate Seonaidh’s le and influence on the game of Ladies football over many years by dedicating this special event to her memory. googletag.cmd.push “Derry LGFA are delighted that Seonaidh’s family and club have given their blessing to our request and we look forward to welcoming all our clubs back out to competitive football with this very special event.” Seonaidh Mullan lost her battle with leukaemia in April  after a brave thirteen-month fight and the Carnabhal is an opportunity for the Derry LGFA community to pay tribute to her. A mainstay in the Ballerin team, Seonaidh had played for the team since it was formed in , right up until her illness took hold last year. She dedicated a lot of time to coaching the underage ranks and became a driving force behind the growth of the sport within the club. googletag.cmd.push Seonaidh’s husband, Stephen, said the family were proud to see the Carnabhal na Peile dedicated to her memory. “Seonaidh spent many happy years playing and coaching and, even during her illness, she attended matches and was interested in what was going on within her club and county,” he said. “We are really pleased and proud that the Carnabhal na Peile will be dedicated in Seonaidhs memory and on behalf of myself, our children, Oisiacuten and Uacutena, and all of our family, I would like to thank Derry Ladies County Board for this very thoughtful gesture. Ballerin LGFC Secretary, Ursula McKillop, said the club were delighted the county board had chosen this way of celebrating Seonaidh’s le. “Alongside the many years of playing ladies football for Ballerin, Seonaidh was also our club chairperson for several years and spent many hours at the pitch coaching our underage teams,” she said. “It is very fitting that her memory is being recognised in this way. Ive no doubt she will be smiling down on us all as we take to the fields again in a few weeks’ time. “Our club would like to thank Derry Ladies County Board for remembering Seonaidh in this special way and look forward to taking part in what will be a very special Carnabhal for Seonaidhs family, friends and wider GAA family.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dara McNicholl, from Moneyneena, wowed the judges with a stirring rendition of Whitney Houston’s ‘I Have Nothing’. The Moneyneena native made his singing bow in a school play, but his modesty meant his teacher had to ring and let his parents know. “I’ve only really been singing properly for about three years,” he told viewers in the run-up to his performance. ”I just used to hum, but secretly I’d go out into the car and sing along to the radio. Getting on the stage and looking at the amount of people staring at you is much dferent to being in the car. googletag.cmd.push ”Hopefully I have what it takes to make one of the coaches turn around.”  Dara’s parents, Donna and Chris watch on proudly from the wings. In the end, proud parents Donna and Chris watched from the wings with host Emma Willis as all four judges stood up and took notice. Will. I. Am and Danny Jones spun in their seats immediately and it didn’t take long for Paloma Faith and Pixie Lott to follow suit. “You didn’t miss a note, it was crystal-clear. I was blown away by your voice and it gave me goosebumps,” said Paloma Faith afterwards. “I’m actually lost for words, because I feel like I’m in the presence of something really special. I don’t think you realise how good you are,” added Danny Jones. googletag.cmd.push Producer Will.I.Am told Dara he hoped to bring out the best in his abilities, while Pixie Lott said she like the idea of instilling confidence in him as the show progressed. In the end, the St Colm’s Ballinascreen U hurler opted for Team Paloma to take him forward in the competition.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Creggan man, who plays for Stoke City, was in the news again this week when he criticised the reaction to sectarian abuse he has faced during his career in England. The Republic of Ireland player spoke out after a number of prominent footballers recently suffered racist abuse. While condemning the abuse,McClean criticised the football authorities, his Irish team-mates and the media over their response to racist and sectarian abuse he has suffered over the years. He is regularly abused for his decision not to wear a poppy. googletag.cmd.push Does one kind of discrimination hold a higher bearing over another act of discrimination  McClean wrote this week on his Facebook page. He has received support fromSinn Feacutein Foyle MLA Martina Anderson who said more needs to be done to support the local footballer. “Its very sad that anyone would have to suffer such anti Irish racism in . I offer my support to James, Erin and their young family, she said. “Racism in any form must be challenged wherever it arises.There is no place for racism in soccer, sport or society. “I would appeal to those with influence within the sporting world to support James and his family. googletag.cmd.push “No person, in any walk of le, should have to suffer racial and sectarian abuse or intimidation. “It has been the case that James has been the subject of a witch-hunt and there has been avery vile campaign of hate against him across many s on social media. It’s totally wrong and shouldn’t be happening. There is a duty on us all to tackle racism and discrimination of any form in our communities and workplaces by challenging negative comments and behaviour.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Greyhound tells the story of aUS NavyCommander on his first war-time assignment in command of a group of vessels defending a merchant ship convoy crossing the Atlantic. The convoys destination is Liverpool, a city which also played a key role in the war. The film was released this week on Apple TV and Derry gets a number of mentions in it. This is being seen as recognition of the importance of Derry to the allied forces during the war. Its importance increased massively after the US entered the conflict. googletag.cmd.push As Derry was the first major port in Europe for ships travelling from America, it was seen as a vital location. Thousands of US soldiers were based in Derry during the war, living in several camps built in the city. During World War , Germany deployed a large number of submarines into the Atlantic to disrupt convoys of supply ships travelling between the US and Britain. Although the US convoys were protected by shore-based military aircraft when sailing near the shore, most of the voyage was in theMid-Atlantic area, known as the Black Pit beyond the range of Allied air support, where the only protection for the convoy were the assigned naval escorts. googletag.cmd.push In Greyhound, Tom Hankss character, CommanderErnest Krause, is in charge of the operation to escort a convoy of  Allied ships headed toLiverpool. The films focus alternates between the combat between the escorts and U-boats. Greyhoundwas initially scheduled to be released in cinemas in June but was delayed due to theCOVID- pandemic. The distribution rights were then sold toApple TV which released the film digitally last weekend.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The survey, which was launched last week, is seeking the views of the public and user groups to help Council plan and understand their requirements when they reopen. By participating in the survey the public will help Council identy the issues that matter to users of its leisure centre and sports facilities. All completed surveys will be entered into a draw with a chance of winning a one month All Inclusive package once the leisure facilities are up and running again. googletag.cmd.push The deadline for completing the survey has been extended to run over the weekend until Monday next. To date over  people have responded. Click here for survey  While all Council owned leisure centres currently remain closed to the public, preparations and arrangements are at an advanced stage to make the facilities safe for a phased and planned reopening. Members of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Health and Communities Committee last week approved a reopening plan and subject to elected members’ approval at Full Council later this month, details of our reopening dates will be confirmed. googletag.cmd.push A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council reassured the public that extensive work is taking place at leisure facilities across the Council to welcome the public back to its centres and sports facilities. “It is important to note that Council has to work within the NI Executive’s COVID- guidelines and our staff are workingbehind the scenes to ensure everything is in place to ensure safe workout areas, hygiene and booking facilities whilst maintaining our high standards of service. “Our priority will be to reopen our tier one centres at Foyle Arena and Templemore Sports Complex in Derry, the Riversdale Leisure Centre in Strabane and the Derg Valley Leisure Centre in Castlederg in the first instance. We are currently looking at options and safe working practices to facilitate this over the coming weeks. “We anticipate that when we do reopen, it will be with limited capacity, primarily for gym and fitness classes only and with reduced numbers of people. Bookings will need to be made in advance. Some outdoor pitches and courts are currently available for club hire only at this stage and we anticipate that it will be some time yet before we can expand our services to offer swimming and other activities.” The Council spokesperson said that as part of its planning for its phased reopening it will be embarking on a marketing campaign to provide advice, information and reassurance to the public. The public have also been advised that while sports pavilions and pitches remain closed to the public, a booking system is in place to facilitate some outdoor recreation facilities for sports clubs and sporting organisations for training purposes only. The Council has been working proactively with clubs and user groups on this over the past number of weeks and bookings are now being taken. Clubs looking for more information and keen to book the outdoor pitches are urged to fill out an online form Sports clubs can request a booking by sending a booking application form and all required supporting documentation tosportsdevelopment@derrystrabane. “This has been a very challenging time for our leisure centre users and members and we appreciate their patience and understanding at this time. We want to reassure you that the health and safety of the public and our staff are our prime concern and as we plan our phased reopening, it will require their continued patience and co-operation.” Anyone who has any queries regarding their leisure membership are urged to emailmemberships@derrystrabane. All updates relating to services and reopening will be communicated directly to members and on the ious social media s over the summer and on the website atwww.derrystrabane leisure.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One of the most familiar faces in youth football in Derry, McLaughlin has seen it all and done it all since taking the reins at the club in the early s, and in his time there has, with the help of others, elevated Celtics standing in the town to considerable heights. Yet with his partner Aisling, children Niamh , Cara , Caolan , Aaronand Rionato look out for, a degree in Community Youth Work and a job with Hillcrest Trust, Eamons plate is more than full. googletag.cmd.push The recent th anniversary celebrations of the club, plus the Covid- lockdown, gave the -year old plenty of time to reflect on both his past, and his future. So it was that McLaughlin took to Facebook earlier this week to announce his retirement, prompting hundreds of messages of support and congratulations. “It was a really dficult decision,” he admitted. “The timing however has been right for me and my family and the club. “I have been involved for  years and we have never been in a healthier position. We have more coaches than we have ever had, I think around  or  and in the last months, we have put a new committee in place, so we are in a really strong position. With that I felt the time was right for me.” googletag.cmd.push Its all a far cry from the day when he was thrust into the top position at the club, just  years of age and with little experience of coaching. “We were in the middle of a season and we had three or four matches in the league and we still had a cup run,” he recalled. “I was  years of age and I was helping Mousey Gallagher out and when he stepped away I was thrown into the deep end because there was no-one  there. “We kept it going and the likes of Oxy and Damien Doherty gave me a hand to fulfil the fixtures. We actually reached a cup final that season, but we were beaten - by Ashfield in the Brandywell. It was a brilliant season – I was hanging around with the boys as well as managing them – boys like Ryan Coyle, Eamon Morrow and Colm Fleming and a lot of those boys are now back coaching at the club, so its gone full circle for a lot of those boys as well as myself. There are so many sides to running a successful football club – but at its heart is the development of youngsters, on and off the pitch, and it is here especially where Top of the Hill has excelled according to McLaughlin. “The talent in Derry is unbelievable and thats one of the reasons I have always stuck by it,” he continued. “Its been great to see. Top of the Hill came in  years ago, but clubs like Oxford, Trojans and Don Boscos were already established. The talent is out there. For me, hand on heart, I got as much enjoyment from seeing a young fella who never got a kick as I do as someone lting a cup. Its about development. “Were slightly dferent to most clubs - because were living on the Interface, its more than about football. Im a youth worker as well so Ive always tried to tie the two in together. At this time of year we would have had trips and interventions to keep young people off the streets and away from rioting. “I got a text the other day from a young fella in Claudy saying that, more than football, he missed the trips we would do through The Whistle and Hillcrest. Its brilliant to hear that its not just about football because there are only so many young fellas who will make it as footballers. Its the community spirit and its the family atmosphere and I hope that continues on. Thats a big thing for me.” Celtic have had their share of big names come through their ranks in McLaughlins time – Rory Holden , Josh Daniels, Michael McCrudden and Darren McCauley some of those to build careers in the game.  Current Derry City midfielder Jack Malone also has his roots in Top of the Hill and McLaughlin admits that seeing a player reach his potential is the best kind of reward. It was in fact, McCruddens transfer to Newcastle United  years ago, coinciding with the tragic death of friend and fellow coach Keith Roddy, which lit a fire in McLaughlin. “Michael, at  or , was the first ever Top of the Hill Celtic player to go across the water,” he explained. “At the same time, in , Mickeys mentor, Keith Oxy Roddyhad died, and at that point I made the conscious decision that Im grabbing this by the horns and take the club where it needs to be, with the help of the likes of Paddy Logue, Higgs, Gerard Dunlop and boys like that.  “There were a very small amount of coaches but we had teams at every age group. You were out five or six nights a week. In the last two or three years, that has changed because now we have two or three coaches at every age group. I dont know for the le of me how Jon Clford and boys like that did it on their own. They deserve every credit that they get. “When I was starting out, boys like Jon Clford and Noel Crampsey, thats the boys you spoke to and asked advice of. Even though they were your competitors on the pitch, they wrere all in it for the same reasons, and they guided me, but no-one more so than Mickey Hutton in the DD. Any problems that I had ever with football, he was at the end of the phone, and the support that the DD have given us as a club hasnt gone unnoticed over here.”  is the first year that the Foyle Cup has not run in the city since its inception in , and while it is a loss for every club throughout the city, McLaughlin cannot wait for its– with the tournament holding a special place in the Top of the Hill calendar. “We try to get at least one team in every age grouppossible,” he said. “Some teams arent great, some are better than others, but they still get the opportunity to play in the Foyle Cup, and that, for me, is amazing. If youre winning - or getting beat -, your family are there supporting you during the Foiyle Cup, savouring the atmosphere and meeting new people. The buzz about the whole city throughout the week is phenomenal.” His time with Top of the Hill, for now, has reached an end, but the green and white will remain in his blood, and when football s, he will likely be the first on the sidelines cheering on his team. “Top of the Hill has been my le for  years, without a shadow of a doubt,” he stated.  “Its meant absolutely everything and will continue to mean everything to me. “It has given me some amazing memories and it will always be one of the proudest things that Ive done in my le. “Without the help and support of so many people – even the likes of my mother and sister, it all runs in their veins. Seeing the club celebrate its th anniversary last year probably sparked off my thinking that maybe it was time to move this on. The Covid thing gave me time to reflect and think – we are in a healthy spot at the minute and we need to have every faith in the boys who are going to take up the baton and run with it. “The amount of coaches we have now is credit to where people see us. You mightnt be as big a club as Tristar or Oxford, but were well up there. The respect that Top of the Hill Celtic has throughout the city is phenomenal.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Many businesses had to close for over three months as a result of coronavirus lockdown measures and are on the slow road to recovery.

They bind communities together, mitigate against isolation and provide something close to an essential service. It is unthinkable that they would be allowed to collapse.Mr OrsquoToole, who is a former Downing Street press officer, says he also favours a tax on the internet giants.ldquoA number of months ago, I wrote to the Executive to ask them to initiate work on my action plan, which includes a rates holiday for local newspapers, prioritising local media in advertising spend, committing to a poundm journalism fund and to press the British Government to institute a digital information levy on social media giants such as Facebook and Google, he said.The MLA added: ldquoI welcomed the opportunity to engage with the finance minister where I pressed upon him the importance of committing to act to save this vital industry.

We had the most beautul Art Deco Vaudeville theatre for celebrities, actors and directors to view their work. So I always loved it and knew I wanted to create something like that when it came todesigning the cinema, explained Jacqueline.Jacqueline reeled in her professional interior design skills, repurposing household items and getting inspiration from the dance showrsquos judgesrsquo table for her home cinema.She said: ldquoTony and I moved back home from London and built our home where we had a basement constructed. But it became a storage area and the kids were sitting more or less in the middle of it.ldquoWe drove up to Belfast and got wadding to line the walls. When we ran out of wadding, we just used old duvets. We covered the wadding with red velvet. That made the room soundproof.ldquoWe are cocooned watching a movie and a massive thunder storm would pass without us even hearing it. Tony did the building work by and the kids helped. We called them the film crew.ldquoI also got gold paint and mixed that with glitter to give the old-style feel of the movie room. We made a bar thatrsquos inspired by the judgesrsquo  table on Strictly Come Dancing. I was watching the show one night and thought Irsquod like to make something like that.The Art Deco-style columns were Billy bookcases from Ikea that we painted. I had a mirror bought for me that needed a place to hang it and we put that in the bar where it really suits. A relative bought us a popcorn machine for added authenticity.She said that from creating the mood board for the project to when it was completed took four weeks, but it really was not used until lockdown.ldquoBefore the Covid- restrictions, the cinema was something we had started and used a bit. When lockdown came and the cinemas closed, the kids were never out of our cinema, she said.ldquoThe kids can go in there and watch their Netflix and Disney Plus mdash we have Sky, Netflix and every other movie and plus channel going now during lockdown so we can get the newly released movies as they are streamed.ldquoNow therersquos so much satisfaction with it. Itrsquos something special we designed and built as a family and now use as a family. Itrsquos a special place because we all have invested our time, love and effort into it.However, there are no plans to rule out trips to the cinema after they are allowed to reopen.Jacqueline added: ldquoWe will continue to support our local cinema. Our home cinema is great but therersquos nothing like the real thingThe movie theatre, whether it be modern or old-style, is a magical place and I hope we all continue going to the movies and supporting our cinemas for many years to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Tributes paid to former council chairman  ","story":"GLOWING tributes have been paid to former SDLP councillor Patsy Toman who sadly passed away last week.

He was a principled man who helped everyone, regardless of their politics and always stood up for what he believed to be right.A passionate defender of the Ballynahinch electoral area, he lobbied hard to secure investment and was a key player in the drive to secure a new bypass around the market town.Mr Toman made a signicant contribution to the district and a number of organisations, including Loughinisland GAC. He was the clubrsquos former cultural officer and treasurer.Leading the tributes to her friend and former council colleague, Lady Ritchie said the community of Loughinisland and further afield had lost a man of ldquoimmeasurable integrity and the epitome of hard work and resilience.

I can recall Patsy working in that shop and sometimes he delivered our groceries, she recalled.ldquoIn our many conversations, he recalled those visits and how I was only ever interested in the lemonade bottles that were in the grocery box. At that early stage of his le, Patsy was in a hurry and, above all, he was super efficient to get the job done. His attention to detail was legendary.Lady Ritchie said that she next met Mr Toman at a meeting of the SDLPrsquos Down District Executive in Dundrum in June .ldquoPatsy obviously knew who I was because he asked meI was still in Belfast.

He was a member of Ballynahinch Credit Union, Magherlegan Pipe Band, the Monday Club in Drumaness and Loughinisland GAC, as well as numerous organisations associated with the former Down Council. Patsy was a true Gael and was involved in the cultural and Scor activities of his home club.ldquoWhen I worked with the late Eddie McGrady MP, Patsy used to call into the Downpatrick constituency office every Monday and would have met up with the late Cllr Peter Craig.ldquoThere was fierce rivalry between the Saul and Loughinisland GAA teams and those matches were fought out again in the Scotch Street office and latterly in Saul Street, with Patsy and Peter also glorying in the fortunes of the Down GAA team in the early s.Lady Ritchie said Mr Toman always put the needs of people first, with this clearly reflected in the background work he did on behalf of the Loughinisland families following the  massacre at The Heights Bar in the village.ldquoPatsy was shaken with emotion and grief about the killing of six innocent men and the images of that night on June  lasted with him until he was overtaken by his illness and his untimely death. He always stood solidly with the families in their fight for justice and truth, she continued.Lady Ritchie said Mr Toman was involved in the politics of the SDLP for a long time and was a founder member and chairman of the partyrsquos Drumaness branch.He was elected to Down Council in  and subsequently re-elected in , , ,  and  and while he retired from elected politics in , he remained active in the community.ldquoPatsy was a stalwart on the East Border Region Committee and the Ards Down Rural Partnership, continued Lady Ritchie.ldquoI fought many elections with him and he kept driving everyone to go the extra mile to achieve better representation. AndPatsy had an issue that required a resolution, he pursued you until he got an answer, applying that same approach for all of his constituents.Lady Ritchie said Mr Toman had been a ldquotrue, loyal friend for many years and was delighted and honoured to attend his th birthday celebrations in April of last year.ldquoPatsy always confronted you with his political problems which were not major at all. Such was the loyalty and bond between Patsy and myself that whenever I was ill with breast cancer, both he and his we Anne arranged a special Mass for me the day before my surgery. I will never forget that and I am eternally grateful to Patsy and Anne for their personal support to me during my political and personal le, she added.She added: ldquoPatsy was an extremely loyal inidual a family man who cherished his we, children and grandchildren.

In order for staff and guests to enjoy a safe cinema trip, Omniplex have implemented a range of new measures including: * Pre-Booking of tickets – to control the number of patrons in foyers and auditoriums, tickets need to be booked online. * In-Cinema Seat Separation – the system will dynamically lock empty seats around your booking so you can sit next to your friends but will be distanced from others * Limited capacity – they are limiting the number of guests at any time in the foyer and screen capacities will reduce by over % * Enhanced cleaning regimes – including screens and all customer touchpoints. Guests will find sanitisation stations in each of their cinemas * Reduced showtimes – only one movie will start every  minutes to facilitate social distancing and extra cleaning. These policies will be adapted in line with official guidance. Paul John Anderson, director of Omniplex Cinemas said: We’re delighted to be finally re-opening our cinemas over the next few weeks with a selection of popular classic movies. Guests will notice some dferences during their trip like checking in with a host on entry, directional signage and self-scanning of e-tickets. Also, for the first few weeks tickets will also only be sold online so we can limit the number of guests per show”. Excited cinema-goers will be able to book tickets online at Omniplex.ie  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eabeedd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ccabfecbcfccd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1594907543060.jpg--fundraiser_for_the_late_declan_grimes_raises_almost__7_000.jpg?159490754300","title":"fundraiser for the late declan grimes raises almost   ","story":"A virtual concert held in memory of Carrickmore man Declan Grimes, who passed away from Covid- earlier this year, has raised almost pound, for the Western Trust.Singer song-writer Ciara Fox, from Greencastle, organised a virtual concert in memory of Mr Grimes who sadly passed away in the Critical Care Unit at the South West Acute Hospital, Enniskillen, in April this year.
