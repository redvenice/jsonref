Monroe: She shot to fame as a teenager due to her famous father, director Dario Argento, and roles in a number of Italian movies          Dietrich and DiMaggio:           Marlon Brando: Argento had won the Italian equivalent of the Oscar twice before the age of 20 and went on to try her luck in the US          Jimmy Dean: Argento briefly found fame in America with her role opposite Vin Diesel in XXX in the early aughts          On the cover of a magazine: She has appeared in a number of films over the past decade, most notably Marie Antoinette, Boarding Gate, The Last Mistress and Mother of Tears          Grace Kelly: In 2014 she premiered her film Misunderstood at the Cannes Film Festival, which she wrote and directed, telling the press that she was done with acting          Harlow, Jean: Bourdain was a fan of the film, which he called \u0027remarkable and beautiful,\u0027 and is a big fan of Argento\u0027s dad          Picture of a beauty queen: After the two met, Bourdain posted a pic of Dario with his young daughter on Twitter, writing: \u0027Happy Birthday to the master\u0027\u0027Are you the queen?\u0027 Theodora\u0027s cheeky question to FergiePrincess Beatrice

I have sometimes had very bad thoughts, depression is a very serious mental illness and sometimes alien thoughts come,\u0027 she said  Meaning: \u0027The instinct to die is inhumane. He did not think of anyone at that moment, because his pain was immense, but I had never seen him. How did he hide it like that?\u0027 asked Argento on the Italian TV show (above in a Roman park earlier this month)          Emotional: Argento said: \u0027I\u0027ve never had a person like that. He took care of me and my children. He left me a void that nothing can fill, this pain never goes away\u0027  Fan: \u0027There are no messages in the morning, and in the evening there is no one to say goodnight to me. I have no more strength,\u0027 said Argento          Struggle: \u0027If I\u0027m not well, I can not take care of my children. There are days that I can not get out of bed.

It\u0027s not even a question @AsiaArgento just defended it. There is no debate. No doubt.\u0027Veronesi\u0027s fiancee also quickly jumped to Argentos\u0027 defense with a post on Instagram.      \u0027Are you the queen?\u0027 Theodora\u0027s cheeky question to FergiePrincess Beatrice helps Princess Eugenie into Aston MartinMeghan Markle appears to eye roll Prince Harry at Eugenie\u0027s wedding\u0027Love at first sight\u0027: Princess Eugenie opens up about husband-to-beKate Moss and Liv Tyler arrive for Eugenie\u0027s royal weddingWilliam, Kate, Harry and Meghan arrive at royal weddingDuchess of York Sarah Ferguson makes royal wedding arrivalSealed with a kiss! Princess Eugenie and Jack leave chapelPrincess Eugenie arrives at chapel in Peter Pilotto dressArmy sends wedding wishes to Princess Eugenie and Jack BrooksbankThe post shows a photo of an irate Argento flipping the bird. It was taken in 2013 during the Cannes film festival.Solarino appeared to be sending a message to her fellow countrymen and women over their lack of support for Argento.Solarino\u0027s caption, which was written in Italian, read: \u0027We have reversed the facts so as not to see them.\u0027Violence, stupidity, ignorance, the superficiality of comments that I read or listen to leave me speechless.\u0027Solarino then relayed a message from Argento which read: \u0027This middle finger is for those Italians - I repeat: Italians, who accuse me of having sought the violence suffered by a girl because I have not run away and because I have not reported before.\u0027It\u0027s the fault of people like you if women are afraid to tell the truth.\u0027From the rest of the world I receive only words of solidarity and comfort, in my country I am called a b****.          Argento did not dispute Dove\u0027s claims in that tweet, and instead accused the model of deflecting, before adding: \u0027Don’t call me love. All that is left of your answers is treachery and deceit.\u0027She later closed out her attack by writing: \u0027You can’t help yourself but keep lying, can you? You never sent me or showed me any documents. And remember, there was a witness.\u0027Dove went offline at the exact same time, but not before posting a few final remarks.\u0027Ok, through the gates of Hell I walk willingly with You if only for the truth to see the light of the fire,\u0027 said the model to Argento in one post.Dove then said in a final tweet: \u0027Fair for U to be angry- U are trapped and want to take everything down with U. I am not afraid of what is coming. But the truth still remains You slept w Jimmy Bennett. You lied when You demand others accused of sexual assault to be honest. This hurts victims’ voices everywhere.\u0027The model is a new acquaintance of Argento, whom she met through McGowan.Dove started dating the actress earlier this year in the wake of McGowan\u0027s rage-filled rant at a transgender woman at a New York City book signing for her memoir Brave that many found to be transphobic.In the wake of that incident, Dove offered to help the actress repair her image.Dove said that she released the texts with McGowan\u0027s blessing, and also sent her exchanges with the actress to the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u0027s Department. "},{"url":null,"title":"Family seven BULLDOZE brand new luxury home council says 2 5ft HIGH","story":"    Mr Asif Naseem\u0027s new-build home in Lightwood, Staffordshire, could be bulldozed after councillors decided to back enforcement action.

When they started building it, it ripped my house to pieces. \u0027It was horrendous the whole house shook.

I think for the people it overlooks, it\u0027s bigger than it should have been, and I imagine that\u0027s quite intrusive.\u0027But six councillors decided not to grant another reprieve. Councillor David Evans said: \u0027People want a solution, but I do think we have deferred enforcement action already and I wasn\u0027t happy about that then. \u0027We should take action. I\u0027m not happy with the deferral. If you build a building without permission you are risking any investment you spend. No authority should be pressured into giving permission because it has already been built.\u0027I have sympathy for the family but we need to look at the impact on the families surrounding them.

So many families have lost everything. This hurricane was an absolute monster.\u0027 Michael was a Category 4 storm, just shy of a rare Category 5, when it came ashore. It was downgraded to a Tropical Storm on Thursday as it took its drenching rains to Georgia and the Carolinas.Though weakened into a tropical storm, it continued to bring heavy rain and blustery winds to the Southeast as it pushed inland, soaking areas still recovering from last month\u0027s Hurricane Florence. Parts of North Carolina and Virginia could get as much as 9 inches of rain and flash floods.Under a perfectly clear blue sky, Florida families emerged tentatively from darkened shelters and hotels to an unfamiliar and perilous landscape of shattered homes and shopping centers, beeping security alarms, wailing sirens and hovering helicopters. The full extent of the damage was only slowly becoming clear, with some of the worst areas difficult to reach. An 80-mile stretch of Interstate 10, the main east-west route along the Panhandle, was closed because of debris.Scott said the National Guard got into Mexico Beach and rescued 20 people who survived the direct hit.It was not yet known what had happened to about 280 residents of Mexico Beach who authorities said had ignored evacuation orders as the storm approached the state\u0027s northwest. The town was under a mandatory evacuation order as the rapidly developing storm closed in, but some people were determined to ride it out.     Rescuers searched the Mexico Beach area on Thursday morning after the hurricane made a direct hit on the small town          Lee Cathey, 37, Al Cathey, 71, and Charles Smith, 56, survey damage in the coastal township of Mexico Beach          Boats washed up among the debris of houses in Mexico Beach on Thursday following the devastating hurricane          Firefighter Austin Schlarb performs a door to door search in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael in Mexico Beach Thursday          Jim Bob looks out on the destruction caused as Hurricane Michael passed through the area in Mexico Beach          Bianna Kelsay was rescued from her home in Mexico Beach on Thursday as crews went door to door looking for people          People hold hands as they walk amidst destruction in Mexico Beach in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael\u0027Are you the queen?\u0027 Theodora\u0027s cheeky question to FergiePrincess Beatrice helps Princess Eugenie into Aston MartinMeghan Markle appears to eye roll Prince Harry at Eugenie\u0027s wedding\u0027Love at first sight\u0027: Princess Eugenie opens up about husband-to-beKate Moss and Liv Tyler arrive for Eugenie\u0027s royal weddingWilliam, Kate, Harry and Meghan arrive at royal weddingDuchess of York Sarah Ferguson makes royal wedding arrivalSealed with a kiss!

You want to check on things, and begin the recovery process (but) we have to make sure things are safe.\u0027Meanwhile, the Coast Guard said it rescued at least 27 people, mostly from homes damaged along the Florida coastline, and searched for more victims. Among those brought to safety were nine people rescued by helicopter from a bathroom of their Panama City home after their roof collapsed.Thousands of National Guard troops, law enforcement officers and medical teams are working their way into damaged communities to search for survivors.Florida officials also said they were moving patients from damaged health care facilities. The largest hospitals in Panama City shut down and evacuated hundreds of patients due to heavy hurricane damage. Bay Medical Sacred Heart was moving about 200 patients from buildings with blown-out windows, a cracked exterior wall and a collapsed roof.  More than 375,000 people up and down the Gulf Coast were ordered or urged to evacuate as Michael closed in. But it moved so fast and intensified so quickly that people didn\u0027t have much time to prepare, and emergency authorities lamented that many ignored the warnings. A Red Cross official said it\u0027s possible that as many as 320,000 people on Florida\u0027s Gulf Coast did not evacuate and likely rode out the storm.  President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for all of Florida, freeing federal assistance to supplement state and local disaster responses.About 3,500 Florida National Guard troops were deployed, along with more than 1,000 search-and-rescue personnel to the area immediately after the hurricane hit.   \u0027Are you the queen?\u0027 Theodora\u0027s cheeky question to FergiePrincess Beatrice helps Princess Eugenie into Aston MartinMeghan Markle appears to eye roll Prince Harry at Eugenie\u0027s wedding\u0027Love at first sight\u0027: Princess Eugenie opens up about husband-to-beKate Moss and Liv Tyler arrive for Eugenie\u0027s royal weddingWilliam, Kate, Harry and Meghan arrive at royal weddingDuchess of York Sarah Ferguson makes royal wedding arrivalSealed with a kiss!

The city took the brunt of Michael, feeling the full force of its 155mph winds on Wednesday afternoon Sarah Radney, an 11-year-old, was visiting her grandparents\u0027 home when Hurricane Michael roared into southwest Georgia. She and her siblings were there on a fall break. Her parents decided cautiously to let them stay as Michael approached because they thought the home was powerful enough to withstand the storm.  If the family feared anything, it was probably falling trees - not a carport next to the house.In what could only be described as a freak accident, authorities say Michael\u0027s powerful winds lifted the portable structure high into the air and slammed it back down on the house.           Florida Governor Rick Scott talks with residents as they return to Mexico Beach on Friday.

So many families have lost everything,\u0027 he said.In a tweet, he described the damage as \u0027unprecedented\u0027. \u0027The damage we have seen from Michael is indescribable and unprecedented for the Panhandle. I have activated the Emergency Bridge Loan Program for small businesses damaged during Hurricane Michael so they can get back to work as soon as possible,\u0027 he said. An 80-mile stretch of Interstate 10, the main east-west route along the Panhandle, was closed.Some of the worst damage was in Mexico Beach, where the hurricane crashed ashore Wednesday as a Category 4 monster with 155mph winds and a storm surge of 9 feet.    The storm has claimed the lives of 13 people, including 11-year-old Sarah Radney (pictured), who was tragically killed in Georgia. She was killed when a carport smashed into their home and struck her in the head. Fire Lt. Brad Clark was killed in Virginia when a tractor trailer smashed into his fire engine on the highway Dawn Vickers, who decided to stay to ride out the storm but was forced to flee her home and take shelter in a condo, described it as the \u0027worst nightmare\u0027 of her life.  \u0027I don\u0027t even know if I have the words to describe it. It\u0027s been the worst nightmare I\u0027ve ever been through in my life.\u0027I feel we will. It\u0027s very tough right now. They brought us here and left us at what was the gas station. We ran into some people who had a condo that was higher and dryer. \u0027My home was taken off the foundation, cracked into, and was floating away with my cars,\u0027 she told CNN. Video from a drone revealed widespread devastation across the town of about 1,000 people.As thousands of National Guard troops, law enforcement officers and medical teams fanned out, the governor pleaded with people in the devastated areas to stay away for now because of hazards that included fallen trees and power lines.\u0027I know you just want to go home. You want to check on things and begin the recovery process,\u0027 Scott said. But \u0027we have to make sure things are safe.\u0027The Coast Guard said it rescued at least 27 people before and after the hurricane came ashore, mostly from homes along the Florida coastline, and searched for more victims.Among those brought to safety were nine people rescued by helicopter from a bathroom of their home in hard-hit Panama City after their roof collapsed, Petty Officer 3rd Class Ronald Hodges said.A dramatic video shows the moment members of the United States Coast Guard rescues a trapped woman in Florida. \u0027Are you the queen?\u0027 Theodora\u0027s cheeky question to FergiePrincess Beatrice helps Princess Eugenie into Aston MartinMeghan Markle appears to eye roll Prince Harry at Eugenie\u0027s wedding\u0027Love at first sight\u0027: Princess Eugenie opens up about husband-to-beKate Moss and Liv Tyler arrive for Eugenie\u0027s royal weddingWilliam, Kate, Harry and Meghan arrive at royal weddingDuchess of York Sarah Ferguson makes royal wedding arrivalSealed with a kiss!

No patients were hurt, the hospital said.The state mental hospital in Chattahoochee, which has a section for the criminally insane, was cut off by land, and food and supplies were being flown in, authorities said. Landlines and cellphones also were down to the complex, which has nearly 1,000 residents and more than 300 staff. They relied on emergency radios to make contact with first responders.About two million ready-to-eat meals, one million gallons of water and 40,000 10-pound bags of ice are ready for distribution in Florida. As the storm made its way inland, it caused havoc in Georgia, spinning off possible tornadoes and taking down power lines and trees. Forecasters said it could drop up to seven inches of rain over the Carolinas and Virginia before pushing out to sea Thursday night.In North Carolina\u0027s mountains, motorists had to be rescued from cars trapped by high water.\u0027For North Carolina, Michael isn\u0027t as bad as Florence, but it adds unwelcome insult to injury, so we must be on alert,\u0027 Gov Roy Cooper said.Fast-moving Michael left North Carolina behind with rivers rising and more than 600,000 households in the dark.Cooper\u0027s office said the power outages were concentrated in central North Carolina\u0027s Piedmont region, as trees and power lines toppled under the pressure of winds of up to 60mph. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/22/4CFD440600000578-0-image-m-18_1528322245125.jpg","title":"Paul Dacre defends need strong press London Press Club ball","story":"    Former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre spoke about the importance of having a strong press after he became the first ever \u0027journalist laureate\u0027 at the London Press Club\u0027s annual ball last nightHe said his father, Peter, was chairman of the Press Club between 1975 and 1976, while he himself was working in Washington for the Daily Express.\u0027It seems almost remarkable that back then journalism tools included carbon paper, scissors and glue, while in the print rooms and newspaper offices molten lead glistened in buckets,\u0027 he said.\u0027Well today Mail Online, a total digital operation, is the world\u0027s biggest newspaper website.\u0027So, yes, much water has flown through the river Fleet since those days – and print journalism has had to cross many perilous bridges.\u0027Mr Dacre predicted a positive future for responsible journalism, although he cited the recent death of a Saudi journalist as an example of the threats to the trade.\u0027Yes Fleet Street is going through a challenging time at the moment, but I promise mankind\u0027s need for information… is as old as time itself,\u0027 he said.Mail\u0027s Editor to take up new role as Lord Rothermere pays...Geordie Greig will take over as the new Editor of the Daily...A great week for Mail newspapers: Daily Mail and Mail on...Share this article"},{"url":null,"title":"Family seven BULLDOZE brand new luxury home council says 2 5ft HIGH","story":"    Mr Asif Naseem\u0027s new-build home in Lightwood, Staffordshire, could be bulldozed after councillors decided to back enforcement action.

Doria, you may remember, was elegant and understated in soft mint Fergie chose a vivid shade of eye-catching emerald and a winged look-at-me hat.From the moment she arrived, beaming like the Cheshire Cat, she was every inch the incorrigible, rumbustious Fergie of legend, whose behaviour has been a staple pain in the royal backside.Yes, this was Eugenie\u0027s \u0027Big Day\u0027 (and didn\u0027t she look gorgeous in her Peter Pilotto dress, arguably better cut and pitched than Meghan\u0027s boat-necked Givenchy number?) but it was also without doubt Fergie\u0027s \u0027Moment\u0027, the culmination of her long walk back from the wilderness. Prince Philip\u0027s presence despite his great age of 97 (it would have been the easiest thing in the world for him to plead illness and skip the whole thing altogether) and famously not her greatest fan, must have been the cherry on the cake.Behind the scenes, of course, Fergie\u0027s rehabilitation has long been widely accepted.

Demi Moore!’ cried Eamonn, expressing the mild surprise we all felt as the Hollywood actress known for her devotion to beauty-enhancing surgeries suddenly appeared.Who even knew that the star of Ghost and Indecent Proposal was friends with the Yorks? She certainly didn’t get the memo that this was a plastic-free wedding, and drifted into the chapel with her usual waxen expression fixed in place.On and on they came Pixie Geldof channelling Halloween in her Corpse Bride pleats actress Liv Tyler appearing to have stepped from the pages of a Chandler novel in her blocky suit tiny Cara Delevingne in her top hat and tails, looking like the ringmaster of a toy circus.Among their number was a fruity cache of former druggies and good-time guys and gals, the kind of demi-famous derelicts who once put the ouch in louche. Who were these people?Along with Kate there was Naomi Campbell, Jimmy Carr, Jamie Redknapp, the pop star Ricky Martin, pop singer Ellie Goulding, professional posh wedding attender James Blunt, orcee Heather Kerzner, artist Tracey Emin, his eminence Stephen Fry, broadcaster Richard Bacon, heiress Tamara Beckwith, always-the-bridesmaid Chelsy Davy, the Bransons, the Pippas, Uncle Tom Cobbleigh and of course Robbie Williams and his wife Ayda, fresh from adjudicating on The X Factor.

Certainly, they all behaved nicely when Andrea Bocelli got up to sing, although they couldn’t have known that the first TV ad break featured a crass advertisement for his ‘first album in 14 years’.A stray ribbon of bad taste fluttered across the proceedings. Armani tweeted details of Robbie Williams’s suit and his wife’s outfit, while even the groom’s employers revealed details of the brand of tequila being served at the reception. Back in the studio, Eamonn and Ruth endlessly discussed the bride’s scoliosis, in a section called Princess Eugenie’s Health Battle.Do you know something? She is not the only one to have suffered. Take Eamonn, for example. ‘I was born with my hips in the wrong place. In my whole life I could never spread my legs,’ he said. Thanks for sharing, big guy.Still, it was hard not to be moved by the sheer happiness of the occasion. The rosy-cheeked bride who beamed with joy, the groom at her side who gasped for breath like a gaffed salmon, occasionally overwhelmed with the emotion of it all. Where was Queenie now? Just like Eamonn and Ruth, she did her duty and then she went home. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db00c1e11c83b83a5f324b17cbe785a02060529b/19_595_3806_2284/master/3806.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ba236c362e7b7ddc122e2a1961ced54","title":"alternative nobel literature prize maryse conde new academy prize","story":"The New Academy prize, organised to fill the gap left by the cancellation of 2018’s official award, goes to Guadeloupean novelist Guadeloupean novelist Maryse Condé has been announced as the winner of the New Academy prize in literature, a one-off award intended to fill the void left by the cancellation of this year’s scandal-dogged Nobel prize for literature.Speaking on a video played at a ceremony in Stockholm, Condé said she was “very happy and proud” to win the award. “But please allow me to share it with my family, my friends and above all the people of Guadeloupe, who will be thrilled and touched seeing me receive this prize,” she said. “We are such a small country, only mentioned when there are hurricanes or earthquakes and things like that. Now we are so happy to be recognised for something else.”The author of some 20 novels, including Desirada, Segu and Crossing the Mangrove, Condé is, according to the chair of judges Ann Pålsson, a “grand storyteller” who “belongs to world literature”.“She describes the ravages of colonialism and the post-colonial chaos in a language which is both precise and overwhelming,” Pålsson said. “The dead live in her stories closely to the living in a … world where gender, race and class are constantly turned over in new constellations.”The winner was announced at a Stockholm library – a stark contrast to the baroque splendour of the Swedish Academy – after a three-fold judging process. Unlike the secretive deliberations of the Nobel jury, the New Academy prize saw Swedish librarians nominate authors, who were winnowed down to a final four by a public vote, the winner decided by an expert jury.The initial four finalists had been reduced to three after Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami withdrew last month, citing a desire to “concentrate on his writing, away from media attention”. Murakami is often cited as a frontrunner for the Nobel.The New Academy, backed by more than 100 Swedish cultural figures, was set up in response to the scandal that engulfed the prestigious Swedish Academy earlier this year, when it emerged that the husband of one of the academy members had been accused of sexual assault. The accusations prompted a wave of resignations from the Swedish Academy, with this year’s award cancelled “in view of … reduced public confidence”. The man at the centre of the scandal, Jean-Claude Arnault, was convicted of rape and sentenced to two years in prison in a Stockholm court last week.The Swedish-Greek journalist and author Alexandra Pascalidou, who helped found the New Academy prize, said she was not alone in feeling “embarrassed and frustrated” about the scandal.“Why was literature, why were authors, going to pay the price, be punished, for what they did?” she said. “So I started calling friends and colleagues and people I met that were crazy enough to believe, to have a vision, to think that we can change what we cannot accept.”Pascalidou said that hundreds of libraries had nominated and almost 33,000 members of the public had voted for the prize. “That was amazing, and this shows the strength of collective effort. This shows there are so many people dedicated to culture and literature.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/841fcdae3ce9eb2bd057cab2f65724cd935e4e50/0_73_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ead89c3f2a792ff94856444851b82dc8","title":"neil gaiman margaret atwood graveyard book","story":"What’s the point of life without death? The author of The Handmaid’s Tale salutes Gaiman’s shadow sideOnce, during an on stage discussion of the type literary festivals go in for, I frightened Neil Gaiman by channelling the voice of the Wicked Witch of the West from the film The Wizard of Oz. “And your little dog, too!” I cackled. “No! No! Don’t do that!” cried Neil. He then explained that he had been petrified by this green-tinted witch as an eight-year-old. Behold: a literary influence had been discovered!The best children’s writers are, somewhere deep in their psyches, still eight years old. They know what is scary. They remember what it was like to have your hand plunged into a Halloween bowl of peeled grapes in a darkened room, having been told they were eyeballs. They relish the delights of being terrified in song and story. They understand the benefits of imaginary horror: yes, this is frightening, but ultimately it can be dealt with, at least in fictional form.Gaiman brought himself up right. He read a great many books proper to his future calling, and absorbed their memes and lessons. When advised to direct his feet to the sunny side of the street, he did – he does not write tragedies – but he also directed them to the shadow side for, as Ursula K Le Guin so memorably put it: “Only in silence the word,  Only in dark the light,  Only in dying life:  Bright the hawk’s flight  On the empty sky.” Or as Beatrix Potter demonstrated, no fun robbing the radishes from Mr McGregor’s garden unless the rabbit-pie dish hovers as a threat. What’s the point of being “Alive, alive, oh” unless you also risk being dead as a doorknob? (Though we must reserve judgment about those doorknobs, in view of A Christmas Carol.)Astrologically, Gaiman is a Scorpio with Gemini rising and, if you go in for that sort of thing – as he must, because I found his horoscope online – this explains much. Scorpio is governed by Pluto, patron of the Underworld as well as of plumbing, underwear, the criminal underworld and everything below the line. Gemini is ruled by Mercury or Hermes: god of thieves, jokes, communication, travel and secrets in addition to which he is the conductor of souls to the Underworld. Most travel to the land of the dead is one-way, but Hermes comes and goes as he pleases, and so do various protagonists in books by Gaiman, including The Graveyard Book.Most of us have a distinct aversion to being dead. We have great difficulty imagining ourselves as simply not existing any more: even the sentence “I will be dead” contains an “I”. So where will the “I” be when the “dead” phase kicks in? There have been a great many answers to that question over time: in a dusty underworld (Mesopotamia) in a complex, many-chambered afterlife, supposing your heart passes its weighing-in test against the Feather of Truth (ancient Egypt) in the asphodel-bestrewn but tedious Elysian Fields, if a Greek hero in Hell, Purgatory, Paradise or Heaven, if an early-Renaissance Christian in the territories of the dead after your journey on the three-day road (indigenous North America), or in the inventive goth worlds of Tim Burton, such as the one in Corpse Bride or in the frolicsome Mexican Day of the Dead realm of the recent Pixar film Coco.But there are many other possibilities. You could – for instance – become a vampire: neither alive nor dead. You could become a ghoul: alive in a way, but consuming dead bodies. Or you could become a ghost: there but not there, visible sometimes but invisible at other times, and frequently spotted in graveyards.It is this latter body of folklore that Gaiman draws on for The Graveyard Book. The hero of his tale begins as a toddler who climbs out of the window while his parents are being murdered and makes his way uphill to the neighbourhood cemetery, where some of the resident spirits – prompted by the fleeting appearance of his ghostly mother – elect to adopt him. Since they don’t know his name, they call him “Nobody” (“Bod” for short), reminding us of the ruse practised by the wily Ulysses during his escape from that pesky Cyclops. So useful to be able to answer “Nobody” when asked who you are.The graveyard in question is very old and contains many layers of time – Celtic, ancient Roman, many centuries of English – so Bod learns different kinds of writing from the tombstones and a lot about history from the inhabitants. There is a misadventure when he tries to go to a real school – he doesn’t exactly fit in – but his persecutors are satisfactorily foiled.It’s customary for heroes to be educated in unorthodox ways – by a centaur, for instance, like Achilles, or by a wizard, like King Arthur. It’s also not unusual for them to have dead parents and strange powers, like Harry Potter.The Graveyard Book is a bildungsroman – a novel about a protagonist’s education – in which Nobody’s unusual tutors are a collection of ghosts, a vampire and a female werewolf, and the strange powers are supernatural abilities granted by the dead people who live (as it were) in the graveyard.This situation has come about because of the deadness of Nobody’s parents at the hands of a collection of arch enemies, all of whom are called Jack, though with different surnames. They are the “jacks of all trades” – Jack Tar, Jack (Be) Nimble, Jack Frost … The other term for a “Jack” in a deck of cards is a knave, and a knave can also be a villain. And so it is in The Graveyard Book, for the Jacks belong to an ancient and powerful order, and Nobody is one of those fabled children tagged by a prophecy – in his case a prophecy that he will mean the end of the Jacks. You can see why they would seek to put an end to him.But when you have as a  a suave vampire like Silas – boundary keeper of the graveyard and obliterator of memories, and able to come and go between worlds, and thus go food shopping – and when said vampire has a backup in the person of an eastern European werewolf called Miss Lupescu, a formidable ally despite her penchant for borscht, then the pro-Bod and anti-Bod forces are more evenly balanced.Will the Jacks find and slaughter Bod before he has grown up enough to be able to foil them? Will the forces of Good-Goth prevail over the forces of Bad-Goth? Will you have as much fun reading this book as Gaiman obviously had while writing it? Of course you will! Will you shed a surreptitious tear during the danse macabre, when the living dance with the dead under the patronage of Death herself, but poor Silas the vampire is excluded, being neither one nor the other? Yes, you will.The Graveyard Book has that many-layered quality so prized in the best children’s books: gripping for eight-year-olds, but with deeper shades and resonances for older people. It’s a true pleasure, from beginning to beginning – for our hero must eventually conclude his education, and graduate from death to life.• Neil Gaiman’s The Graveyard Book is published by Bloomsbury.

The OBR, which is the Treasury’s independent forecaster, could give back up to £15bn of revenues that it said would be lost following a basic agreement to leave the EU.In a clear message to Tory backbenchers who oppose Theresa May’s proposals to stay inside a customs union with the EU indefinitely, Hammond said extra spending on services such as the NHS, debt reduction and tax cuts would be possible if they backed the prime minister when the deal was voted on in the Commons.Speaking in Bali, where he is attending the International Monetary Fund’s annual meeting, he said: “I believe there will be a idend, a deal idend for us. If we are successful in negotiating that package, there will be an upside idend in terms of the economy and consequently the fiscal numbers.“The second bonus is that I have been holding a slightly larger fiscal buffer than would be necessary because of the degree of uncertainty that exists at the moment. As that uncertainty is unwound and we are in more favourable circumstances, logically one would need less of a fiscal buffer and some of that could be released to support the spending envelope or deliver tax cuts.”It is possible Hammond will consider cutting pension benefits after he described pensions tax relief as an “eye-watering” sum, but he is expected to make only limited changes.Hammond said he was unmoved by pleas to use some of his Brexit bonus to increase welfare spending and in particular to boost the money available for universal credit. The former prime minister Gordon Brown said this week the new benefit system would spark a summer of discontent and poll tax-style chaos if it was rolled out nationally next year.Hammond said he had already given £6bn to ease the rollout of the scheme, which is a replacement for benefits including tax credits and housing benefit. He would be prepared to find further sums for “bumps in the road”, but said he was committed to its implementation.“I believe universal credit is the right way to go. It is a huge improvement to our welfare system. It is a structural change that gives us a system that focuses on those who need it most,” he said.The chancellor is already committed to spending an extra £35bn more than he has budgeted for by 2022 after the prime minister’s pledge to boost NHS spending by £20bn a year and lift the revenue cap on local authorities to boost council house building.Hammond said he was optimistic that a Brexit deal would be struck with the EU but some major differences remained.“What has happened over the last 10 days is that there’s been a measurable change in pace. There’s a real sense now of engagement from both sides of shared enterprise in trying to solve a problem rather than posturing towards each other."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99b193c3114ae22b36dafc83522cb615a644748f/278_491_4591_2755/master/4591.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba56fff1e5a3df58b9a777fd0966cbac","title":"oxfam criticises world bank for backing deregulated labour markets","story":"World Development Report dismisses concern about growing income inequality, say criticsAid charities and trade unions have denounced a World Bank report that advises some of the poorest countries in the world to accept the demands of multinational corporations to hire and fire workers and remove laws protecting workers’ rights.Oxfam said the report’s main message was that governments should abandon labour market regulation and rely instead on low levels of welfare to prevent workers falling into extreme poverty.With poor countries facing the twin threats from large corporates unwilling to negotiate with trade unions and young start-ups insisting on casual labour arrangements, Oxfam said the World Bank appeared to offer labour market deregulation as the only way to prepare countries for the changing nature of work.The International Trade Union Confederation also expressed alarm, saying that the World Bank, which provides development loans to struggling nations, was guilty of accepting as benign the sweeping changes brought in by new technologies, in its latest World Development Report (WDR).It also accused the World Bank of selectively choosing a small group of countries and household income figures from favourable years to illustrate falling levels of inequality.“One particularly striking assertion near the beginning of the report is the dismissal of any concern about growing income inequality. It does this by claiming that in 37 of 41 developing and emerging economies Gini coefficients, which measure inequality, either decreased or remained ‘unchanged’ between 2007 and 2015. Besides the limited number of countries in the sample, the choice of the WDR to retain only eight years of data – starting with the beginning of the global financial crisis – is highly selective,” it said.Launched at its annual meeting in Bali, the World Bank’s annual policy statement is widely regarded as setting the tone for anti-poverty projects across the developing world. A draft of the report published earlier this year was widely criticised for proposing lower minimum wages alongside greater hiring and firing powers for employers.Proposals to cut minimum wage levels have been dropped, but broader deregulation policies remain a key theme of the report, critics said.The bank’s president, Jim Yong Kim, said he was urging governments to increase spending on social protection, health and to clamp down on tax evasion.“The report challenges governments to take better care of their citizens, calling for a universal guaranteed minimum level of social protection. Full social inclusion will be costly, but it can be achieved with reforms in labour market regulation in some countries and, globally, a long overdue overhaul of taxation policy,” he said.Oxfam said the emphasis on social protection put the costs of supporting workers and poor households on the government, letting employers off the hook.“The WDR casts serious doubts over the commitment of the World Bank to reducing the gap between rich and poor,” it said.“Its core recommendation, the need to water down the rights of workers for the greater good of the economy, was discredited may years ago. It is completely at odds with the OECD and the International Monetary Fund, both of which are saying that we need more trade unions and higher minimum wages to counteract the growing power of extreme wealth in the world.”The World Bank has suffered a turbulent year following the exit of its chief economist, Paul Romer, who quit after accusing his department of manipulating figures to support the bank’s policies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aeb86c0b6bfc070ea0f44257d6ab85476b1e0fe6/0_0_3804_2717/master/3804.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9e36534eeb0dd7e17a19ce277c04b6b","title":"great gatsby royal wedding princess eugenie f scott fitzgerald","story":"Princess Eugenie must know F Scott Fitzgerald’s tragic hero is broken like a butterfly on the wheel of old money and inherited privilege“Um. This quite strongly suggests that they don’t know what The Great Gatsby is about,” was the reaction of one Twitter user to the discovery that today’s royal wedding was to include a quote from F Scott Fitzgerald’s masterpiece in the order of service. You’d have to think he has a point. The Great Gatsby is a book riddled with adultery and sexual double standards. True love (spoiler alert) fails to win out in the cruellest possible way. The hero dies in the end and nobody shows up to his funeral. And the book has some very pointed things indeed to say about empty materialism, social privilege and the seamy criminal underpinnings of the glitz and glamour of high society.I mean, for a wedding ceremony where the father of the bride is reported to have been furious that the BBC declined to broadcast it live and in full on national television, where the streets of Windsor are to be closed to traffic so that Princess Eugenie (ninth in line to the throne) and her groom Jack Brooksbank (brand manager for a tequila firm) could parade through the streets in a carriage waving to the common people ... it could all look a little bit on the nose, couldn’t it? Among other things, the tragic hero of Fitzgerald’s story is himself ghastly new money striving for reinvention, and the book’s tragedy is the way he is broken like a butterfly on the wheel of old money, social convention and inherited privilege. It’s not a book that roots for any American equivalent of the royal family.That said, it contains some nice frocks, and makes mint juleps sound bloody delicious, so it’s not all bad. And the passage they did choose, describing Gatsby’s magnetic smile, reads well in isolation: “It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself.” But the rest of the novel, of course, goes on to make clear how, to quote another great work, you could take a good look at that face and see that the smile is out of place. Gatsby is a contrivance, a performance, a seductive chimera, a fraud.Still, they could have done worse. Remember the eyes of T J Eckleburg – the vast commercialised peepers of a deus mostly absconditus – lowering sightlessly over the Valley of Ashes? There’s a metaphor for the paparazzi if ever I’ve seen one. Above all – and this is one that will be in the minds of everyone whose car is snarled in a traffic jam, or who has to take the long route round to their kids’ football match, because the couple insisted on a regal procession by carriage through the streets of Windsor at lord knows what cost to the public purse – there’s the killer line: “They were careless people, Tom and Daisy – they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together and let other people clean up the mess they had made.”Fortunately, at the time of writing the royal carriage hasn’t (spoiler alert again) run over anyone’s mistress or similar.But it’s worth remembering that Gatsby contains multitudes. It is a drastic underreading to see it as a simple polemic against wealth and unthinking privilege (though it contains that), or the chimerical cruelty of the American Dream (though it contains that too). It is a love story, and an achingly romantic one. It’s a book about time and loss and hopelessness and the impossible longing to reinvent yourself and capture a moment in and out of time. But, friends, it does end badly.Safest, then, might have been to stick to the epigraph – a couple of lines from a poem by the (fictitious) poet Thomas Parke D’Invilliers: “Then wear the gold hat, if that will move her  If you can bounce high, bounce for her too,  Till she cry ‘Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover,  I must have you!’”Better yet, if Jack Brooksbank were to have closed the ceremony by wearing a gold hat and jumping up and down on a trampoline until Eugenie cried “Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover, I must have you!” ... that would have been romantic, wouldn’t it? In fact, I’d have turned out on the streets of Windsor to see it.• Sam Leith is literary editor of the Spectator"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cbb044e1b2c05dc50e1337570bae502edc005a6/0_163_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20bd5ae78d069f054db767d4150366c1","title":"peoples vote campaign ditch celebs brexit","story":"Ditch the celebs and faded politicians. Instead visit areas that voted for Brexit – and listen to what’s being saidThe music, apparently swelling towards a climax that never arrives, sounds like a Coldplay outtake, and most of the faces suggest an entertaining Saturday night in front of the TV. On and on they go: the singer Jamelia, the actor Dominic West, Philip Pullman, Stephen Mangan, Josh Widdicombe, Tracey Ullman, Natascha McElhone, the musician Nitin Sawhney, Gary Lineker, Matt Lucas and good old Dan Snow. Non-famous people seem to be few and far between, with the exception of an unnamed man in front of a football crowd and someone whose caption merely says “a farmer from Scotland”.This is the latest, somewhat rough-edged, promotional video chucked online by the people behind the people’s vote demonstration that will happen in London on 20 October. Millions – including me – will instantly agree with what its cast have to say, from comedian Tim Minchin’s insistence that “neither government nor the people had very much information about the implications of Brexit”, to Snow’s observation that “we are barrelling towards either a bad deal or no deal”.But, God, there is a problem here. Ostensibly, the video is aimed simply at encouraging people to go on the demo, a job it may well be doing reasonably well. But it clearly has a larger reach, and shines light on an increasingly inescapable problem: the failure of the range of forces now pushing against Brexit (from Open Britain, to Scientists for EU and the student campaign FFS (AKA For our Future’s Sake), and Britain for Europe) to do much more than working up their own side, and get anywhere near shifting the balance of opinion in the country.That is not to say that some leave voters have not changed their mind: I have met a few, and their number may well be slowly growing. Clearly, Brexit remains a terrible idea. But split your time between remain and leave-voting communities, and what opinion polls seem to be picking up rings true: the public continues to be as split on the issue as it was two years ago, and the huge constituency of leave supporters who wonder why we haven’t left already far outweighs the number of repentant Brexiters who would now back staying in the EU. To quote from a recent report in the Times: “There is no evidence of large numbers of leave voters changing their minds about the merits of their initial decision.” Given the mess the prime minister is in, the lunacy of the half-formed visions offered by Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg et al, and headlines about everything from fretful car manufacturers to trial lorry parks on the M26, that is really quite something.Overall, there is still precious little awareness that if you put the people formerly known as the great and the good at the forefront of anti-Brexit campaigning, you run the risk of simply reminding millions of people why they voted to exit the EU in the first place. The problem is arguably symbolised by one fact above all others: that by the end of this month, the two biggest anti-Brexit events to date will have been huge marches in London.On a bad day, it feels like the most active remainers have wasted the past two years just as blithely as the people nominally in charge of Brexit when the clouds break and let a little light in, it feels, although their sheer persistence is worth saluting, it is high time they changed tack. So: ditch the celebs and faded politicians. Be seen pitching up in the places that voted leave, and finally listening. Find everyday voices with a clear sense of the nitty-gritty calamities that await. And perhaps bear in mind the words of the venerable Gina Miller, uttered at the people’s vote march earlier this year. “It’s time we took things back to the streets and the lanes, the towns and the villages, the meadows and the squares of this country,” she said. So why haven’t they done it?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b00a820ba75b4ef2628caf1b128f450e9be9a2e/0_116_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19de5248f11c06c84205513c87ba85ff","title":"the guardian view on universal credit human cost and political price","story":"Warnings on successive days this week by two former prime ministers, Gordon Brown and Sir John Major, that universal credit could prove as unpopular as the poll tax, have pushed the government’s continuing struggle with benefit reform back up the agenda. A crunch moment is expected soon, with new regulations due to be approved by parliament before the next phase of the rollout can go ahead. Conservative backbenchers including Robert Halfon and Heidi Allen have broken ranks and threatened a rebellion if the next phase is not rethought.Labour is conducting a review and will announce in due course whether it is sticking with its current policy of “pause and fix”, or changing course. Recent comments from the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, that universal credit is a “shambles” and should be scrapped suggest that the party may be moving towards proposing abolition.The Tory rebels, like Sir John, believe the existing plan is a liability that threatens to alienate precisely the low-income, hard-working voters that they rely on for their majorities in towns such as Plymouth and Harlow. They are right. This week’s belated admission by the work and pensions secretary, Esther McVey, that some families will be worse off than under the existing system blew a hole in the government’s wall of denial.The insight that low-wage voters will be angry when their incomes reduce is surely uncontroversial. More than 3 million people currently receive tax credits. Exactly whose benefits will reduce, and who will gain from the new system, is complicated and depends on circumstances such as the number of children. But it is a view widely shared among mainstream Conservatives, including Theresa May, that the party needs to improve on its offer to these low-income or “just about managing” families that she talked about when she became prime minister in 2016. So far the government has failed to deliver on this promise. Recent research shows that there are 2.8 million people living in poverty in households where every adult works full-time.Universal credit’s inherent problems have been magnified by austerity. Iain Duncan Smith, the scheme’s architect until his resignation from the cabinet in 2016, is pushing for the restoration in the autumn budget of £2bn that was cut from benefits in 2015 by George Osborne.The next move is the government’s. Clearly an injection of billions of pounds into the Department for Work and Pensions budget would ease the pains of universal credit – and reduce the risks associated with migrating claimants from existing benefits to the new one. If Mrs May wants to see off the threat of a revolt over universal credit, she will have little choice but to demand from the Treasury an additional £2-3bn to meet the shortfall. But the chancellor is already committed to finding sufficient tax rises to fund the £20bn promise to the NHS. The issue is where the extra money would come from.As for universal credit itself, the National Audit Office savaged it this summer for causing hardship while failing to meet its objectives of saving money and boosting employment. But the spending watchdog also warned that there was no easy way back. The point of no return has not yet been reached, but at some point it will be. Once the tax credit claimants have been migrated across – and even if the government accedes to demands that it should handle the transfer itself rather than demanding that each claimant should put in a new application – it is unlikely that any new government would reverse the process. This is precisely why the rollout should be halted now.An untransparent bunker mentality has bedevilled universal credit for years, if not from the start. Even as the impact of the changes has become clear, that thinking seems to have become more entrenched. In the long term the hope must be that policymakers will learn from the mistakes which have been so clearly set out by many reports. This week should have shown the government that there may be a political price to pay for the failings of universal credit as well as a human one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/413ebed58aea1bb8345cacae03e5a8058b6a0e89/0_25_3536_2122/master/3536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09def132cc0e7dcf72d69c7aa6137e46","title":"universal credit iain duncan smith","story":"If you were looking for the most wantonly sarcastic epithet in British politics, you might well alight on “Iain Duncan Smith, the architect of universal credit”. It’s basically impossible to say out loud without putting “architect” in air quotes. I know we shouldn’t underestimate the determination of a quiet man. But when people say, “Iain always brings the house down”, what they mean is that everyone gets buried in the rubble.Would you stay in a hotel that advertised Iain Duncan Smith as its architect? You certainly wouldn’t bother asking when breakfast was served. If things went well, you’d be standing outside in a foil blanket at 3am, rebuffing requests to do 10 minutes at the top of Good Morning Britain. If things went as expected, you wouldn’t.Duncan Smith was always that most dangerous type of politician: the sort who thinks that very complicated things are actually very simple. Though universal credit’s “architect” took himself off the project a while back, he still turns up at the site in his pants every now and then, screaming something about the need to add a fire escape. While embarrassing for everyone, this is probably something we ought to listen to.This week, Iain was demanding the Treasury urgently inject an extra £2bn into the new benefits system, to replace the £2bn slashed from the scheme three years ago. Will it? It is unclear at this stage. The government insists it is pressing on with the rollout of universal credit, no matter how many times their own MPs, other MPs, their own former prime ministers, other former prime ministers and countless actual voters whose lives it affects, explain to them what a shitstorm it’s going to be, or indeed already is. This week, the work and pensions secretary, Esther McVey, reportedly told cabinet colleagues that some families – or “customers”, to use the preferred term – will be £200 a month worse off.Is this … normal? We know the Conservatives are the self-styled party of free speech. Even so, it does seem the height of snowflakery for the secretary of state to demand those working for her sign the political equivalent of a non-disclosure agreement. You’d expect a Hollywood megastar’s people to try it on, to protect their client from inquiries about the fact he shags animals on crystal meth, or whatever. But it does seem like something we ought generally to avoid in the politics of the welfare state.In many ways, though, no one is as adept at dragging McVey into disrepute as McVey herself. In July, she was formally reprimanded by the head of the National Audit Office for misleading parliament about its criticisms of the universal credit rollout, and issued a non-apology for “inadvertently” doing so. This week – presumably advertently – she broke the government line and claimed: “I have said we made tough decisions and some people will be worse off.” Or as Esther put it less than a fortnight ago in her party conference speech: “Those who say we are cutting budgets are peddling fake news.” What to believe, other than the worst?As a side note, I do advise you to keep a paper record of everyone who specifically dismisses criticism with Donald Trump’s most famous phrase – from all of Trump’s winged monkeys to Tory cabinet ministers to Jeremy Corbyn. That way you’ll have something to burn for warmth once they get what they think they want. To those politicians and cheerleaders who dismiss criticism peremptorily as “fake news”, I would say only: if you wouldn’t use Trump’s second most famous phrase – “grab them by the pussy” – maybe think twice about legitimising the rest of his dangerous bullshit. Or is it simply too tempting? His playbook, I mean, not the pussy-grabbing. Either way, we can ide the world into two tribes: people who cry “fake news”, and people who aren’t metaphorical pussy-grabbers. Esther McVey is in the former category, clearly – and since her boyfriend is quarterwitted men’s rights MP Philip Davies, this is hardly a surprise.Meanwhile, I am very much enjoying all the Next-Gen Tories putting their markers down this week, reminding Britain that there is a young and vibrant squad out there just itching to take us all the way once the new manager finally calls time on the golden generation. Take the Plymouth MP Johnny Mercer, who also urged the cuts to the system to be reversed but this week tweeted: “Biggest challenge with UC is the bad press it gets (some self-inflicted obvs).”No matter how hard you love that “obvs”, given the grim stories of impoverished crisis that it blithely obvses over, it feels difficult to claim that the main problem with universal credit is the media. I hate to break it to Johnny, but they’re not all reading the , dear, which has been boringly obsessed with it for years. “The media” has been mostly giving a shit about a Strictly snog this week, so the universal credit story mostly still has “cut-through” with claimants whose lives it has cut through. That will change with the full rollout, at which point every single cabinet minister will need to snog a Strictly star to have a hope of distracting from it.Still, the D-notice will probably hold to the bitter end in some quarters. Let’s conclude with a shoutout to George Osborne, the very man who slashed the £2bn that Duncan Smith wants put back into universal credit. Osborne, the former chancellor, is now a Potemkin newspaper editor, and rather more interested in publishing pointless power lists than articles questioning why, for instance, a London single mother, in work, has to resort to using food banks under the new system. The London Evening Standard hasn’t really bothered covering universal credit, preferring to spend most of this week telling you who the capital’s 1,000 most influential people apparently are. I can’t believe the editor didn’t make the list. I know he’s not a leading mixologist or anything, but considering how many lives his policies have influenced, do let’s hope he scores a mention in next year’s dispatches, when his legacy will be all the clearer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37d3c9da42d4f83cb3b00d01ac27826b822e3ef9/109_161_2602_1561/master/2602.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa49e7a58775ee30b4926b99e3751eee","title":"would you have a facebook portal camera in your house me neither","story":"The company says its new smart screen for making video calls is built with privacy in mind.

It is understood, Uefa passed on suspicions to the French authorities after the 3 October game at the Parc des Princes in Group C, which also includes Liverpool and Napoli.France’s financial prosecutor’s office confirmed an investigation had been opened but declined to comment on the report.Red Star, who drew their opening group game 0-0 at home to Napoli, said: “It is with the greatest anger and resentment that Red Star deny today’s report in the French newspaper L’Équipe in connection to doubts about the outcome of the Paris Saint-Germain-Red Star match and the involvement of anyone from Red Star in possible improper actions.“The allegations from this report can cause great damage to the reputation of our club, and therefore Red Star insists both Uefa and the competent investigating authorities in Serbia and France investigate these doubts to the end and come to the truth.“Today’s technologies and various other mechanisms have progressed so much that it is simply not possible for this case to be left unresolved. Red Star expects that the truth about this must come in as short a time as possible and that any doubt about the involvement of any member of our club in any possible disruptive actions must be removed.”PSG expressed “amazement and indignation” and added: “Paris Saint-Germain reiterates its commitment to a fundamental principle of sport, that of the integrity of competitions and therefore refutes any form of practice that could call into question that integrity.”Their statement read: “It was with the greatest stupefaction that Paris Saint-Germain discovered this article on the L’Équipe website regarding suspicions of match-fixing concerning the Champions League game with Red Star Belgrade. The club categorically rejects any and all direct and indirect implication in relation to these suspicions and would like to point out at no moment has Paris Saint-Germain been approached by the National Financial Court in charge of the investigation. PSG remains at the disposal of the investigators and will not tolerate the slightest attack on its reputation nor that of its officials. To that end the club reserves the right to take legal action against any party that makes defamatory statements against the club andor its officials.”ARJEL, the body in charge of regulating online gambling in France, told L’Équipe it did not notice any suspicious bets on the game.A Uefa spokesperson said: “Uefa never comments on potential, or the existence of, investigations into alleged match-fixing so as to not compromise the process of such investigations.“Uefa only communicates on specific casesmatches once disciplinary proceedings have been opened andor decisions have been taken.

England’s goalkeeper peered into the darkness and dutifully lifted his glove without fully giving the impression he knew where these hardy souls were congregated.This certainly was not an orthodox night for anybody associated with the England team. How could it be when it was the first time in 146 years of international football that England have ever been required to participate in a “ghost game”? It was strange, to say the least, and hardly a surprise it took so long before threatening to turn into the kind of match that might ordinarily have been expected. Even then, the excitement had largely petered out by the time Jadon Sancho came on for the final exchanges, looking eager to make a positive impression.Marcus Rashford could not convert England’s most inviting chances and Gareth Southgate’s team had two efforts that came back off the woodwork. The lingering memory, however, will be the peculiar sight of two World Cup semi-finalists renewing acquaintances in a deserted, Lego-like stadium with hardly anybody there to see it.If nothing else, it was nice to hear the national anthem being played before an England away game without a single shout of “No Surrender”. The public announcer, rather quaintly, wished everyone a safe journey home at the final whistle and, for reasons not entirely clear, the Croatian football federation still produced a programme – even though, with no one to buy them, they mostly remained unwanted in a pile of boxes.Security guards in fluorescent orange jackets could be seen monitoring the fences around the stadium and the caged enclosure where England’s followers would usually have been accommodated – known, unofficially, as the “Guantanamo stand” (Hajduk Split’s away fans even turned up for one game in orange boiler suits) – remained padlocked.The chants drifting down from the hillside came from a position among the trees from where half the pitch could be seen. That apart, however, the only other vantage point came from the balconies of high-rise flats next door.It was certainly an eccentric night for Ben Chilwell – presented with his England shirt by Emile Heskey in the dressing room – to make his first start. After a year of operating with a wing-back system, Southgate had reverted to a back four. Jordan Henderson and Ross Barkley were either side of Eric Dier in midfield and a 4-3-3 system had Harry Kane flanked by Raheem Sterling and Rashford in attack.Southgate’s explanation was that he did not want to be tied down to one formation but there was still an emphasis on the full-backs to venture forward and Barkley did at least play more ambitiously after a first half in which his habit of taking the safe option, rather than passing the ball forward, indicated some anxiety on his recall to the team.Kyle Walker, preferred to Kieran Trippier, was one of England’s better performers and Chilwell also stood out in a first half notable otherwise for Henderson’s emergence as the loudest player in the England team.At one point Henderson took offence at something Zlatko Dalic had said and demanded to know – expletives removed – if Croatia’s manager saw himself as the referee. He could have been excused for his grumpiness: a booking for an early foul on Ivan Rakitic means he will be suspended from Monday’s game in Spain. John Stones will also be absent after a yellow card early in the second half.Southgate might have altered England’s system but one aspect of play that had not changed was the danger they posed from set plays. Dier’s header struck the post from one corner and in the second half another of Henderson’s right-sided deliveries, this time from a free-kick, culminated in Kane heading against the bar.These were encouraging moments for England but they were let down by Rashford’s erratic finishing when the Manchester United attacker had two splendid opportunities in quick succession.Dominik Livakovic, Croatia’s goalkeeper, should take the credit but on both occasions Rashford was unconvincing. The first chance, in particular, should have been put away but it was a strange lack of confidence from the striker once Walker’s pass had reached him.Kane would later see a goal disallowed for offside but England’s captain laboured at times and has gone half a dozen internationals without scoring. Sancho, a 78th-minute substitute, briefly threatened to liven up the night but Dalic summed it up afterwards. “It was difficult for everyone,” he said, “and sad for football.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f26135468f2924c100c4dac8530c79c59f6cd357/0_406_3124_1875/master/3124.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33c8884d4b374919027b0cf92c70e683","title":"mohamed salah limps off after scoring goal direct from corner for egypt","story":"• Liverpool forward suffers muscle strain but ‘not a big injury’• Northern Ireland beaten by Austria in Nations LeagueMohamed Salah limped off towards the end of Egypt’s 4-1 win over Swaziland with a “muscle strain”. The Liverpool forward scored direct from a corner in the Africa Nations Cup qualifier in Cairo before appearing to suffer a hamstring injury. The Egypt assistant coach, Hany Ramzy, eased fears over the 26-year-old’s fitness by insisting it was “not a big injury”.“The initial diagnosis confirmed that the injury is a muscle strain and there is no possibility of muscle rupture,” Ramzy said. “It is not a big injury. We support him with all our energy and we hope he will return as soon as possible.”Austria beat Northern Ireland 1-0 in the sides’ Nations League Group B3 meeting in Vienna. A dull first half was followed by a livelier second, with West Ham’s Marko Arnautovic breaking through to score the winner on 71 minutes having been played onside by Jamal Lewis.The defeat leaves Michael O’Neill’s side bottom of their group and in a relegation fight in the competition but O’Neill denied that should be a worry. “There’s three teams in the group and we’re bottom, so yeah,” he said.“But what’s the significance of relegation in this competition? It means we will be playing in League C when it comes around again in two years. That’s not really our concern to be honest. We look at this competition and we want to do as well as we can but we want to develop the team as well.“We had two under-21s in the team and another one on the bench, and we gave a player a debut. We can only develop the team by putting players on the pitch.“Much has been written about the level of resource we have. If we are relegated from Group B it’s not a national disaster for us. There are good teams in League C and we’ll go and play against other countries in two years’ time.

All that’s left is to point you in the direction of our man Daniel Taylor’s match report. Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you again on Monday as England take on Spain in Seville. Nighty night, wherever you are. Sweet dreams!And finally, Gareth Southgate! “When I’m on the bench, I’m engrossed in the game, so it doesn’t make a lot of difference to me. I thought the application of the players was really good. You want to perform in front of a crowd, but they did really well. Second half we were by far the better team, and if we were more ruthless with our chances we should have won the game. We’re going to play Spain in Seville in front of 60,000 people. We want to be competitive, and will pick a team that represents our country the best.”The captain Harry Kane ... “It was hard without the atmosphere. But we played well, especially in the second half. A bit more clinical and we would have won. At the start of the game it was weird, but it was an experience, and I thought we dealt with it well. We heard the fans, and we appreciated the support. The change of formation worked well. Second half especially, we created some good chances.”And now Ross Barkley. “I’ve been here before, so I know what it’s like to play for England. It would have been much better to come away with three points, but we’ve got to stay positive. We had our fair share of chances, on any other day we would have won 3-0. I thought we dominated most of the game, we had the best chances, I can’t remember them having any. Where I’m at right now, I feel fresh and strong. I’ll work hard at club level and that’ll take care of itself.”Ben Chilwell speaks. “It’s a massive day for myself and my family. For me it was about having a good game and a good performance. Of course I’d like my family to be here, but I’m sure they’re watching on TV. We just had to get on with it. It’s strange in an empty stadium. We were all aware it was going to be weird. In the changing room there were a lot of big characters I wanted to play with, so today was a very special moment. I’m ready to go again on Monday!”As things stand in League A, Group 4:Eric Dier speaks. “It was strange. It was the first experience of it for all of us, a strange atmosphere. But once the game started we put it in the back of our minds. And we heard the supporters up on the hill, because they were the only ones! The new formation suits me well, and the team did well with it today. It’s important for us to have that flexibility. I thought I’d scored! It skidded off the grass onto the post, it was quite unlucky. Sancho was fantastic when he came on. He’s fast and technically very gifted, and hopefully he’ll be a big part of England in the future.”It wasn’t much of a match the surreal, eerie atmosphere can’t have helped. But England will be happy with their performance against the World Cup finalists. They were the better side tonight. Croatia created next to nothing, while England hit the woodwork twice, and Marcus Rashford missed two glorious chances in two uncertain minutes. Not ideal, then, but not so bad either. Given this game was perhaps always destined to be a weird non-event, Gareth Southgate has plenty of positives to take away, ahead of the big test in Seville on Monday night.Well, that was an event.90 min +3: It’d have been nice to experience a goal met by total silence. But it looks like that box will remain unticked on the old bucket list. “If an England player scores I really hope they celebrate with a cupped hand around the ear,” wishes Damian Brown.90 min +1: There will be four added minutes. “Here’s your fairytale,” begins Ian Copestake, clearing his throat. “Once upon a time, a young man named Foden broke into the first team of the Premier League champions but could only stare aghast as some other young man playing in a less good league was elevated to the senior England squad ahead of him.” It probably needs another pass.90 min: Sancho embarks on another skedaddle down the right. He’s got Pivaric on toast! He reaches the byline and floats a gorgeous looping cross towards Kane in the middle. It’s beaten Livakovic ... but it also beats Kane and then Barkley. Just a little bit too high. But what an impression Sancho has made already. We nearly had our fairytale!88 min: Sancho gives Pivaric a 15-yard head start in a footrace down the right. He wins. But his resulting cross isn’t so impressive. “Why not play this game at Wembley?” wonders Barry Webb. “Surely this would have been an equally appropriate punishment for Croatia and not have deprived England fans of watching the match. Plus all us poor devils watching a game like it’s being played in a London tube station.” Eduardo Paolozzi would approve of this stadium mosaic, it’s true.86 min: Jedvaj slips between Rashford and Chilwell and into the England area on the right. His cutback reaches Kramaric, but the resulting shot, from the penalty spot, isn’t so hot. It’s easily hacked clear by Stones.85 min: Chilwell probes down the left and nearly breaks clear, but clatters into Kramaric and the danger is over.83 min: Kramaric spins past a couple of challenges and makes good down the middle. He flicks the ball to his right for Pjaca, who in turn nearly feeds Livaja. But Chilwell reads the danger well, and steps in to intercept.82 min: Henderson, out on the left, chips into the Croatia box and very nearly finds the head of Sancho, who has come in from the other flank looking to write that aforementioned fairytale. Shame, but the cross is just a bit too high.80 min: Croatia make their final change. Livaja replaces the hard-working striker Rebic.79 min: Some more loose play by Maguire, who has been in a bit of a flap for most of the night. He gifts possession to Modric, who is extremely annoyed with himself by messing up a chance to release Kramaric down the middle. His immediate ball forward hits the back of his team-mate’s head. Slapstick nonsense all round.78 min: Sterling makes way for the 18-year-old Borussia Dortmund sensation Jadon Sancho. Now then. Fairytale, please!76 min: Kane’s jiggered the net with that shot. Some running repairs are being made. Knit one, purl one.74 min: Badelj comes on for Kovacic. Modric has a pot-shot from distance, but Pickford is always claiming the bouncing ball. England go straight up the other end, Henderson finding Kane clear in the area with a pass slipped down the inside-right channel. Kane lashes a low shot into the bottom corner, but he’d gone too soon and is correctly flagged offside.72 min: Sterling tries to barge his way past Kovacic, but drags his man to the ground. The whistle goes for a free kick. Sterling, boiling with frustration, hoofs the ball goalwards anyway. “How was that a foul?” he asks the ref, who responds by flashing the yellow card in his affronted face. To be fair to Sterling, there wasn’t a whole lot in the challenge, and he would have been clear had play been waved on, so you can understand his pique. 70 min: Rebic, on the left-hand edge of the England D, takes a touch inside to evade Henderson and curls hard towards the top right. It’s a fine effort, and Pickford thinks it might be going in. A panicked e, but the ball sails past the right-hand post. That would have been a very pretty goal.69 min: Pjaca comes on for Perisic.67 min: Kovacic rolls a pass across the face of the England box from the left. Kramaric slices a first-time shot miles wide of the right-hand post. “It would be nice if the England team acknowledged their fans after the game by doing a lap of honour around the outside of the stadium,” suggests Ian Copestake. Yes, and seeing we’re compiling a wishlist, it’d also be good if, at some point, the fans on the hill broke into a knowing rendition of “This is a library” or a waggish chorus of “Your support is fucking shit”.65 min: Modric bursts down the right but turns tail quickly enough. The hosts haven’t seriously tested England at all tonight.63 min: Now it’s England’s turn to hog the ball awhile, to little effect. 61 min: Croatia pass and probe, probe and pass. England hold their shape.59 min: Jedvaj slides in on Dier. He’s late, and crumps his studs onto Dier’s instep. It could be a red, but the referee is lenient. Just a yellow. To be fair, it looked clumsy and accidental, and the player wasn’t out of control, though you have seen folk dismissed for that regardless. Dier didn’t make too much of it, either, which probably helped.57 min: Rashford misses another one-on-one! Sterling slips him through the middle, and Rashford looks for the bottom right again. But he telegraphs his intentions by opening up his body, and his sidefooted effort is parried away from Livakovic. A good save, though it wasn’t a particularly good effort.55 min: Walker bursts down the right, barges through a couple of challenges, then curls a fine pass into the centre to release Rashford, who is one on one with Livakovic! The striker tries to guide the ball first time, back across the keeper and into the bottom right. But he doesn’t get any purchase on his effort whatsoever, a miserable waft falling softly into the keeper’s arms. What a chance!54 min: Corner for Croatia. Rebic, tight on the byline on the left, crosses to nobody in particular. A big Mario Mandzukic shaped hole.52 min: The corner leads to another corner. Then Barkley dribbles into the area from the left. Rebic is behind him, and Barkley goes over. The few fans on the hill scream for a penalty, but Barkley doesn’t really complain, his appeal half-arsed. There didn’t seem to be much contact. Then Stones is booked for a late clip on Kramaric as Croatia try to break. He’ll miss the Spain game too.51 min: England hit the woodwork again! A free kick for England out on the right. Henderson swings it in. Kane rises and heads for the top right. If it’s on target, it’s in, but it hits the bar and bounces back into the mixer. Dier guides the ball goalwards again, but Perisic heads off the line. Corner.49 min: Kramaric considers a shot from 20 yards, having been teed up nicely, the result of some fine work down the right by Modric and Rebic. But the ref gets in the way, so he checks and slides a ball to the left for Perisic, who unleashes a low diagonal screamer towards the bottom right. Pickford does very well to get down and parry to safety.48 min: Pickford finds Barkley with a fine pass under pressure from Rebic. Barkley powers his way past three opponents and slides a pass wide for Walker, whose cutback is intercepted by Pivaric. But England are soon coming again, and Rashford has a look from distance. Nope.46 min: Dier wedges a pass down the right wing. It’s overhit, but Walker gets to it anyway. However he can’t keep his cross in play. Goal kick.And we’re off again! England get the second half underway. The small gathering of English fans up on the hill do their best to make themselves heard. No changes.Half-time reading: And in other noise-related news ...A couple of added seconds, the referee thinks “bugger this”, and blows up for half-time. Everyone mooches off, it’s been that sort of game. In the distance, the fans on the hill can be heard cheering and singing. It’s all decidedly psychedelic.45 min: Lovren is booked for a galoot’s challenge on Sterling, who was hoping to make good down the left wing.43 min: Rashford, fully recovered it seems, forces Pivaric into the concession of a corner on the right. Henderson takes. Dier ghosts in at the near post, guiding a header from the right-hand edge of the six-yard box across a flat-footed Livakovic and onto the left-hand post! The ball rebounds to safety. So unlucky that was a delicious corner. A fine delivery and an almost perfect header. England once again showing their set-piece smarts.41 min: Rashford is accidentally poked in the eye by Perisic, and rolls around accordingly. He’s quickly up and about again.39 min: “I’m quite enjoying the commentators, who seemingly think they’re commentating on golf or the snooker,” writes Andy Bradshaw. Yes, Sky’s Martin Tyler has indeed slipped into a Jazz Club register. Theydon Bois on guitar, Alan Smith on bass.

Authors Elizabeth Uviebinené and Yomi Adegoke explain how they got their big idea off the ground with working lunchesIt is often said that there is a book in all of us, but not all of us possess the grit, determination and means required to bring that book to fruition. By pooling their skills and working collaboratively, friends and co-authors Elizabeth Uviebinené and Yomi Adegoke were able to turn their book dream into a reality.Billed as a manual for modern life for a generation of British black women, Slay in Your Lane is an ambitious debut, ning topics from education to work, dating to health, and money to representation. But what sets this guide apart from its rivals is the fact that it’s built on collaboration, combining the experiences of not just Adegoke and Uviebinené but the insights of women in their own networks, as well as interviews with dozens of Britain’s most successful black women.Today, the duo are practising what they preach. It’s a sunny midweek afternoon in August, and journalist Adegoke and marketing specialist Uviebinené are doing what they so often do – thrashing out plans for their next business move over a bite to eat and a glass of wine. The venue is stylish wine bar and eatery Sapling on Dalston’s Kingsland Road and they’re joined by one of the many women they collaborated with for the book – Anne-Marie Imafidon. She’s co-founder of Stemettes, a social enterprise that inspires young women to progress in the science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) industries. The hot topic of conversation is the merits of creative collaboration.Uviebinené and Adegoke first met as freshers at Warwick University and bonded after noticing how few other black women there were on campus. Five years later, out of university and straight into the workplace, the issues of representation that first brought them together were more prominent than ever. It was after one particularly frustrating morning that Uviebinené rang Adegoke and suggested she write about their experiences. Adegoke replied with an emphatic “yes” and then an equally emphatic “but let’s do it together”.This signalled the start of a creative collaboration between the best friends, a mode of working that they both believe has been the secret ingredient to the resulting book’s success. For the two first-time authors with no publishing experience or connections to the industry, it was the decision to do it together that gave them the confidence to jump headfirst into the project. “Because there were two of us and we really believed in each other, the book went from being the twinkle of an idea to a physical proposal very easily,” Adegoke explains. “Doing it together meant we could constantly encourage each other.”Living together as they collaborated on the book meant that any time outside of their working schedules could be dedicated to dreaming up ideas for the project. Naturally, shared mealtimes became the optimum place to debrief on anything new. The pair definitely used to bond over food, Adegoke says, describing the “delicious, unusual” dishes Uviebinené would make for her: “Things like jerk salmon, pasta and seafood.” Often, friends would drop by and they’d enjoy a Thai feast and a bottle of wine. “Eating and debriefing is very much a highlight of my week,” Adegoke adds, “no-one’s ever too busy for a good meal, and it’s one of the few times in a week I can properly find out what everyone’s up to.”Beyond their own friendship group, the pair reached out to other women they knew to get involved, for help with everything from focus groups to photo shoots. Ideas were tried and tested over informal social settings, very often over food and wine. “A meeting room would feel too serious,” Uviebinené explains. “You eat, you relax and ultimately you let your guard down,” she says. “Dinner parties are always interesting, because a lot of friends have ‘side-hustles’ that they’re trying to get off the ground alongside their nine-to-five jobs. There are always a lot of ideas being bounced around over food and wine and lots of words of encouragement and advice.”The importance of women encouraging and supporting other women is critical now more than ever and Adegoke is refreshingly straight-talking on the topic. “We live in a world where most things work against women,” she says, “and on another level they work against women of colour, so it’s incredibly important for us to be there for each other.”Imafidon agrees, in her role at Stemettes she’s working to get women interested in fields too often focused towards male students. “There’s this saying: ‘You can’t be what you can’t see,’” she says. “I think it’s really important to set up environments where girls can see all the possibilities, and beyond them.”Between breaking open new industries and breaking bread with your trusted support network, collaborating on ideas and sharing advice is clearly on the menu for an increasingly social group of creative women.Made for sharingFrom delicious food and wine to music, art and words of wisdom, Campo Viejo believes that life’s better shared.

As a family, we’d eat around a little table in a room that I now cannot stand up in, heated by a peat-fired Rayburn and served next door by a composting toilet.My parents were often concerned for my nutrition, and did exceptionally considering their busy working lives. They’d manage to keep the cupboards stocked and cook warming classics from scratch – mince, steak pie, myriad brownish stews. They’d be served with potatoes, often from the garden, and at least one floppy green vegetable.My grandmother lived next door, and as well as secretly plying me with confectionery, from time to time she’d put on a roast. I still have a soft spot for vivid-green broccoli that Gran would boil with bicarbonate of soda until disintegration. Good for soaking up gravy, as well as for dentures.Since leaving the howling winds and isolation of the north for a story of my own, life still revolves around food. It has the amazing capacity to bring people together. Until very recently I was a junior doctor, and I’d unashamedly butter up my hospital colleagues with pastry. The theatre coffee room was always alight with talk of Bake Off and Masterchef, and filled with homemade cakes. It was the pressure from my wife, friends and colleagues who enjoyed my food that forced me into applying to Bake Off. We actually all watched it together, but they felt that it should be me who applied.Since Bake Off, there’s been a significant level of expectation on me when it comes to pudding. I sometimes feel like my wife and I compete in a dinner party league, in which we take turns to host friends in a disingenuous performance of informality.Not that I’d ever reveal the planning that goes into our apparently effortless cooking. But our extensive overthinking hides true incompetence. The construction of a wood-fired pizza oven in the garden over the course of a weekend was one such example. There was the obsession over the type of bricks and granite to use and the clay, which cracked and mildly exploded as soon as I lit the expensive seasoned wood I’d sourced and stacked inside. The result was, at least, only mildly ash-covered pizza.The gathering to eat transcends food, and the drink. I’ll admit that I remember flavours and smells better than I remember sounds or words or even people, but better than all is a feeling of being at ease and in the company of people you like. Following the peak of the pudding, the wine continues to flow. Colleagues and associates leave as new friends and, maybe, with a scrawled recipe or two. Scrunched in a pocket and tossed with receipts, it isn’t the recipe that matters.Makes enough to serve four very hungry Scottish peopleSalted or unsalted butter, for greasingFresh rhubarb, 600g Caster sugar, 150g1 bramley appleDried breadcrumbs, 50gFor the spongeSalted butter, 50gCaster sugar, 50g1 egg, mediumSelf-raising flour, 150g Baking powder, ½ tsp Milk, to loosenTinned custard, to serveI vividly remember standing on a stool to watch as Gran made perfect pastry with her worn hands.Baking was the intergenerational bond that we had between us, and those hours spent in her kitchen dusted in flour are still the memories that define my childhood. This charlotte recipe was one that Gran made to use up any leftovers – and the version I’ve given you here is foolproof baking.Her version wasn’t traditional – we didn’t use sliced bread to line the base and sides. We combined a simple sponge with stewed fruit and it was heaven – especially when warm. This version came about when there was too much pie filling (in retrospect, there’s no such thing as too much pie filling), or we’d overdone it on the sponge mix. It was easy to pick and stew some rhubarb, stick it in a dish and top with the leftover sponge.Gran was a big fan of stewing the rhubarb to oblivion, but this both adds an extra step and loads of washing up. I prefer slicing it thinly, and building it up layer by layer, sprinkling generously with sugar.Start by preheating your oven to 180C160C fangas mark 4. Use an ovenproof dish that isn’t going to leak. Those trendy blue and white ones are perfect. Give your dish a rub with loads of butter, all the way up the sides.Prepare your rhubarb – get rid of any leaves and the white bits towards the base of the stalk. Slice rather thinly – less than a centimetre, anyway. This helps them break down without stewing, and helps in the layering with the sugar. You can also peel and core your bramley apple, before slicing it thinly, too.\u0026nbspCover your greased dish with a layer of apple, first of all, to help absorb some of the moisture lost by the rhubarb. Sprinkle this with a thin coating of sugar, then layer up with rhubarb. Cover with more sugar, and then continue to layer until you’ve no fruit left. Finally, coat with a thin topping of breadcrumbs: this grabs any remaining moisture to stop the sponge going soggy. Set this fruity construction aside.Now, make the sponge. Into a mixing bowl, place your butter. If it isn’t already really soft, stick it in the microwave until it’s just-about-melted-but-not-quite. If you’re snobbish enough not to own a\u0026nbspmicrowave, stick the bowl of butter over a bowl of hot-not-boiling water.Once the butter is very soft, add in your sugar and give them a quick stir together with a wooden spoon. Don’t bother creaming them. Once combined, add in your egg and give the mix a beat until it’s smooth. Add in your flour (no need to sieve) and baking powder, and give the whole thing a gentle mix until there are no lumps visible. You should have a fairly gorgeous, smooth mix that ribbons as your spoon glides through it – if not, splash in a tablespoon or two of milk to loosen.Scoop the mix on top of your prepared rhubarb and carefully smooth it out with the back of your spoon. Once nearly at the edge all the way around, stick the whole thing in the oven and bake for about 30-35 minutes, or until the sponge is a deep golden brown and you can see signs of bubbling rhubarb escaping around the sides. Don’t stick a skewer in, but check the sponge’s doneness by pressing lightly with a finger. It should bounce back at you. If you leave a ot, give it another 5 minutes. It won’t be any worse for it.Best paired with …With its crisp, fresh flavours, white fruit aromas and delicate stream of bubbles, a glass of perfectly chilled Cava Brut Reserva makes an ideal accompaniment to the sharply-sweet flavours of rhubarb charlotte.Made for sharingSharing is in the vines at Campo Viejo.

Transcripts of the meeting were made public on Friday.“A month ago, this committee asked us to look at digital advertising,” he said. “That is something we are actively considering, subject to Brexit in the next few weeks, because it has a big resource implication for us. It is certainly something we are interested getting involved in.”Coscelli said that if the CMA were to launch an investigation, it would be hand in hand with Ofcom.By 2020, Facebook will be bringing in an estimated £3.8bn in UK advertising spending – £1bn more than this year – and only slightly less than the value of the entire commercial TV market (£4.04bn).Last year, the world’s two biggest advertisers, Procter \u0026amp Gamble and Unilever, threatened to withdraw advertising from Facebook and YouTube unless the platforms cleaned up the “swamp”.The companies are also facing wider scrutiny after the Cambridge Analytica data scandal and Facebook’s role in the dissemination of “fake news”.In July, Facebook was fined £500,000 – the maximum possible amount – for a lack of transparency and failing to protect users’ information, relating to the scandal.In May, the government said laws would be introduced to tackle the internet’s “wild west”, saying the legislation will make Britain the safest place in the world to be online.Proposals include a potential levy to make companies such as Google and Facebook pay for measures to combat and raise awareness about online bullying and other dangers.Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has said that if there were no imminent international agreement on a digital services tax on internet companies, the UK government would be willing to introduce one.Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google have all been criticised for using legal ways to pay small amounts of tax on multimillion-pound profits."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56a0638b1ea7e58f24b00b472ca6bd956107b0fd/0_614_5680_3408/master/5680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d46ae0757847314e21c9a3fd99f606e","title":"lets move to abergavenny food glorious food","story":"Some will say it’s turning into a foodie destination, but there’s enough unpretension to burst any inflated egosWhat’s going for it?

A projection of the late singer will “perform” digitally remastered arrangements of her songs, backed by a live band, singers and what the production company Base Hologram calls “theatrical stagecraft”.Winehouse’s father, Mitch, described the endeavour as a dream. “To see her perform again is something special that really can’t be put into words,” he said. “Our daughter’s music touched the lives of millions of people and it means everything that her legacy will continue in this innovative and groundbreaking way.”Mitch Winehouse said the tour will raise money and awareness for the Amy Winehouse Foundation. The charity educates young people about drug and alcohol misuse, provides support for those at risk and supports the development of disadvantaged young people through music.The show is expected to last 75 to 110 minutes.The Winehouse tour is Base Hologram’s third such project. Productions featuring Roy Orbison and the opera singer Maria Callas are currently playing. Since 2012, when a hologram of Tupac appeared at the Coachella festival in California, the technology has become increasingly common.A hologram of Billie Holliday performs daily 40-minute shows at the Hologram USA Theater in Los Angeles. A similar tour featuring the likeness of Whitney Houston was scrapped in 2017 after her estate said the technology was not ready. Other tours are planned featuring the metal musician Ronnie James Dio and Frank Zappa.Abba have said they will use the technology as part of a new “virtual experience” expected to debut next year. Abba’s Benny Andersson said in 2016: “We’re inspired by the limitless possibilities of what the future holds and are loving being a part of creating something new and dramatic here. A time machine that captures the essence of who we were. And are.”Winehouse’s last performance was at the Tuborg festival in Belgrade on 18 June 2011. The chaotic set, in which Winehouse slurred lyrics and forgot the names of her band members, led to the cancellation of a European tour. She was found dead at her home in Camden, north London, on 23 July 2011.A new documentary, Amy Winehouse – Back to Black, will be released in November. It includes “previously unseen footage of Amy” and new interviews with her collaborators Mark Ronson and Salaam Remi."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75f48fccf652e97d216c03e9ce6a5405e595773c/0_111_4253_2551/master/4253.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2414abdacae4f934e69aec8e88bae28e","title":"taylor swift democrats midterm election celebrity political endorsements","story":"More than 160,000 people registered to vote after the singer backed Democrats for the midterm elections– but some in Nashville don’t like celebrities to ‘force views’ on votersMore than 160,000 people registered to vote in the space of 48 hours after Taylor Swift finally weighed in on American politics this week, sparking excitement on the left that the country-cum-pop star could even seal a Senate seat in Tennessee.Swift declared her support for two Democratic candidates in a post on her Instagram account on Sunday. Less than five weeks ahead of the November midterm elections, which are widely seen as a referendum on Donald Trump’s America, Swift’s intervention has prompted a mixture of praise, chin-stroking and outrage.The 28-year-old is far from the first celebrity to express her political views, but her young fans – she has more than 112 million followers on Instagram – are seen as particularly loyal and impressionable.But will the Swift intervention make a difference?“One hundred percent,” said Tee Cahours, who was tending bar at Crazy Town in Nashville’s touristy Broadway strip. “She’s a huge icon not only in pop but country music – she’s the reason that nowadays people are more likely to listen to country.“Purely because of that reason her fans will say: ‘Oh, Taylor Swift likes this person, I’ll trust them.’”Crazy Town is one of about a dozen almost indistinguishable – live band, happy hour discount on Miller Lite, faint but distinct smell of vomit – establishments that line Broadway in downtown Nashville. The crowd is mostly grey-haired, and frequently inebriated, but at 20 years old, Cahours is in the age bracket of people who might be seen as susceptible to Swift’s politics. Cahours said she was not a Swift fan – but she understood her potential influence.“And if he was to post that he was going to vote for a specific presidential candidate, I would be more likely to vote for who he said he was going to vote for. It’s almost the same thing as children voting for the same person as their parents voted for, and I think it’s the same thing in the music industry.”According to Vote.org, a non-partisan group that seeks to boost turnout in elections, there was a spike in voter registration after Swift’s post, which mentioned the website. By midday on Tuesday – less than 48 hours after Swift’s post – more than 169,000 new people had registered to vote, Kamari Guthrie, director of communications for Vote.org, told the Washington Post.By comparison, Vote.org added only 56,669 new voters during the whole of August.The two Democrats Swift endorsed were Phil Bredesen, who was governor of Tennessee for eight years until 2011 and is hoping to make it to the US Senate, and Jim Cooper, who is running for the House in a district which encompasses Nashville – traditionally a more leftwing dot in the midst of a conservative state.Some believe that if Swift can make a difference, it will be at the local level.“She’s from the area,” said Kip Wood, a twentysomething who works as a tour guide in Nashville. “It’s a hometown hero kind of thing. Also, it’s kind of liberal here.”Wood, who is originally from south Georgia, was drinking light beer in the Red Door Saloon, a mile west of Crazy Town and a stone’s throw from Swift’s penthouse apartment in Nashville’s midtown district.“But outside of Nashville I have no clue.”That may be the fly in the ointment for those hoping Swift could help Democrats at a statewide or national level.Celebrity endorsements, in American politics at least, have been happening for decades. The Rat Pack, including Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr and Dean Martin, recorded an alternate version of Sinatra’s hit High Hopes during John F Kennedy’s 1960 presidential campaign, while 40 years earlier Warren G Harding, a Republican, was supported in his successful presidential run by the silent film stars Douglas Fairbanks, Lillian Gish and Pearl White.But for all the attention the backing of famous people tends to attract, the jury is out on the impact of celebrity political endorsements, on a national level at least. The consensus among political experts seems to be that endorsements are unlikely to change voters’ minds unless they are particular fans of that celebrity.The standout example is that of Oprah Winfrey endorsing Barack Obama in his 2008 primary race against Hillary Clinton. University of Maryland economists Craig Garthwaite and Tim Moore researched the impact of Winfrey’s backing and believe she was responsible for an additional 1m votes for Obama.Time will tell whether Swift can wage a similar influence. While Cahours and Wood believe she will summon their peers to the polls, the view from the older crowd, being steadily disgorged outside the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum on Thursday, was rather different.“I am a diehard Republican with conservative views,” said Michelle Marks, a 49-year-old from Pennsylvania. Marks was hovering close to the museum’s Taylor Swift Education Center, a series of classrooms where children can attend classes on songwriting and music.“Most country people are conservative. I think you’re entitled to your opinion but just because you’re a celebrity you don’t need to force your views on me.”Marks, who said she liked Swift’s country music but was “not a fan of her pop music”, was at the museum with her husband, David Marks. A gruff, mustachioed military veteran, David Marks was celebrating his 57th birthday on Thursday. He said he would not be influenced by Swift’s Democratic tendencies.Among the museum’s wares is a gold-plated Cadillac that once belonged to Elvis Presley – it has a refrigerator and record player in the back – and outfits and guitars that once belonged to the likes of Hank Williams and Dolly Parton.Paulette Nordahl, who was in town from northern California for a “girls weekend” with a friend, was looking for the Garth Brooks exhibit, having already peered at items once belonging to her other favorites George Strait, Randy Travis and Helen Jackson.“You can understand the words,” Nordahl, 67, said of her attraction to country.“The music – you can actually hear it, and it has a nice rhythm. As long as it’s not twangy.”Nordahl a retired schoolteacher, said that despite her love of Brooks, Strait et al, she would never vote strictly at their behest.“I’d still be looking into all of it pretty darn good,” Nordahl said.“I think everyone should use their own mind, and their own heart, and do what they think, not what someone else thinks,” she said.In early November, we should get an indication of whether people have followed that advice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/071cf2101b7a6195f4a5bb584cde7e77209b5784/55_743_1887_1131/master/1887.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46109da29f41264a6524ad9cae4a3e61","title":"why has the uk stopped producing pop superstars","story":"Three years ago British artists made up half the global top 10. Now the biggest new stars barely make a mark overseas. What is behind this sea change – and is there a way back?Has the UK music business lost its magic touch for creating pop superstars? The UK music industry will celebrate the inaugural National Album Day on Saturday, but top-selling new albums by British pop artists are few and far between in 2018.It’s not that there is a dearth of new music in the UK: albums by Paul McCartney, Years \u0026amp Years, Florence + the Machine, James Bay and hyped new artists Anne-Marie and Jorja Smith have all made it into the top five. But none of them have sold well enough to make the Official Charts Company’s Top 10 releases of the year so far.Only two UK albums released in 2018 made the list: Staying at Tamara’s by George Ezra and Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino by Arctic Monkeys. Soundtracks, US artists and albums released before 2018 populate the rest of the list.It is a similar story in the US. Ed Sheeran – who last released an album in 2017 – is the most popular UK artist in Billboard’s Artist 100 chart, which ranks artists by sales. He came in at No 13. The next entry from a Brit is breakout R\u0026ampB star Ella Mai at No 21, followed by Dua Lipa at No 56. There are no British albums in the Top 20 of the American album chart.The figures make for a stark contrast with the UK music industry’s global performance of recent years, which peaked in 2015 when Adele, Sheeran, One Direction, Coldplay and Sam Smith appeared in the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry’s annual list of the top 10 global recording artists. In 2017, Sheeran was the only British act on the list, at No 1.Industry experts suggest a variety of reasons for this downturn in fortunes, from the dominance of streaming services to the demise of traditional marketing strategies.Streaming services are song-focused rather than artist-focused, which makes it harder for artists working in album formats to break through, says Hannah Neaves, who leads marketing and artist development at Tap, a management company whose clients include Dua Lipa, Ellie Goulding and Lana Del Rey.“Previously, you could burn through two singles quite quickly and there was also a big physical story to tell,” says Neaves. Breaking artists through Spotify takes longer, she says, “because it’s quite faceless” and is focused on editorial playlists. A song’s placement on a popular playlist, such as Rap Caviar, Today’s Top Hits or Viva Latino, can determine its success.“You have to be prepared to spend three years getting to a position that previously would have taken you nine months,” says Neaves. “All the biggest playlists are American and it’s very difficult to get British acts on them, which can make a massive difference to your campaign.”Artists who arrived prior to streaming’s dominance could capitalise quickly on an initial success: Adele’s debut single arrived three months before the release of her debut album in 2008. The same was true of Sheeran in 2011. Dua Lipa is the closest thing to a new British pop superstar: released in 2017, her self-titled debut album has sold 3m copies globally and arrived 19 months after her debut single.Hip-hop is the most popular genre on both sides of the Atlantic, and the UK’s offering has not historically translated well overseas. Despite the international nature of streaming, Columbia Records UK president Ferdy Unger-Hamilton has noticed an increased demand for domestic music and particularly domestic urban music.“You are now making money out of records only in the UK and streaming numbers are big enough that people can do well,” he says. “Every country has found their own language of the oppressed in domestic rap or urban music: the US has 21 Savage and we have Dave. That genre is very self-contained, so when we are trying to sell someone overseas, it’s very hard to compete with what already grabbing the attention.”Popjustice editor Peter Robinson says the way pop stars are marketed first to a “tastemaker” audience of gatekeepers and listeners who pride themselves on their left-field taste, and then to the wider market, could be another obstacle to success.What Robinson describes as a “long, boring, expensive process” can work – it did for Dua Lipa, Ellie Goulding and Lana Del Rey – “but for every Dua there are countless artists who fall by the wayside before people even get to hear their decent songs,” he says.The music industry is now in its key pre-Christmas fourth quarter, traditionally a time for high-profile releases. A “super-deluxe” edition of Dua Lipa’s debut arrives next week and new albums by leading acts Jess Glynne, Muse, Mumford and Sons, Rita Ora and the 1975 could shift the UK’s waning fortunes.Peter Edge, head of RCA Records, suggests a simpler explanation. “The climate has changed in the last three years, but that’s down to the artists. Every artist has a different story to tell – if the right one came along then global success can happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ceba4ebe64f7634e4b304f2ccc97b66f69eac414/0_76_3234_1940/master/3234.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b4d28451b18f2c00c2dff2c42bdf9f2","title":"royal wedding princess eugenie jack brooksbank windsor","story":"Kate Moss and Robbie Williams among guests in Windsor for second royal wedding of 2018Roads were closed, balloted tickets offered to members of the public and the streets of Windsor scattered with royal devotees, but this was, insisted the father of the bride before the service, “not a public wedding. This is meant to be a family wedding.”And so it turned out when Princess Eugenie, the younger daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York, married Jack Brooksbank, a “tequila ambassador”, at St George’s chapel on Friday, in a service that was both a highly formal royal event and a somewhat idiosyncratic ceremony reflecting the distinct character of the younger generation of royals.As befits a ceremony where guests ranged from the Queen to Ricky Martin, the service was conducted by the Dean of Westminster, with music by Andrea Bocelli, while the bridal party included Prince George, and Robbie Williams’s daughter Teddy.The readings included a lesson from St Paul’s letter to the Colossians and an extract from The Great Gatsby, read by the bride’s older sister, Beatrice, which raised eyebrows for its description of the lead character as “an elegant young roughneck, a year or two over 30, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd”.Eugenie, who is ninth in line to the throne, met Brooksbank in 2010 while he was working behind a bar in Verbier, a ski resort favoured by the royals. Describing their “love at first sight” encounter in an interview on the eve of the wedding, he said: “We just stared at each other.” Eugenie said it was his “huge, windscreen wiper wave” that first convinced her he liked her.The groom described Eugenie, 28, as a “bright, shining light”, while she said: “Jack is the kind of guy who, you know, when you are lost at a party … he will walk in and he makes everyone feel so special. He will scoop you up and talk to you and make you feel a million dollars.”Brooksbank, 32, who went on to manage the London nightclub Mahiki, works as a representative for a tequila brand launched by George Clooney. Eugenie, who is employed as a director at the London art gallery Hauser \u0026amp Wirth, does not receive any money from the sovereign grant, which replaced the civil list, but is supported from her father’s private income.The BBC had demurred when offered the opportunity to broadcast the ceremony live, as it had done with the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in May, so the honour fell to ITV, anchored by the This Morning presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford.Although senior royals may be accustomed to a more stately tone, the broadcaster’s more informal approach – Langford asked if the pair wanted “any advice … from an old married couple” – perfectly suited the event. The guestlist of 850 – 250 more than the Duke and Duchess of Sussex – was due to the couple having “so many friends that they need a church of that size to fit them all in”, the Duke of York said.The dean broached the subject of the pressure of royal weddings and marriages in his address, noting that “of course we know … that marriages, even between the kindest and most careful people, can founder because of pressures unforeseen”.The “miracle”, he said, was that “so many of us keep on hoping”, adding that the newlyweds “have acknowledged their need of your support and your encouragement. They want you to believe in them.”As the ceremony ended, the couple paused on the steps for the now customary kiss, followed by a short carriage drive through the streets of Windsor, necessitating the closure of the centre of the town and a policing bill to taxpayers estimated at £2m. The TV coverage then paused for a break in which there was a cannily placed advert for Bocelli’s new album.Though the weather stayed dry, guests arriving at the chapel faced a cold wind that removed the hat of Williams’s mother-in-law and flashed one guest’s underwear to the TV cameras. Wrapped warmly against the gusts, Enid and Charlotte Kendrick from South Yorkshire said they were “so excited” to have won some of the 1,200 tickets offered to members of the public to watch the bridal party from inside the grounds of Windsor Castle, and to have spotted Jimmy Carr and Richard Bacon among the guests.“We’re here just for the love of royalty,” said Charlotte Kendrick, who works as a nurse in Leeds and remembers the royal family’s special tea party in 1981 – when Eugenie’s uncle Prince Charles married Lady Diana Spencer – with her father taking photographs of the event from the television. “I just love the history. I’m a big Tudor fan,” she said.Abby Osgood and Louise Blundell, from Windsor, had brought their children, who were chomping through commemorative chocolate coins and playing computer games on their phones while wrapping their coats around their ears. Why were they such royal fans? “They keep the town nice,” said Osgood. “Without the castle, the town probably wouldn’t be as nice as it is.”Blundell said: “For me, after Harry and Meghan’s wedding, they are changing with the times and they are trying to keep it real.”They had no doubt the couple would be happy together. Osgood said: “Now they are allowed to marry for happiness rather than a certain type or a certain breed. The royal family have learned their lesson. You need to marry someone who makes you happy in the long run.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98fee07c092c89cc25ec0828da7e214f45145be3/0_119_2529_3325/master/2529.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=fa989be42b5257942f86b0a9138e70ca 1400w","title":"revealed secret plans for brexit extension option to appease dup","story":"Effort to avoid Irish backstop would result in UK being EU ‘rule taker’ beyond 21 monthsSecret plans to allow an extension of the transition period in the Brexit withdrawal agreement could result in the UK living under all EU rules well beyond the 21 months so far negotiated, the  can reveal.The expected offer of an extension is designed to convince Arlene Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist party, that the “backstop” plan to avoid the creation of a hard border on the island of Ireland will never come into force.A longer transition period would mean the whole of the country would be locked into a prolonged period of what EU diplomats have previously described as a state of “vassalage”, with the House of Commons being forced to accept Brussels regulations without having any say on them.The revelation came as EU ambassadors were informed at a meeting on Friday evening that, following further concessions by the UK, good progress was being made on a Brexit deal in the negotiations and results could be made public as early as Monday should extra ground be made on the Irish border issue over the weekend.Sabine Weyand, the EU’s deputy chief negotiator, told the 27 member states that the state of play would be assessed by the negotiating teams on Sunday evening. EU officials remain wary, however, that developments in the UK could still derail the deal.In current plans, the backstop, under which the whole of the UK would stay in a customs union while Northern Ireland alone effectively stayed in the single market, would be enacted in December 2020 if a bespoke technological solution or trade deal could not be reached by then.Foster has insisted she will not accept any Brexit deal under which Northern Ireland is treated differently to the rest of the UK.Senior Brexiters, including the Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom, are understood to be planning to attend cabinet next week before deciding on whether to resign. There was alarm about the language used by Downing Street on Friday that Theresa May “would never agree to a deal that would trap the UK in a backstop permanently”. They were concerned, sources said, about any backstop proposal that risks the UK staying in the customs union without a clear date for exiting it.The plan to include an extension clause in the withdrawal agreement would be a way to assuage concerns. It is being discussed privately by European commission and UK negotiators at the talks in Brussels. The length of any extension is yet to be agreed. It is likely that the UK would need to make additional budget contributions on top of its £39bn orce bill to cover the extra time it would benefit from EU membership. It would not, however, have any representation in the bloc’s decision-making institutions.Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, expressed his confidence on Friday that a deal would be struck for the prime minister to sell back home.“People who put all their chips on the hypothesis of no agreement are wrong we must find an accord and I think we will find it,” he told Le Monde.“We need to make substantial progress, which we’ll review next week,” Juncker added, referring to a leaders’ summit that will start on Wednesday night with a dinner at which Brexit will be the focus of the discussion.A senior EU diplomat said that the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, could arrive at the European commission on Monday, should a deal be agreed during intensive talks over the weekend.“Mr Raab has stated he might come to Brussels on Monday,” the diplomat said. “It all depends on progress still having to be made between now and that moment. The negotiating teams are back in their offices today discussing outcome of talks over the last few days.”May asked in September last year for a transition period, which she optimistically described in her Florence speech at the time as a period of implementation of aspects of the future trade deal, including migration controls.The prime minister had said it would be “limited” to a period of about two years. She had added that she did not believe the British people would “want the UK to stay longer in the existing structures than is necessary”.Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, suggested soon after that he would only be open to an extension if it proved necessary to negotiate a trade deal.The prime minister’s spokeswoman said on Friday: “When we published our plans in June on a UK-wide customs backstop, we were absolutely clear that the arrangement would be temporary, and only in place until our future economic relationship is ready.”Mujtaba Rahman, a former Treasury and European commission official, and now head of Europe for the Eurasia Group risk consultancy, said an extra six months would be needed if only for a trade deal to be negotiated and ratified by all the member states’ parliaments.“The UK has no choice but to ask for a mechanism to extend the transition, not least to further mollify the DUP,” Rahman said. “But doing so is also a recognition of reality: both the UK and the EU’s political leadership will change next year, meaning substantive trade negotiations are unlikely to begin until September 2019 at the earliest.”Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the European Research Group, said extending the transition “would not necessarily make the backstop redundant and would be very expensive” because of the expected additional contributions to the EU budget."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2eca4a7272c1bc6d8958f0ec90165ecbc81b5401/0_28_3962_2378/master/3962.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c24bb35d5260415e6b85dffc43b054f","title":"leinster wasps heineken cup match report","story":"Even by their usual high standards Leinster could not have launched their defence of the Champions Cup in more emphatic style. This runaway eight-try win over a depleted Wasps represented a major statement of intent and the Irish province have now equalled their best-ever run in Europe with 10 successive victories.By any standards this was a horribly one-sided rout, with Wasps receiving a brutal reminder that this competition is a step up on the Premiership. By the final quarter Leinster were delivering a virtual masterclass, with a back-flipped pass through his own legs by Johnny Sexton to create his side’s fifth try merely one highlight among many.By the end there were a pair of tries apiece for the scrum-half Luke McGrath and wing James Lowe, fitting reward for a totally dominant team display. Leinster used to have an average record against Premiership opposition but have now registered seven straight wins over English clubs in Europe. This was also Wasps’ heaviest defeat in their long and eventful tournament history.Even taking into account the absence of several key figures, this was as sobering a Dublin night as Wasps have ever endured. It was in this same city 15 years ago that they enjoyed one of their finest hours, beating Munster in a humdinger of a semi-final, but that era feels an increasingly long time ago.“We fell away badly in the last 20 minutes,” said Dai Young, Wasps’ director of rugby. “If you give them the ball they’re really going to hurt you.”If a fit Joe Launchbury, Dan Robson, Jake Cooper-Woolley and Jimmy Gopperth and an available Nathan Hughes would have helped, few teams in Europe would have found an answer to the questions Leinster are posing. Their strength in depth is beginning to verge on the ridiculous, with even proven Lions such as Sean O’Brien and Jack McGrath making only the bench. Even after Dan Leavy was forced to withdraw shortly before kick-off, they were still able to boast 14 Ireland internationals in their starting XV and almost three years have passed since their last home defeat in Europe.Despite conditions in Dublin being significantly calmer than on the opposite side of the Irish Sea, this was never going to be a serene evening for the visitors. Willie le Roux is used to daunting environments, having lined up against the All Blacks in Pretoria last Saturday, but the South African full-back was given scant opportunity to ease himself back into the club fray. Inside six minutes the home hooker Sean Cronin surged clean through a hole around the side of an attacking ruck on Wasps’ 22 and no one, Le Roux included, was able to catch him. Cronin’s starting point did not appear entirely legal but the officials awarded it regardless.With the territory and possession stats also lopsided from early on, Wasps needed someone in place of Hughes and Launchbury to make some hard carrying yards. For that to happen, though, they had to keep hold of the ball for a decent period, not an easy task against such settled, organised opponents. With the breeze at the visitors’ backs, a solitary penalty for Sopoaga in the opening 40 minutes was a distinctly meagre return.The hosts might also have had more points, failing to capitalise on a couple of long-range breaks from Lowe and Robbie Henshaw. Wasps’ defence was proving spirited and committed the question was how long could they keep it up? Their prospects were further diminished when Sopoaga was sent to the sin-bin for a deliberate knock-down in added time just before the interval, offering Leinster a chance to surge forward again and create enough space for the alert Luke McGrath to wriggle over.Barely a minute into the second half the point was swiftly underlined, Sexton feeding a charging Lowe with a smart inside ball to send the Kiwi weaving through the scrambling cover from almost 50 metres out. Sexton’s third successful conversion further extended the gap and Wasps, for all their rearguard defiance, were never going to close it.With Tadhg Furlong producing a marvellous one-handed offload to send the ebullient Lowe away for the bonus-point score, the only question was whether Leinster would hit 50 points. Jordan Larmour and Henshaw both collected eye-catching scores and, sure enough, Jack McGrath collected his side’s eighth try in the last minute. It is going to go take a monumentally good team to stop the champions enjoying another all-conquering campaign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16d356474890929ae56dabd011108a852e8c646f/0_0_4629_2777/master/4629.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b19165020d72824e9c1536009cc2673","title":"nfl london 2018 franchise move wembley","story":"Wembley will host the first of three London games on Sunday and the NFL believes the prospect of a permanent London franchise is now moving closer to realityThe figures are almost as dizzying as a crunching helmet-to-helmet hit from a 300lb defensive lineman.

And while some will be enjoying the jumbo-finger-waving, XXL-jersey-over-hoodie-wearing, Lite-beer-slurping experience for the first time, a record 47,000 hardcore fans have bought a season ticket to all three London games.No wonder Mark Waller, a senior NFL executive, sniffs something in the air. “When we first came to the UK in 2007 it was a great day but it didn’t feel completely like the real thing,” he says. “Now London games have gone from being a novelty to an authentic part of the NFL calendar.”Next year there will be four NFL games – two at Wembley and two at Spurs’ new ground – and with the Jaguars owner Shahid Khan close to buying Wembley the pieces are fast falling into place for a London franchise, possibly as soon as 2022.“We are definitely nearer than ever,” says Waller, the NFL executive vice-president of events and international. “The keys for the NFL are: first, is there fan demand to sustain it, and for me the answer is a clear yes. And second, do we have the stadium capacity, availability and optionality to accommodate our games? The fact there is Wembley, Tottenham and Twickenham ticks that box. Having support from sponsors and the government is vital too.”The NFL backs up its case with research showing nearly four million people in Britain self-identify as “avid” fans – double that of six years ago – and says that Sky and BBC’s viewing figures are also healthier than ever. However, as Waller points out, it needs one of the league’s 32 owners to make a London franchise a reality. “It is not a linear process,” he adds. “The market is ready. The work is being done. Now it just needs the pieces to fall into place, which is predominately going to be owner driven.”Not everyone is as convinced. The Seattle cornerback Neiko Thorpe remembers that when he played for the Raiders in London four years ago “there was a lot of cheering for just random stuff” – most likely because many fans were new to the game, or were not cheering for either team.There are also logistical issues with any future franchise beyond the fact that London is a long way away. Before their 4,800-mile journey to Heathrow the Seahawks shipped 10 tonnes of cargo to the UK – including 1,150 rolls of athletic tape and 500 pairs of shoes for players and staff. It is one thing doing it for a regular season game, when boxes can be packaged weeks in advance, another during the play-offs. However, the NFL is confident it can steadily chisel away at any obstacles in its path.“This year, for instance, we are playing three matches back-to-back because we have always known that a London team would need to play three or four weekends here followed by three or four in the US to reduce the number of transatlantic trips,” says Waller. “So this is a great opportunity to test the field, the infrastructure and the demand. I think the bigger issues with a London franchise are over attracting the top talent and how players manage families if they are coming over three or four weeks at a time. But I am really comfortable that those things will get solved.”The growth of the game in the UK is certainly a good news story for the NFL but off the field things have not been as rosy. The controversy over players kneeling before games and during the Star Spangled Banner to demonstrate against racial inequality and police brutality continues to simmer, with the NFL giving every impression of not wanting to address such a politically hot potato head on.“The focus now has moved more into what is being done to progress the players’ agenda around social justice and criminal reform,” insists Waller. “If you look at the community work being done by the teams and players to move those agendas forward in their local markets, there is a tremendous amount being done.”The NFL has also been criticised for being too slow to appreciate the dangers of the sport – last season alone there were 291 cases of concussion, an average of more than one a game – while the growing number of former players with the degenerative brain condition CTE is also a major concern.However Waller insists the NFL has been “at the forefront” of making the sport less dangerous. “This year we have definitely focused on taking some of the heavier hitting out of the game and if you look at the results we have the highest scoring start to the season ever,” he says. “Our goal is to find the sweet spot that makes the game safer and yet provides great excitement and entertainment for our fans and I think we are doing that.”Wembley is certainly likely to enjoy a high-scoring game on Sunday, with the Seahawks, led by their star quarterback Russell Wilson, slight favourites to beat the Raiders. While the Raiders coach Jon Gruden admits he would prefer to be playing at home in Los Angeles, he appreciates the greater good of his team’s 11-hour flight to London.“You hate to lose a home game, honestly, but for the betterment of the game, I think it’s exciting,” he says. “It’s great for the game of football.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8b54767b55f66b2a64143fafddc45859db0e309/567_818_2682_1610/master/2682.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4df4542fef36bffb09f105d69f0418bb","title":"reckonings review sadlers wells botis seva julie cunningham alesandra seutin","story":"Sadler’s Wells, LondonThe theatre celebrates its 20th anniversary with three ambitious, striking, heart-lifting new commissions from Botis Seva, Julie Cunningham and Alesandra Seutin To celebrate the 20th anniversary of its building, Sadler’s Wells has eschewed best-ofs in favour of next-big-things, presenting three erse choreographers who put dance firmly in the now.The most impactful piece comes from hip-hop choreographer Botis Seva. In BLKDOG, a murky stage simmers with paranoia. Movement comes in blasts, rupturing uneasy stillness. The dancers wield a powerful, aggressively masculine energy – which is all the more striking because two of them are women.The inspiration is the late Sally Brampton’s memoir about depression, Shoot the Damn Dog, and Seva’s own trials as an artist. He plays with assumptions of black men and street dance, with imagery of guns and violence, while summoning up the helplessness and fear that turn vulnerable young men into bullies and victims. A heavy darkness oppresses the stage – you can see the influence of Hofesh Shechter, who has mentored Seva, but his is nonetheless a strong original voice.In my, Julie Cunningham makes a break with the style of her prime influence (and namesake), Merce Cunningham, especially in its opening phrases when the bodies move in exciting little electrical bursts and sketchy impulses.Cunningham seeks to erase embedded patriarchal structures and fixed gender identities. The result, perhaps inevitably, is amorphous, its strange atmosphere amplified by the reverb-y, feedback-y soundtrack (why are choreographers so enamoured of these?). Its six women occasionally all set their arresting gaze upon the audience, at other times they’re involved in their own small worlds, emotionally neutral until a final scene in which they all start skipping as one in a way that lifts the heart. It is a serious half-hour, but an intriguing next step for Cunningham.Alesandra Seutin’s Boy Breaking Glass brings more heart-lifting moments, thanks to its fantastically full-bodied Senegalese and southern African dance. Her ambitious desire, however, to reflect the challenges, prejudices and solutions facing “brown bodies” is too much to chew. It is better to tell a bigger story through specificity, or you risk saying very little at all – although those revelatory moments of sudden light and joy sweep away all else.Imperfect works, but three talented, confident choreographers and a theatre looking in the right direction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab21018f36390bc4cd093736b6c80a4913fefe3/229_88_3137_1883/master/3137.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=511224f4cb999f6fdfef84fbe23c3b0c","title":"how tv covered princess eugenie royal wedding this morning bbc","story":"The BBC preferred to show A1: Britain’s Longest Road, but ITV pulled out all the stops, or at least gave over a portion of This Morning to cover itRemember the last royal wedding? Glorious, wasn’t it? A moment of perfect choreography, offering us sunshine, tradition, celebrity and a demonstration of the purity of love. For just a moment, it managed to heal a troubled nation. “We should do this again soon!” people cooed at the time, awed by an overwhelming spirit of unbridled optimism.Well, guess what? We just did it again. In a note-for-note recreation of Harry and Meghan’s nuptials, Princess Thingy just got married to some bloke in Windsor Castle and … it probably isn’t a great idea to draw too many comparisons.Especially when it comes to media coverage. Harry and Meghan’s wedding was unavoidable, splayed out live across multiple channels simultaneously for hours on end. This one, though? Confined to ITV only. Worse, it didn’t even warrant its own slot, instead being folded into an episode of This Morning. Even worse than that, it was an episode of This Morning presented by substitute hosts Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford. That’s how second-rate this wedding was they couldn’t even rouse Philip Schofield for it.Why ITV? Perhaps it was because the other channels had their own pressing issues to deal with. As Princess Eugenie walked up the aisle, BBC One – which reportedly rejected Prince Andrew’s specific request to broadcast the ceremony – were showing Homes Under the Hammer followed by A1: Britain’s Longest Road. Why give that double bill up for something as trivial as a royal wedding?Still, this was ITV’s chance to show that it could equal the reverent displays of experts and Dimblebys that the BBC usually flings at occasions like this. And it’s fair to say that it had a good crack. Reporters were flung around Windsor to describe the atmosphere. This Morning’s theme tune was played by a string quartet and timpani. And the hosts? Well, again, maybe let’s not dwell on that either.“It is blowy,” Holmes sighed by way of introduction, as a camera listlessly scanned around a crowd of about six well-wishers. “It’s not the same as Meghan and Harry,” he added a moment later, more in resignation than sadness. Then Ruth mispronounced Eugenie’s name and they went to a Matalan commercial.But let’s not get too downhearted. The last wedding seamlessly managed to blur the line between royalty and celebrity, so surely at the very least we would have some famous faces to spot in the chapel. However, what we got was a relatively upscale Celebrity Come Dine With Me lineup. There was Demi Moore, dressed as the mistress who turns up 10 minutes late to a married man’s funeral. There was Liv Tyler (“From Armageddon,” said Holmes, helpfully). And there was …“The top of Kate Moss’s head, there,” shrugged Holmes as the cameras flailed around looking for someone – anyone – to get excited about. It lingered on a young woman for a moment. “I don’t know who that is,” sniffed Ruth. A nation – or at least the fraction of the percentage of the nation who didn’t have anything better to do – nodded in agreement.This Morning quite sensibly chose not to summon too many royal experts, possibly because they would have all said: “This makes absolutely no difference to anything.” Instead, a huge chunk of the show was dedicated to slightly desperate justifications of the wedding itself. At one point, a panel of guests took turns to rationalise the decision to televise a wedding of a woman whose name nobody – not even the self-styled “world’s most biggest monarchist”, previously interviewed – can pronounce.“Remember that she is a blood princess,” one said. “She’s ninth in line to the throne, and Harry is only sixth, so there’s not a lot of difference,” panted another. “It’s taking place at St George’s chapel, and St George is our patron saint,” offered a third, instantly transforming into the human equivalent of the ¯\\_(ツ)_¯ emoticon.As the royal family spattered in – driving straight up to the chapel’s entrance rather than strolling in like proles – the hosts were forced to share scraps of thin gruel. Lots of time was dedicated to the sight of Prince William briefly holding his wife’s hand. A child was blown over by the wind, and everyone lost their minds with excitement. The groom, Jack Brooksbank, arrived in a car, shooting past the temporary studio on the way in. “He promised us a wave,” growled Holmes, craning his neck. “He lied. he lied.”And then Eugenie turned up, and Brooksbank grinned in delight, and everyone looked so happy and nervous and, fine, it worked, OK? Weddings are great. It’s hard to be cynical at a wedding. As Jack awkwardly played with his hands and Beatrice threw everything into her slightly odd Great Gatsby reading, it was hard not to think the same thing that everyone thought all the way back in May. Maybe we really should do this again soon.The wedding ended. As Mr and Mrs Brooksbank entered their carriage to leave, Ruth murmured: “They promised us a wave” to the viewers. But there was no wave. Maybe next time, guys. Maybe next time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36899ca82f5165f4d800841cb27c62c0c12c91f5/0_0_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=911f75cf9a119881960ddd0ea5871922","title":"hurricane michael marianna florida aftermath","story":"Marianna, the ‘city of southern charm’, saw Hurricane Michael pass directly through, leaving behind shredded bricks and a matted mess of tangled cablesThere’s an unmistakable scent of barbecue and pine down Kelson Avenue in Marianna, Florida, and the faint hum and buzz of generators and chainsaws all around. On the corner, residents of an apartment complex have pooled the remaining meat in their fridge and freezers to cook.“Your food is gonna go bad so we might as well cook it,” said Robert Hill. “Plus it brings you closer as a community.”Marianna, the “city of southern charm”, saw Hurricane Michael’s destructive eye wall pass directly overhead this week, lashing trees into kindling, tearing roofs and awnings, punching through signs and leaving the city’s power grid a matted mess of tangled cable.“It’s like a bomb hit, everywhere you look it’s just devastation,” said Hill who, amid the muted celebratory feeling of the impromptu cookout, had an ominous warning. “Today is the best day we’re going to have. Tomorrow is going to be rough,” Hill said. “We just used the food that was in the freezer, so tomorrow it’s not gonna be there. The store’s not gonna be open and you won’t be able to get cash out the ATM neither.”Not a single store appeared to be open in the city on Thursday, with the downtown corridor of Lafayette Street utterly in tatters. On one corner, a brick building housing an Edward Jones financial office had its bricks shredded by Michael, in a heap on the pavement, with most of the second story obliterated. Multiple building faces had been ripped clear off, now resembling doll houses, and revealing floors bowed by Michael’s destructive power.Down the road, the Jackson county courthouse was a tangled mess with overturned benches and flattened historical marker signs. To the left of the entrance, Michael managed to do something that more often happens via protest, civil disobedience or political pressure – it felled a memorial to Confederate soldiers, snapping it at its base.Business owner Bugra Demirel recalled riding out the storm in his Brothers Beauty \u0026amp Fashion store. “I have not been scared this much in my life. This building started shaking like this,” motioning his hands, “and the sound of the wind …” he shook his head.His newly built store was mostly unscathed but he watched as other businesses on the drag were decimated, like the piano tuning shop across the street. “We saw the roof literally get sucked up and it just flew away,” Demirel said.“Corporate stores – they have contents insurance, building insurance … they’ll be fine, but these guys – mom and pop stores – I’m just thinking about all of them right now. Even us, tomorrow we have to start calling the banks, suppliers – they’re going to have to work with us.”The main streets were cleared of debris first, but on Thursday residential neighborhoods remained largely impassable by car thanks to downed trees, or at least required a number of detours. Off Russ Street, the Bigale family let me accompany them to see their home for the first time since most of them evacuated to Birmingham, Alabama, on Wednesday morning. Allison and Bonnie Bigale almost simultaneously let out an “Oh my God” as they walked into their home and saw the missing piece of ceiling and the dried crusty deposits of drywall gypsum on the floor.Allison Bigale’s husband Adam, a facilities manager at a nearby prison, had to work and was unable to evacuate. He had mostly cleaned up the damage by the time the rest of the family arrived. Bonnie sniffled as she walked into her room – a sloppy mess of ceiling chunks was scattered all over her bed.“But you know what,” Adam said, “we’re all still here so it doesn’t matter. All this is replaceable.”That’s a common attitude in Marianna. “To me, when I got to see that house and it’s still standing, and all our valuables – the things that can’t be replaced – are still there, dude, I’m happy,” said Jeffrey Register. “I’ve lived here 46 years and I had no idea it could be this bad.”Register said he and his family walked a couple of miles on Thursday morning “over, under and through trees – like a hike – just to make sure we still had a house”. His wife, Shalon, sells home insurance and said claims were already starting to trickle in. “It’s gonna be nonstop,” she said.They had been out since 6am moving trees, raking and gathering up debris like much of their block down Cedar Street – at least from what can be seen on this side. Cedar was completely blocked off five houses down by a massive oak tree across the road.Some friends and neighbors stop by and exchange tales of damage, and rumors about when the lights will come back on. Some have heard a week. Others have heard three to four weeks.Behind their place at least 10 pines are splayed out over one another, some still on a neighbor’s roof. The storm flattened their lawnmower shed into a heap and flipped their grandson Kaeden’s swing set several times.“There go the top of it right there,” he yells excitedly, pointing at a thick heap of downed pines. They stopped it from blowing all the way away.“Never seen anything like this in my 23 years here,” White said. “They’ll be talking about this one in Marianna for years to come.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f021d5d158195249562ab3c772c6589da6d2c44e/0_316_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eecc7105eae582260c524015220b42b6","title":"armistice day 100 years on share your letters stories and photographs","story":"Whether your family members or friends were in active service, or in some supporting role at home or abroad, we’d like to hear their storiesSunday 11 November this year will mark 100 years since the armistice treaty was signed between first world war allies and Germany, bringing to an end four years of war in western Europe.On that day people in Britain celebrated by pouring out onto the streets and gathering in large places. Church bells were rung in towns and villages across the UK, for the first time since the war began, both as a symbolic gesture and to let people know the war was over.Though this was a joyous moment for the allies at least, the devastating loss of life affected many families and communities in Britain and across the world.

Half an hour before he arrived for his appointment, Turkish national staff working in the building were told to take the rest of the day off.As mobile phones are not allowed inside the diplomatic building, Khashoggi left his iPhone with his fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, who was to wait for him outside, and told her to raise the alarm if he did not emerge after more than four hours. He kept on his person an Apple watch synced to his phone, which Turkish officials have said is now a focus of the investigation.Khashoggi entered through the main door, was greeted by an official and ushered to the consul general’s office. Turkish officials have told Middle East Eye that two men then entered the room and dragged Khashoggi to another where they killed him. His body was taken to a third room where it was dismembered, the officials said. The hit squad reportedly brought a bone saw with them for the purpose.Several outlets have reported that Khashoggi was tortured before he was killed. Al-Jazeera said a consulate source in the building at the time heard screams and calls for help before a “sudden silence”.Cengiz waited outside until about 1am for Khashoggi to return.Sources have told the  that six cars with diplomatic plates were thought to have carried the Saudi officials and Khashoggi or his body to the consul general’s house on Meselik Street, 200 metres away. Staff at the house were surprised to be asked not to come to work that day.All of the cars spent several hours in a garage under the house. Four are thought to be of interest to the murder inquiry. Prosecutors are considering digging up the garden of the consular residence in the search for Khashoggi’s remains.Despite having booked rooms for three nights, the Saudi team collected their belongings and checked out of the hotels on Tuesday evening. The two private jets later left Istanbul Atatürk airport, one travelling via Cairo and the other via Dubai, with both arriving in Riyadh the next day.Saudi officials have said the many allegations are baseless. Riyadh maintains that Khashoggi left the consulate soon after he arrived and the authorities do not know where he is.Turkey began delicate inquiries into Khashoggi’s disappearance, requesting Saudi Arabia’s help and permission to search the six-storey consulate building.On Friday, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman said in an interview with Bloomberg in Riyadh that the Turkish authorities were welcome to search the consulate building. He declined to say whether Khashoggi was facing any charges at home, adding: “If he’s in Saudi Arabia, I would know that.”The Reuters news agency was given a tour of the Saudi consulate on Saturday to prove that the missing journalist was not being detained there. In the afternoon, Turkish prosecutors confirmed that an investigation had been opened.At about midnight, Turkish officials leaked to news outlets that their intelligence suggested Khashoggi had been killed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2ccd29a21a4ca78e255da713fcd8ba3ac16879e/0_150_6360_3816/master/6360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3c9126be4bc9d21d876456673d2c583","title":"italy matteo salvini little ethnic shops foreigners","story":"Minister calls late-night stores mostly run by foreigners ‘meeting place for drug deals’Italy’s far-right interior minister has come under fire for a proposal that would force what he calls “little ethnic shops” to close by 9pm.Matteo Salvini added the measure to his immigrant-targeting security decree, arguing late-night grocery stores, mostly run by foreigners, are “a meeting place for drug deals and people who raise hell”.He claimed the initiative was not specifically aimed at foreigners and was merely a way to “limit the abuses of certain shops”.Thousands of grocery stores across Italy are run by immigrants, mainly people from Bangladesh and India, many of whom bought premises for a low price during the financial crisis.Mauro Bussoni, the general secretary of Confesercenti, a retail association, said: “You can’t make a law that discriminates some entrepreneurs over others.“Those who have a commercial activity have rights and duties: the duty to respect rules and the right to remain open, whether the activity is managed by a foreigner or an Italian.”Carlo Rienzi, the president of Codacons, a consumer association, said it was unfair to “generalise”, while noting shops that stayed open late were essential for people seeking “last-minute” purchases. But he agreed there should be a clampdown on outlets that have “created disorder” or “degraded” historical town centres.Andrea Marcucci, a politician from the centre-left Democratic party, said imposing curfews was among the premises of “a regime”.If the proposal became law, an industry source said, it should also apply to Italian-owned outlets, including bars, while security measures must also extend to foreign business owners.“Some say that Italian people go into their shop late at night and try to extort money from them,” said the source. “But they are too afraid to report such incidents to the police.”Salvini’s security decree, unveiled in September, includes plans to abolish key protections for immigrants and make it easier for them to be deported.On Thursday, he reiterated a plan to hire 10,000 more police officers, an initiative funded by money that previously paid for migrant reception and integration projects. Parliament has until mid-November to debate and modify the decree before it becomes law.Salvini’s latest proposal comes after Luigi Di Maio, his coalition partner, said measures would be introduced by the end of the year to limit Sunday trading in an attempt to preserve family traditions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/009edc5eb9a94be620ef842723600022c20b1334/0_204_4336_2602/master/4336.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b2ff501d0a197baef912028851f672b","title":"saudi arabia fii conference withdrawal jamal khashoggi","story":"World Bank joins CNN and Financial Times in pulling out of kingdom’s showpiece investment eventA high-profile investment summit in Riyadh later this month is rapidly becoming a fiasco as prominent businesses and media groups have pulled out over Saudi Arabia’s alleged involvement in the disappearance and possible murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.The president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, said he would not be attending, and the Financial Times, Bloomberg, CNN and CNBC have withdrawn as media sponsors.The world’s business elite were due to attend the Future Investment Initiative (FII), which begins in the Saudi capital on 23 October. However, some of the companies involved say they are withdrawing pending the outcome of investigations into Khashoggi’s disappearance, while others have pulled out unconditionally.Saudi Arabia’s ambitious Vision 2030 project – the brainchild of the kingdom’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman – is strongly dependent on overseas investment, and the apparent shunning of the prestigious FII conference will be as disturbing to Saudi policymakers as the more distant threat of a US-imposed ban on arms sales.Jamal Khashoggi is one of the Arab world’s most prominent journalists and commentators. He is an outspoken critic of\u0026nbspSaudi Arabia\u0026nbspwho has dared to defy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler.While living in Saudi Arabia, Khashoggi was told to stop writing or posting on Twitter, where he has more than 1.6 million followers. He moved to the US more than a year ago, where he continued to comment on his country both in print and on television. He wrote columns for the Washington Post and\u0026nbspthe .His message struck a nuanced tone in the US, where he tried to acknowledge the reforms undertaken by Bin Salman while also highlighting the flaws.Khashoggi previously had close links with the Saudi royal family, including having served as a media aide to Prince Turki al-Faisal, when the latter was director general of the Saudi intelligence agency.He is also a former editor of the Saudi newspaper al-Watan and had worked with Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a grandson of the first Saudi king who was detained last year as part of what the authorities said was an anti-corruption campaign.The New York Times withdrew its sponsorship of the event on Wednesday, starting a domino effect of withdrawals around the globe. In a short statement, the Financial Times’ chief communications officer, Fiona McDonnell, said the newspaper would not be a partner of the conference while Khashoggi’s disappearance remained unexplained.Media figures to pull out of the conference include Arianna Huffington, who runs the health firm Thrive Global, Patrick Soon-Shiong, the owner of the LA Times, and the CNBC anchor Andrew Ross Sorkin. The Viacom chief executive, Bob Bakish, and Uber’s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, have also confirmed they will not attend.“I’m very troubled by the reports to date about Jamal Khashoggi,” Khosrowshahi said in a statement late on Thursday. “We are following the situation closely, and unless a substantially different set of facts emerges, I won’t be attending the FII conference in Riyadh.” Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund is a major investor in Uber.The US treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, said on Friday that he was still planning to attend. “If more information comes out and changes, we can look at that, but I am planning on going,” he told CNBC on Friday.The conference organizers removed all the names of attendees from its website as the number of cancellations grew.“Whilst it is disappointing that some speakers and partners have pulled out, we are looking forward to welcoming thousands of speakers, moderators and guests from all over the world to Riyadh,” an FII spokesperson said.Sir Richard Branson has halted discussions with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund about a planned $1bn (£760m) investment in Virgin’s space companies.

With multiple armed groups active in the region, health officials have said they are effectively operating in a war zone.“This is a sign not only that the outbreak is not under control, but that without full engagement from the community things could get a lot worse,” said Dr Michelle Gayer, the IRC’s senior director of emergency health.Earlier this week, the World Health Organization said that 19 of the health workers who had caught Ebola in this epidemic had been infected outside of hospitals or clinics, meaning the virus is spreading in the community.WHO warned that the risk of Ebola’s regional spread was very high, pointing out that DRC’s affected North Kivu and Ituri provinces share borders with Uganda and Rwanda. WHO said the risk for international spread remained low.Ebola is a haemorrhagic fever that spreads through contact with the bodily fluids of its victims and typically kills about half of those it infects."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c69f7a6f449c2b6420e6039ce5e310188f1c790/142_478_2484_1491/master/2484.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=709bf272292f8cdc2ab252b135a91353","title":"teens tiaras quinceanera celebrations cuba havana diana markosian in pictures","story":"The quinceañera, the 15th birthday rite of passage into womanhood, is widely celebrated in Latino culture.

Photograph: Michael McHughPANorthern Ireland officials would be consulted on changing EU rules every month in a joint EU-UK working group under a post-Brexit “backstop” being worked on by Brussels to avoid a hard border. The proposal is among a series of ideas being considered in negotiations between the EU and UK as both sides attempt to break the deadlock over the Irish Border issue to reach a deal on the withdrawal agreement covering the UK’s exit from the EU. EU negotiators are trying to hammer out a legal text with the UK on a backstop – the last-resort option to maintain an invisible border if no better solution is found or it is not solved in a EU-UK trade deal. European Commission negotiators are attempting to find ways of keeping Northern Ireland aligned with the changing rules of the customs union and parts of the single market under their proposed backstop. This would mean that the regulations in Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland would be matched to avoid the need for checks along the Border. One solution would be to create a joint working party comprising EU officials and Northern Irish or British government officials that would meet every month to discuss and consider changes in regulations in Northern IrelandUK and in the EU to maintain regulatory alignment north and south. It would ensure that, under the backstop, Northern Ireland’s interests would be protected under any changes to trade rules arising from any future free trade agreements signed by either the EU or UK. Under this proposal, Northern Ireland would not have a role in the decision-making process around rule changes at EU level but would be consulted in much the same way that Norway operates as a rule-taker from the EU as a European Economic Area (EEA) member to sell goods into the EU’s internal market. The consultations are being proposed as part of efforts to “de-dramatise” the EU’s backstop to make it more politically palatable to Theresa May’s Conservative government in London and the Democratic Unionist Party, which is keeping her party in power at Westminster. EEA membership offers countries full access to the EU single market, and the backstop arrangement being considered for Northern Ireland after Brexit under the backstop proposed by Brussels would allow it, like Norway, trade goods with EU states without customs fees being imposed. More crucially, it would remove the need for a border with the EU along the 499km frontier with the Republic of Ireland, the objective of the negotiations around this fallback option should a future EU-UK trading relationship remove the need for Border checks. Negotiations around the backstop – the final sticking point on finding an agreement on a Brexit treaty – are expected to continue over the weekend in an effort to find a solution that could be put to EU leaders at a crunch summit in Brussels next Wednesday. The EU’s proposed backstop – keeping Northern Ireland effectively in the EU customs union and maintaining access to parts of the single market – has been rejected by the Conservatives and unionists who argue that it would split Northern Ireland economically and constitutionally from the rest of the UK. London’s preference for the backstop is for temporary membership of the customs union for the UK as a whole. Brussels and Dublin have rejected this saying that a backstop guaranteeing an invisible Irish Border must be in place unless and until a comprehensive agreement on a future relationship is agreed and that agreement covers the same safeguards needed to preserve a frictionless border. The UK’s proposal also complicates matters in Brussels because if the EU were to agree to the UK possibly staying in the customs union indefinitely under a backstop, it might prejudge negotiations on the future EU-UK trading relationship where the purpose of article 50 Brexit negotiations should be limited solely to the UK’s withdrawal and not deal with its future relations with the EU."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3661484.1539355903!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit explained what is theresa may s chequers plan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May and members of her Cabinet in her country retreat Chequers in July 2018. Photograph: Joel Rouse via Getty ImagesThe Chequers Plan was tabled by British prime minister Theresa May at Chequers, the prime minister’s country retreat north west of London, and agreed by her cabinet in early July 2018. The plan, officially named “The Future Relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, ” details how she sees the UK’s trading relationship with the EU working after Britain formally leaves the economic bloc in March 2019.May wants to create a “common rule book” for industrial goods and agricultural products that would mean Britain would have to sign up to EU rules for manufactured goods, food and other farm produce without having a say in determining those rules. This would give the UK access to the EU single market and its 500 million consumers for all goods, including food and drink. A “facilitated customs arrangement” between the UK and the EU would remove the need for customs checks and controls between them, operating as a “combined customs territory” or tariff-free area. The UK would charge its own tariffs and trade policies for goods heading to the UK and it would collect EU tariffs on EU-bound goods coming into the UK on behalf of the EU. The plan would allow the UK develop an independent trade policy with the rest of the world, fulfilling the Brexiteer promise to be able to agree trade deals with other countries. Under the proposal, there is no plan for services such as banking and finance, which makes up 80 per cent of the UK’s economy and which the country exports right across the EU. May proposed dealing with services under a separate arrangement that would give the UK much more flexibility to set its own rules, “recognising the UK and the EU will not have current levels of access to each other’s markets.”Under the proposal, goods would travel more or less unhindered across the EU-UK border so Britain sees the Chequers plan as ensuring co-operation on trade which would solve the Irish Border question, one of the most intractable problems that has so far proven impossible to solve by EU and UK negotiators.The proposal, creating a free trade area of goods between the EU and UK, would effectively continue existing regulatory and customs arrangements for industrial and food products after Brexit as the UK would agree to accept future regulations agreed in Brussels by making an up-front commitment, by way of a treaty, to “ongoing harmonisation with EU rules.”Yes. It is similar to the arrangement that Norway, which is outside the EU but inside the European Economic Area, has with the bloc. Norway makes a contribution to the EU budget and abides by EU rules - most often referred to as a “rule-taker” - and the rulings of the European Court of Justice, which enforces them, in exchange for having access to the single market.No. The UK proposes establishing a “joint institutional framework” to interpret agreements between the EU and the UK that would be done by each side’s respective courts. UK courts would pay “due regard” to EU case law in areas where the common rulebook continued to apply and cases would still be referred to the European Court of Justice as the interpreter of EU rules, but disputes would be resolved through a “Joint Committee” and neither an EU court or UK court could resolve disputes between the two.Yes. The UK parliament, under the Chequers plan, would be able to block any changes to the EU rules “recognising that this would have consequences.” The plan would also mean the UK would no longer agree to the EU rule covering the free movement of people across borders, a key demand for hardline Brexit supporters and eroding one of the EU’s “four freedoms” - free movement of goods, services and capital are the others - set by Brussels for having access to the single market.Not well. The EU said that while it had some positive elements, it was unworkable, arguing that Britain was essentially cherry-picking EU rules it liked for access to the single market and choosing not to accept others. Brussels fears that the UK businesses would be given an unfair advantage over their EU competitors if the UK only has to apply some EU rules and not others, for example on environmental protections. The EU is also concerned about a third country outside the reach of its supervision and beyond the remit of the European Court of Justice controlling its borders and collecting tariffs on its behalf.Not universally well. It led to the resignation of two senior cabinet members, Brexit secretary David Davis and foreign secretary Boris Johnson. Davis argued that adhering to EU rules would leave Britain’s “fingers caught in this mangle” and render control of the British parliament over UK law “more illusory that real.” More controversially, Johnson said that the plan “wrapped a suicide vest” around the British constitution and “handed the detonator” to Brussels. He has called on May to “chuck Chequers.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Julien Behal British and European Union negotiators are meeting throughout the weekend in an attempt to agree the text of a Northern Ireland Brexit backstop ahead of next Wednesday’s summit in Brussels. Downing Street said on Friday that Theresa May would not agree to any deal that kept Britain indefinitely within a customs union with the EU. “The prime minister would never agree to a deal which would trap the UK in a backstop permanently,” Mrs May’s official spokeswoman said.The spokeswoman said Britain wanted a temporary customs arrangement for the whole of the UK written into the legal text of the withdrawal agreement as part of the backstop. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said consistently that the backstop must be specific to Northern Ireland and that customs arrangements for the whole of the UK should be part of a political declaration about the future relationship between Britain and the EU.Mr Barnier’s deputy, Sabine Weyand, on Friday night updated EU ambassadors about the negotiations, which are expected to continue into Monday. Mrs May met members of her inner cabinet on Thursday evening but she did not seek their support for any new negotiating position.Conservative Brexiteers, including some cabinet ministers, are alarmed by reports that Mrs May is preparing to accept that the backstop, including an all-UK customs arrangement, will have no explicit time limit.Brexit secretary\u0026nbspDominic Raab said on Friday that any backstop must be time-limited. “It would have to be finite, it would have to be short and it would have to be, I think, time-limited in order for it to be supported here,” he said.“What we cannot do is see the United Kingdom locked in via the backdoor to a customs union arrangement which would leave us in an indefinite limbo – that would not be leaving the EU.”\u0026nbspMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said the backstop, which is designed to guarantee that there will be no hard border in any circumstances, cannot by definition be time-limited.“If the issues aren’t resolved in three years you can’t do away with the insurance mechanism. We can’t accept a time limit, but we can accept it will only be there unless and until something better is agreed in the future, which is what everyone wants,” he told Sky News.Mr Coveney also criticised the weight being given in public discourse to the DUP’s threats to withdraw support for the Conservative government if it is unhappy with the backstop. “The DUP represents a minority of people in Northern Ireland,” he said.“The majority of people in Northern Ireland are looking for something quite different from what the DUP is looking for, and yet the DUP is given this platform as if it speaks for Northern Ireland.”Northern Ireland could face power cuts in the event of a no-deal Brexit, according to the latest batch of technical notices from the British government. There is a single electricity market on the island of Ireland and the British government would try to work with Dublin to ensure that current arrangements could continue after a no-deal Brexit.If such an agreement was not possible, Britain would seek to ensure an adequate electricity supply to Northern Ireland, including “demand-side measures” that would limit electricity use."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3661332.1539346923!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"royal wedding celebrities join royalty as princess eugenie marries","story":"Queen Elizabeth\u0027s grand daughter Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank marry at St George\u0027s chapel, Windsor.

Photograph: PA Queen Elizabeth’s granddaughter Princess Eugenie married wine merchant Jack Brooksbank at Windsor Castle on Friday in front of celebrities and Britain’s senior royals including Prince Harry and wife Meghan who wed at the same venue in May.Eugenie (28) younger daughter of the queen’s third child, Prince Andrew, and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, tied the knot with Brooksbank (32), in a traditional ceremony in the castle’s 15th century St George’s Chapel.It was the same setting as Harry and Meghan’s wedding in May, and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as the couple are now known, were among the star-studded congregation.The 92-year-old queen and her husband Philip (97), who has retired from official engagements, were joined by other royals and celebrities including Hollywood stars Liv Tyler and Demi Moore, models Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell and singer Ellie Goulding.Female guests had to cling on to their hats as a blustery wind threatened their wedding outfits and a page boy tripped on the stairs walking into the chapel.Eugenie’s dress, by Peter Pilotto and Christopher De Vos of the London-based label Peter Pilotto, had a low back to reveal scars from surgery she underwent to correct scoliosis when she was 12.“It’s a lovely way to honour the people who looked after me and a way of standing up for young people who also go through this,” she told ITV’s This Morning ahead of the wedding.The couple, while showing clear signs on nerves, beamed happily during the hour-long service.“This is meant to be a family wedding,” Eugenie’s father Andrew said earlier.“There will be a few more people than most people have, there are a few more than Harry had, but that’s just the nature of Eugenie and Jack - they’ve got so many friends that they need a church of that size to fit them all in,” he told “This Morning” which broadcast the event live.Several hundred singing and cheering well-wishers gathered outside in Windsor in the shadow of the castle, far fewer than the thousands that crammed into the town for Harry’s wedding.“I’m a true royalist,” David Weeks (77) bedecked in a Union Jack suit and bowler hat, told Reuters. “I was here for the queen’s 90th birthday. I was here for Harry and Meghan’s wedding, I wouldn’t miss it, I love the atmosphere.”The ceremony was conducted by the Dean of Windsor David Conner, and Eugenie’s elder sister, Princess Beatrice, the maid of honour, read an extract from the F Scott Fitzgerald novel The Great Gatsby which the bride had read after meeting her future husband in the Swiss ski resort of Verbier in 2010.“One particular passage in which Jay Gatsby is described reminded her immediately of Jack,” Dean Conner said. “She decided she wanted eventually to let Jack know how much those words had brought him to mind.”One noticeable absentee was Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, the wife of heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, as she was carrying out an engagement in Scotland.Princess Charlotte (3) daughter of Harry’s elder brother Prince William and his wife Kate, was a bridesmaid, and her brother, Prince George (5) a page boy.After the service, the couple took an open-top horse-drawn carriage tour of Windsor before a reception at the castle, hosted by the queen.Eugenie is a director at London’s Hauser \u0026amp Wirth art gallery, and Brooksbank owns a wine wholesale business and is European brand manager for Casamigos Tequila, which was co-founded by US actor George Clooney.Security around Windsor was tight, with airport-style security checks and large numbers of police. As Eugenie does not carry out official royal duties, republicans have said it is wrong that the estimated £2 million pounds (€2.28m) security bill will be paid by taxpayers. –Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"kanye west reveals iphone passcode 000000 oval office meeting","story":"Kanye West has revealed that his iPhone passcode is 000000 during a meeting with Donald Trump in which he said wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat made him feel like Superman. While unlocking his phone to show the president images of the “iPlane 1”, a hydrogen-powered plane which he said should replace Air Force 1, the rapper inadvertently revealed its code to the world’s media. The code is likely to be the weakest possible passcode because it would be the first one tried by anyone attempting to unlock the phone. It would also prompt a warning from Apple if a user attempted to install it. The star also appears not to use Face ID, a feature of newer iPhones which allows a user to unlock a phone by simply holding it in front of their face. In a wide-ranging conversation which covered manufacturing in America, Mr Trump’s presidential campaign, and prison reform, the 41-year-old musician also showed the president several images of the plane.“I bought a gif with me right here,” he told the president, while unlocking his phone.“This right here is the iPlane 1. It’s a hydrogen-powered airplane, and this is what our President should be flying in,” he said, handing the phone to Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law. “We’re going to have Apple, an American company, work on this plane,” West added. The image, which is a concept by a Detroit-based designer, appeared to have been sent to him via text message several times. He also talked about the feeling of wearing Mr Trump’s red ‘Make America Great Again’ cap and about how the president’s 2016 campaign compared to that of Hillary Clinton. He said his parents’ separation had led to a lack of “male energy” in his childhood home.He said: “I love Hillary, I love everyone, right? But the campaign ‘I’m with her’ just didn’t make me feel as a guy, that didn’t get to see my dad all the time, like a guy that could play catch with his son.There was something about when I put this hat on it made me feel like Superman,” he added. That’s my favourite superhero and you made a superman cape for me.He went on to criticise “liberals” and sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live, which frequently mocks Mr Trump.“If he don’t look good, we don’t look good. This is our President,” he said. “He has to be the freshest, the flyest, the flyest planes, the best factories. And we have to make our core be empowered, we have to bring jobs into America.”He added that importing goods from China was “cheating on our country”. “We’re putting people in positions to have to do illegal things, to end up in the cheapest factory ever, the prison system.Please review our commenting policyChina mocks US with proposal to sell American aircraft carriers to Beijing to close trade deficitRoyal wedding: Love wins as Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank begin life as newlyweds - the full story of the dayHow brush with librarian could have prevented Philip Larkin\u0026#39s \u0026#39sex began in 1963\u0026#39 poem being writtenComment: Theresa May is throwing away the biggest political opportunity of our eraEton faces backlash after banning mobile phones in the classroomHeadteachers accused of betraying colleagues by remaining members of \u0026#39sexist\u0026#39 gentleman’s clubHealth warning over rabid bats  after new virus found in the UKComment: Jeremy Corbyn is right, we should teach the British Empire in schools – but let\u0026#39s teach the facts Paradise lost: The Caribbean island drowning in waste and the painstaking battle to clean it upFarmers express concern over major increase in beaver numbersRussia warns of schism in Orthodox Christianity after Ukrainian church granted independenceAmy Winehouse to go on tour six years after her death as father unveils hologram of late singerMet chief defends deputy who locked himself in car during terrorist rampageComment: Selfless, dazzling Eugenie at the centre of a unique and rather lovely royal weddingShale gas fracking to get going in the UK this weekendEx-police officer jailed for 1978 rape in Britain\u0026#39s \u0026#39oldest cold case DNA breakthrough\u0026#39Melania Trump has \u0026#39more important things to think about\u0026#39 than husband\u0026#39s alleged affairsBBC will have more gay characters in its shows to combat \u0026#39heteronormative culture\u0026#39Brexit transition period could be extended by another year, costing UK billions in extra payments to EUHurricane Michael clean-up begins as authorities brace for death toll to riseGuests battle strong winds at Princess Eugenie\u0026#39s weddingWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000177433059_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqTh3H5BemKyhXFKdcxJGxV1FTNNabxLt8zdWE99ykJoY.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"italys hardline deputy pm matteo salvini says little ethnic","story":"Salvini stands next to a sniper rifle during a visit to celebrate the anniversary of the Central Security Operations Service, a SWAT team of the Polizia di Stato in RomeItaly\u0027s hard-line interior minister has called for little ethnic shops - convenience stores run mostly by Asian immigrants - to have to close by 9pm because they are a focus for drug dealers and hell raisers.Matteo Salvini, who is also the head of the anti-immigrant League party, said he would add an amendment to a security bill going through parliament.(There will be an amendment) for the closure by 21:00 of little ethnic shops, which have become a meeting place for drug deals and people who raise hell, Mr Salvini, wrote on Facebook.He denied that the move was racist or specifically targeted at migrant-run businesses.

which led to a 3 per cent hit to GDP and a recessionClick to followThe IndependentBrexit is already hurting the UK economy and crashing out of the European Union with no deal risks a recession, the government’s own independent official forecaster has concluded.“We cannot know for sure what would have happened had the vote gone the other way, but it seems likely that the economy and public finances have been weaker than they otherwise would have been,” said the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in a new report published on Thursday.This is what day one of a no-deal Brexit could look likeThe Bank of England and some independent analysts, including the Centre for European Reform, have suggested\u0026nbspthat the Leave result has held back UK GDP growth by between 2 and 2.5 per cent relative to where it otherwise would have been due to lower household spending, resulting from the spike in inflation after the vote, and lower business investment due to Brexit-related uncertainty.That equates to a GDP loss of up to\u0026nbsp£500m a week, more than what Brexit campaigners said,\u0026nbspmisleadingly,\u0026nbspwould be the benefit to UK tax revenues from no longer paying into the EU budget.The OBR described these calculations as plausible and in line with its own estimates, noting that the UK had slipped from having the highest growth rate in the G7 before the vote, to the lowest now.The OBR’s current growth forecasts are based on the UK achieving an orderly withdrawal process and 21-month transition period next March, during which Britain will remain in the single market and the customs union.It said that the economic consequences of a disorderly no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit next March, which some Brexiteers have been urging, were “next to impossible to calibrate with any confidence”.But it said perhaps the closest historical parallel was the “Three-Day Week”\u0026nbspin early 1974 in response to energy shortages and the threat of a miners’ strike which led to a 3 per cent hit to GDP and a recession.The OBR added that UK share prices could fall “sharply” in such a scenario.“Together with heightened uncertainty about future prospects, that would be likely to lead households and businesses to rein back their spending, while banks and other financial intermediaries would be likely to tighten the supply of credit, further reducing demand,” it said.Theresa May is proposing a free trade deal with the EU to be implemented when the post-Brexit transition phase ends in 2021, but has also insisted that “no-deal is better than a bad deal”.The OBR\u0026nbspalso poured cold water on the idea, promoted by Brexiteers, that any economic hit to the UK in a no-deal Brexit or hard Brexit (where we left the customs union entirely) could be cancelled out by major new free trade deals with other parts of the world.“As well as being challenging to negotiate, the evidence suggests that the benefits of additional bilateral trade deals are likely to be relatively modest – and the impact of any inidual deal may not be material for our forecast,” it said.Office for Budget ResponsibilityShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the

These figures more closely resemble a company’s balance sheet.The IMF said the cost of bailing out banks had been a significant factor dragging the UK down the rankings. The UK also has one of the largest pension liabilities of any nation in the study but is towards the bottom of the pile when it comes to public assets.Using the public sector balance sheet method, countries such as Gambia, Uganda and Kenya rank above the UK because, while they have smaller assets and liabilities than Britain, they have a higher net wealth relative to GDP.The IMF’s report takes particular aim at the privatisation of public assets, the benefits of which it says are often merely an “illusion”.UK economy grows faster than expected in three months to AugustUK economy lost out on £4.5 trillion because of ‘too much finance’Does low-skilled immigration really hurt the UK economy?Remaining in EU better for UK economy than any kind of Brexit says IMFA decade after the financial crisis, the economy needs urgent reformThe UK has undergone one of the most drastic privatisations of any economy since the early 1980s.\u0026nbspUnder the Conservative government since 2015, policy has gone a stage further, incentivising departments and local authorities to sell off assets to fund day-to-day spending under the premise that such an approach is necessary to cut the deficit.But the IMF economists said the tendency of governments to focus on debt “misses large swaths of government activity and can fall victim to illusory fiscal practices”.When public assets are taken into account, selling a public utility,\u0026nbspfor example, may do nothing to improve the public finances, the IMF said.“For instance, privatisations increase revenue and lower deficits but also reduce the government’s asset holdings,” the report stated.\u0026nbsp“Similarly, cutting back maintenance expenditure reduces the deficit and lowers debt, but also reduces the value of infrastructure assets, which could cost more in the long term.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Waves hit Cawsand, Cornwall as Storm Callum arrives to the UKFormer Prime Minister John Major has spoken out against the launch of Universal Credit (the Government\u0027s new benefit model).

These figures more closely resemble a company’s balance sheet.The IMF said the cost of bailing out banks had been a significant factor dragging the UK down the rankings. The UK also has one of the largest pension liabilities of any nation in the study but is towards the bottom of the pile when it comes to public assets.Using the public sector balance sheet method, countries such as Gambia, Uganda and Kenya rank above the UK because, while they have smaller assets and liabilities than Britain, they have a higher net wealth relative to GDP.The IMF’s report takes particular aim at the privatisation of public assets, the benefits of which it says are often merely an “illusion”.UK economy grows faster than expected in three months to AugustUK economy lost out on £4.5 trillion because of ‘too much finance’Does low-skilled immigration really hurt the UK economy?Remaining in EU better for UK economy than any kind of Brexit says IMFA decade after the financial crisis, the economy needs urgent reformThe UK has undergone one of the most drastic privatisations of any economy since the early 1980s.\u0026nbspUnder the Conservative government since 2015, policy has gone a stage further, incentivising departments and local authorities to sell off assets to fund day-to-day spending under the premise that such an approach is necessary to cut the deficit.But the IMF economists said the tendency of governments to focus on debt “misses large swaths of government activity and can fall victim to illusory fiscal practices”.When public assets are taken into account, selling a public utility,\u0026nbspfor example, may do nothing to improve the public finances, the IMF said.“For instance, privatisations increase revenue and lower deficits but also reduce the government’s asset holdings,” the report stated.\u0026nbsp“Similarly, cutting back maintenance expenditure reduces the deficit and lowers debt, but also reduces the value of infrastructure assets, which could cost more in the long term.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Waves hit Cawsand, Cornwall as Storm Callum arrives to the UKFormer Prime Minister John Major has spoken out against the launch of Universal Credit (the Government\u0027s new benefit model).

He’s also a tennis coach.Dacre wasn’t always interested in following in his ancestor’s footsteps – his first love was sports (PA)But at some point, Dacre – who’s now 60 and lives in South Carolina – became fascinated with the brother of his great-grandfather George Stoker, so much so that he’s just co-authored his second book adding to Bram’s canon, a prequel to the most famous book about vampirism ever.But Dracul, published this month by Bantam Press, is not just about the early life of Count Dracula himself. It ties Bram Stoker inextricably into the Dracula legend and posits the fascinating question… what if Bram was producing not just a mere entertainment, but writing from experience?Cowriting with horror author JD Barker, Dacre presents Dracul partly in epistolary form, as the original book is laid out, intermingling the story of a terrified 21-year-old Bram locking himself away from a nightmare that haunts him, his only defences a gun, holy water and a crucifix, with fictionalised entries from Bram’s journal.The journal tells the story of Bram as a sickly child in Dublin, who is put in the care of a sinister nanny and ultimately crosses paths with the children of the night, experiences which would later inform his 1897 novel that has, in real life, become one of the most enduring stories of the past century.It’s great fun, told with aplomb by the two authors, and is weighted with an often uneasy sense of credibility, despite the subject matter, which is all thanks to Dacre’s direct connection to Bram, and the meticulous research he’s carried out into his ancestor’s writings.“Bram became quite a sportsman later in life,” says Dacre. “He was a very sickly child. Imagine if this transformation was due to an infusion of vampire’s blood…”Dacre is currently on a tour of the US promoting Dracul, and when we speak he is in New Orleans, itself considered the haunt of vampires and the quiet undead. It is very early in the day for him, before 7am, but he assures me he is an early riser. Across the road from his hotel is, he tells me, the Lafayette Cemetery, lair of the Mayfair vampires and deadly Lestat in Anne Rice’s celebrated novels. Dacre has become quite the expert on the undead. So how did the sports-mad teen gravitate towards less earthly pursuits?“I think it was when I read In Search of Dracula, a book by two Boston scholars, that I first really felt a connection to Bram and the story of Dracula,” he says. The book, by Radu Florescu and Raymond McNally, was published in 1972 and first made the connections between the fictional Count Dracula and the very real and bloody historical figure of Vlad Tepes of Wallachia.His interest piqued, Dacre began to speak to his cousins and other surviving relatives. “There aren’t many of us,” he says. “Although Bram was one of seven children, not many of them had families of their own.” He pauses. “Fortunately, George, my great-grandfather, did.”In 2003, Dacre was contacted by a screenwriter called Ian Holt, who had been trying to get a film made of a direct sequel to Dracula, but without much success. The pair teamed up and wrote the story as a novel, Dracula the Un-Dead, set 25 years after the original novel. As well as having the sway of an actual Stoker family member involved, the book served to help bring Dracula back into Stoker hands since the 1890 novel the character had become a bit of a pop-cultural free-for-all, and prompted the family to set up the Bram Stoker Estate, which Dacre manages.But the story took an unexpected turn in 2011 when Noel Dobbs, Bram’s great-grandson, discovered hidden away in his home on the Isle of Wight a previously unseen journal kept by the great writer.“That was a pivotal moment for me,” says Dacre. “With Dr Elizabeth Miller I set about deciphering the handwritten entries and from that journal I got to know Bram a lot more intimately. That was probably the most significant point in my relationship with Bram.”Dacre and Dr Miller published the contents of the journal in 2012, and as well as offering an insight into the life and thoughts of the author, it also set Dacre on another journey that would lead to the writing of the new book, Dracul.The journal alerted Dacre to the existence of a preface written by Bram to the original edition of Dracula that was never used by his publishers… and one which suggested that the author might have actually believed in vampires.Dacre – becoming, as he says, a “forensic literary detective” – tracked down the original preface to an Icelandic translation of Dracula and eventually finding a copy of that, something became startlingly apparent. “I believe that Bram realised that many people in history truly believed that vampires were real,” he says. “After Dracula was published, he gave just one interview and in that he said his book ‘touches on mystery and fact’.“We know now that long ago people might not have understood things like the plague or communicable diseases, and these unexplained things might have seemed supernatural to them. I believe Bram was very open-minded, and believed that just because we can’t observe something, it doesn’t mean that it can’t exist.”Dacre quotes from the original Dracula to me, from the scene when Van Helsing is trying to convince Dr Seward that there are things out there beyond human ken. “There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they may solve only in part. Believe me, we are now on the verge of one.”Dacre cowrote ‘Dracul’ with horror author JD Barker (Penguin)From all this, Dacre extrapolated the plot of Dracul, of a young Bram coming into contact with vampirism, and writing Dracula as a result. “Not as a piece of fiction,” says Dacre, “but as a warning to the world.”When the idea was germinating, Dacre met JD Barker, whose debut novel Forsaken was nominated for the Bram Stoker Award for horror fiction. They agreed to collaborate on the idea, with Dacre taking Barker up to his cabin in North Carolina to thrash out the plot. The wisdom of accepting an offer from Bram Stoker’s blood relative to spend time alone in a remote cabin briefly flits across my mind as something to be embarked upon with care, but I don’t voice it, instead asking Dacre what Bram would think of the result.“I really do think he would approve,” he says. “I wanted to show the character of Bram evolve into a hero. He never really liked talking about himself and I think he would like the idea of a relative of his telling the story of his humble beginnings.”As well as managing the Stoker Estate and writing his own books based on Bram’s work, Dacre spends a lot of time attending scholarly conferences and is a regular attendee at the goth weekend in Whitby, where Bram holidayed in 1890 and first got the idea for Dracula. In the book, it is where the vampiric count makes landfall on the ill-fated ship the Demeter. The image of the Demeter crashing into the beach after Dracula has helped himself to most of the crew was based on a true story Bram was told by the fishermen on the harbour, about the Dmitry which beached at Whitby in 1885.Bran Castle: Dracula\u0027s home to be rented out over HalloweenRadu Florescu: Historian who was the first to make the link betweenSherlock\u0027s Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat announce new projectIf Bram Stoker kept an open mind about the real existence of vampires, what about his great grandnephew? “I keep an open mind about a lot of things, too,” he says. What would he do if he met an actual vampire?“I did!” he declares. “Last night! And not just one. There are now people who practise what they call ‘safe vampirism’. They share blood. I was invited to go along to one of their private clubs last night…”Quite what Bram Stoker would have made of that, we can only guess. But my interview with Dacre is at an end. The sun is just beginning to rise, and I wouldn’t want to keep him any longer. Because you just never know for sure…‘Dracul’ by Dacre Stoker and JD Barker\u0026nbspis published on 18 October by Bantam Press, £12.99Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Here, she talks about the project from its roots to its record breaking successesClick to followThe IndependentCher duets with Andy Garcia in a show-stealing scene from the upbeat sequelBack in 1982, I was working with Benny Andersson and Björn\u0026nbspUlvaeus on Chess. I was employed\u0026nbspas Tim Rice’s assistant. Abba had just disbanded and my first job was to go to meet Björn from the airport. I’d always loved the Abba songs but that was when I fell in love with them. Meeting Benny and Björn\u0026nbspand working with them over the next five years, I became extremely interested in those songs, which I think they thought they had left behind, as they were working on other musical projects.When I was younger, I was an Abba fan but I was more into Bowie, and I went through the rock phase of the\u0026nbspLed Zeppelins and the Emerson, Lake and Palmers. I loved “Dancing Queen”\u0026nbspbut I never went to an Abba concert.Mamma Mia 2 star Cher takes a chance on selling her Beverly Hills homeWhy ‘Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again’ is our antidote to BrexitLily James on playing a young Meryl Streep, and singing Abba for AbbaAll the ABBA songs featured in Mamma Mia 2Yet\u0026nbspI was compelled by the songs and by meeting the guys. The song “The Winner Takes it All” was the inspiration for Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspand when I met Björn I wanted to know what must have been going round in his head when he wrote that song.It’s a huge romancebreakup song\u0026nbspa woman having a conversation in her head with a man who has hurt her and let her down or maybe cheated on her. “Tell me does she kiss,\u0026nbsplike\u0026nbspI used to kiss you?” The lyrics are full of hurt it’s a roller coaster of emotions. But how do you make a musical out of a song that is taking you towards Greek tragedy? That’s what I love about Abba songs. They take you on this journey, and even if they hit a certain emotional spot, you’re still left feeling in a good mood.I felt the idea of hearing somebody sing that song in the theatre was like “Don’t Cry For Me Argentina”\u0026nbspit was “the 11 o’clock number “ as they say on Broadway –\u0026nbspthe second act showstopper.Benny and Björn were against anything that would be a tribute or a biographical story but that\u0026nbspdidn’t interest me either. Björn was interested at first more than Benny because the musical was to use\u0026nbsphis lyrics as the source material. Those amazing words took us through the stage show and now two films.It was funny working on the second film because people would say:\u0026nbsp“Are there enough songs?”\u0026nbspI certainly thought there were, and, in fact, I think there’s a whole new audience that didn’t know Abba, didn’t grow up with Abba, didn’t know them as a band and yet\u0026nbspknow those songs as Mamma Mia! That tickles Benny and Björn quite a lot.The girls haven’t been so involved because Benny and Björn wrote the songs. But Frida has always been very supportive. And Agnetha too for that matter.Of course, I was passionate and keen about the show, but I had to work hard to convince people that it wasn’t just a\u0026nbspperformance in which\u0026nbsppeople were going to be dressing up as Frida and Agnetha, and Benny and Björn.I knew those songs worked for two generations. For the younger audience members there was “Honey Honey” and “Dancing Queen”, the dancing songs. And then there’s the\u0026nbspmore emotional breakup songs, perhaps for older fans. I toyed with different ideas\u0026nbspthen in the mid-Nineties, Björn\u0026nbsptold me that\u0026nbspif I could\u0026nbspfind the right story\u0026nbsphe and Benny\u0026nbspmight be interested.That’s when I met playwright Catherine Johnson and pitched all my thoughts to her about generations, and how the theme of the production\u0026nbsphad to be weddings or holidays. I felt it had to be something nostalgic that took you to a happy place and Catherine\u0026nbspcame up with the genius mother-daughter idea\u0026nbspset around a wedding, and examining the relationship between a\u0026nbspmother and a daughter\u0026nbsp– and\u0026nbspthree possible fathers. And that immediately appealed to Björn and Benny.I hadn’t thought at that stage of the possibility of it becoming a film – I thought it might make a small TV film. But I always had a pull towards a stage show. And now I’ve overseen\u0026nbsp50 productions.The stakes were high because Mamma Mia! had done 20 years in London\u0026nbspand the first movie had been one of the most successful musical films ever.I had seen Love Actually. I adored Richard Curtis’s work. If we were to do another film we had to explore different emotions, and he is so brilliant not just at romance but also taking risks on life and loss: at the heart of all his comedies is\u0026nbsploss. He thought about this in the sense of going back and forth and to different places,\u0026nbspand all he had to say to me was “The Godfather: Part II” and I completely got it.You have to have ‘Dancing Queen’. Why would you go to see your favourite band if they’re not going to play your favourite songs?Even the music is like The Godfather: Part II\u0026nbsprich sweeping ballads. It underscores. There’s a rich palate of Abba in there.It was always the intention to reuse songs from the first film. You have to have “Dancing Queen”. Why would you go to see your favourite band if they’re not going to play your favourite songs?There were songs that I knew still had the power of storytelling and also the power of comedy,\u0026nbspsomething fun that has come from the stage show,\u0026nbspwhether it’s “Chiquitita” or “Take a Chance”.\u0026nbspBrosnan (PA)Curtis said he loved Mamma Mia! and\u0026nbspAbba\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspand though he didn’t have time to write the screenplay\u0026nbsphimself, he\u0026nbspwas happy to support our endeavours, especially if there was a writer he liked and wanted to work with. That person was Ol Parker, who came on board as a writer at that time (and then later became the director).So, it was a matter of making the story work.\u0026nbspMeryl Streep\u0026nbsphad always been affectionate towards the original\u0026nbspMamma Mia! and was keen on being in a possible\u0026nbspsequel but I knew she was never\u0026nbspgoing to take on a role as big as the first one. And for her to be part of it, what song? You can’t really top “The Winner Takes it All” from the first film, and she wasn’t going to be running along rooftops and jumping off cliffs singing lots of Abba songs. “My Love, My Life” is an incredibly affecting song and I think equal to “The Winner Takes it All”.Created with Sketch.ABBA: Eurovision victory in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Abba performs their song Waterloo during the Eurovision Song ContestAbba congratulate each other in Brighton, after winning the Eurovision Song ContestABBA give the thumbs up after winning the Eurovision Song Contest with their song \u0027Waterloo\u0027ABBA posing at Waterloo railway station.Anna and Frida singing Sweden\u0027s entry, Waterloo, during a dress rehearsal in BrightonAbba meet a mounted policeman as they relax in Brighton, after their victory in the Eurovision Song ContestABBA in BrightonAbba congratulate each other in Brighton, after winning the Eurovision Song ContestABBA during a photocall in London to promote their song \u0027Waterloo\u0027 before the Eurovision song contestBenny Andersson, Anni-Frid Lyngstad, Agnetha Faltskog and Bjorn Ulvaeus posing at Waterloo railway stationAbba strolling hand in hand amongst the daffodils in Hyde ParkAbba after winning the Eurovision Song Contest in BrightonAbba arriving at London Airport Abba performs their song Waterloo during the Eurovision Song ContestAbba congratulate each other in Brighton, after winning the Eurovision Song ContestABBA give the thumbs up after winning the Eurovision Song Contest with their song \u0027Waterloo\u0027ABBA posing at Waterloo railway station.Anna and Frida singing Sweden\u0027s entry, Waterloo, during a dress rehearsal in BrightonAbba meet a mounted policeman as they relax in Brighton, after their victory in the Eurovision Song ContestABBA in BrightonAbba congratulate each other in Brighton, after winning the Eurovision Song ContestABBA during a photocall in London to promote their song \u0027Waterloo\u0027 before the Eurovision song contestBenny Andersson, Anni-Frid Lyngstad, Agnetha Faltskog and Bjorn Ulvaeus posing at Waterloo railway stationAbba strolling hand in hand amongst the daffodils in Hyde ParkAbba after winning the Eurovision Song Contest in BrightonAbba arriving at London Airport I’m going to claim Cher as my idea, though Ol would probably also claim it as his.\u0026nbspI’ve always loved Cher\u0026nbspand had a conversation with her for the last movie before we cast Christine Baranski to see whether Cher would be interested in playing\u0026nbspTania then. She wasn’t, but she said to me recently it worked out well this way round.\u0026nbspI\u0026nbspalso felt that\u0026nbspif we were going to do a second film, well\u0026nbspwe had hit a high with Meryl on the first\u0026nbspand now we’d\u0026nbspgot to hit it out of the park. Who is one of the greatest actors who can sing? There’s Cher, there’s Bette\u0026nbspMidler and there’s Barbra Streisand. There was always going to be a mother character. Ol wrote the part\u0026nbspas the ultimate rock chick, and with Cher in mind. I was always fixated that Cher would be the perfect casting.Mamma Mia! has traditionally had great female roles that we lack in musical theatre and in movies and Cher really embraced it.\u0026nbspFor both films\u0026nbspwe cast brilliant actors. And\u0026nbspnow we\u0026nbsphave three generations, with Cher and Meryl Christine\u0026nbspBaranski\u0026nbspand Julie Walters\u0026nbspand Amanda Seyfried and the Lily James generation – and Cher gets the guy.“Fernando” was a favourite Abba song of hers and it was tempting for her to sing it.\u0026nbspI think with this film we could have a wink at the audience with how we use this old song, and it’s a brilliant moment when she and Andy Garcia (Fernando) discover each other again\u0026nbspand she tells that story through the power of her voice. You feel she was probably rebelling as a young woman in her early 20s, and then probably again when she was Donna Sheridan’s mum\u0026nbsphanging out at Studio 54 too much. And now we see her come back in her full glory as Ruby Sheridan – or as Cher, in fact.Saudi woman barred from marrying man ‘because he plays a instrument’Lily James on playing a young Meryl Streep, and singing Abba for AbbaAll the ABBA songs featured in Mamma Mia 2It was said that the last film\u0026nbspinvigorated people\u0026nbspand I think it probably did. We ran all summer, the summer of the financial crash, and it brought people of every age to the cinema. As a show we opened at the most tragic of all times in New York, the time of 911. You’ve got this massive show and one of the worst tragedies that you can imagine. How do you deal with that? With everyone involved\u0026nbspand the city in complete crisis, while people have\u0026nbspto keep going and\u0026nbspearn a living?It was a difficult time but the then-mayor, Rudy Giuliani, was incredibly galvanising to the Broadway community. People asked us:\u0026nbsp“Are you still going to open?” The answer had to be “yes”.\u0026nbspEveryone thought about it a lot and I know Phyllida sat and talked to the cast when we were rehearsing, it was almost like a therapy. But it was the best thing for everyone to make the show happen.I don’t think there will be a “Mamma Mia 3!”. It’s great that people are thinking that way I think people feel very safe with Mamma Mia! and this new movie has a lot more emotional heft, and it really makes you laugh and cry:\u0026nbspit’s a shared experience. And those songs, of course. They said, back when the show opened: “Oh people don’t always know those Abba songs.”\u0026nbspBut now “When I Kissed the Teacher”\u0026nbsp– the opening song on the movie – has\u0026nbspbeen\u0026nbsptrending on Spotify.Mamma Mia! was way before social media in the case of the stage show even the first\u0026nbspmovie came out before social media was the force it is now. Today, it’s a massive tool for marketing and communication, enabling us to\u0026nbspappeal to a younger audience. So it’s fascinating that I see on social media\u0026nbspa younger audience going:\u0026nbsp“Please do ‘Mamma Mia 3’.” That’s the natural thing for them.One person even said: “Why can’t it become the new Fast and Furious?”\u0026nbsp– that made me laugh a lot.Judy Craymer was talking to David Lister“MAMMA MIA!

Stepping into Julie Andrews’s formidable shoes, Blunt has promised to deliver a new take on the character – one that still pays tribute to Andrews’s\u0026nbspperformance, but draws more heavily from the version of Poppins we see in P.L. Travers’s source books. “She’s a little meaner,” Blunt teased.Lin-Manuel Miranda as Jack: The adult protégé of Burt (played by Dick Van Dyke in the 1964 original), is not a chimney sweep this time, but a “leerie” – a person who rides around on a bicycle\u0026nbspwith a ladder\u0026nbspto light the street lamps of London, then douses them in the morning.New Mary Poppins Returns trailer sees Emily Blunt singing and dancingJulie Andrews on why she won\u0027t appear in Mary Poppins ReturnsBen Whishaw as Michael: The grown-up version of Matthew Garber’s character from the 1964 film, Michael still lives in the same house on Cherry Tree Lane, and has followed in his father’s footsteps by working as a banker at the Fidelity Fiduciary Bank in London.

This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 716 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.816 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles.

Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Colin Firth as William Weatherall Wilkins: The new president of Fidelity Fiduciary Bank, previously overseen by Mr Dawes Sr (played by Dick Van Dyke in the 1964 film). He’ll be the film’s villain.Angela Lansbury as The Balloon Lady: Her character appeared in P L Travers’s original series of books.Meryl Streep as Topsy: As a nod to the “I Love to Laugh” sequence from the original, Streep has a cameo as the owner of a shop filled with trinkets. There’s one quirk: the first Monday of every month, her entire house turns upside down.Dick Van Dyke has made a return appearance, though not as Bert. He instead stars as Mr Dawes Jr, the son of Mr Dawes Sr – another character Van Dyke played in the 1964 film \u0026nbsp– and chairman of the Fidelity Fiduciary Bank.The original Mary Poppins won’t make an appearance in the sequel, as director Rob Marshall explained: “Julie was incredibly gracious, and we talked about it in a very general way but she made it clear right up front. She said, ‘This is Emily’s show, and I really want it to be Emily’s show. I don’t want it to be, \u0027Oh, here comes that Mary Poppins.\u0027 I don’t want that. I really want her to take this and run with it, because she will be brilliant.\u0027The film has Andrews’s full approval, however, as Marshall added: “She had known it was in the works, then we said, ‘We’re doing it,’ and she said, ‘Oh, thank god.’ Then we said, ‘And we’re thinking of Emily Blunt,’ and she just threw her hands up in the air and said yes. I think a lot of people feel that way about Emily’s work.The film, directed and produced by Rob Marshall, best known for Chicago and Into the Woods, brings the story forward to the era of the Great Depression, with a now grown-up Jane and Michael Banks living in their old house. After the death of Michael’s wife leaves him as a single father to three children, and throws their world into chaos, the Banks’s former nanny makes a return visit, with the help of lamplighter Jack.While 1964’s Mary Poppins draws mainly from the first book in P L Travers’s eight-part Mary Poppins series, the sequel focuses on an original story, which draws elements from several of the books.Mary Poppins Returns is an all-out musical, including new songs written by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, best known for the Broadway musicals Hairspray and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and an original score by Shaiman. There will also be dance numbers, including one which takes place on the streets of London, set to the new song “Trip a Little Light Fantastic”.The film features several sequences that, much like the original’s “Jolly Holiday” segment, place live actors into an animated world. One sequence will see Mary and the children e into a bathtub and arrive in an underwater world, while another has them jump into a Royal Doulton bowl.Mary Poppins Returns will be released in UK cinemas on 21 December.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

If they do entirely destroy them, they would take the information about them behind – but it is thought to be impossible for that information to simply disappear, leading to the paradox.Created with Sketch.The most incredible space images of Earth Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Explore ESA astronaut Tim Peake\u0027s stunning photos of Earth, taken from the International Space Station during his six month mission (captions by Tom Peake)Every day spent living in space is a great day, but today was particularly special.

No prizes for guessing where this is…From one mighty ocean to another – ships passing through the Panama canalBecause Professor Hawking suggested that black holes have a temperature and so would eventually cool down and evaporate, disappearing entirely from existence. With that, they appear to take the information with them, but it cannot simply be lost without breaking the laws of quantum mechanics.But the new paper suggests that can be explained by the phenomenon of soft hair. That is a sort of glossy edge\u0026nbspthat sits at the edge of the black hole and allows for scientists to overcome the paradox.Hawking memorial sees professor\u0027s voice shot into a black holeNow the researchers who worked with Professor Hawking on the paper in his final days will have to explore more of how exactly that works without him. They hope to find out how exactly the soft hair works, and what happens to it when the black hole comes to an end.The study itself – which is attributed to\u0026nbspSasha Haco, Stephen W. Hawking, Malcolm J. Perry and\u0026nbspAndrew Strominger –\u0026nbspdescribes that process in far more technical detail. The summary concludes with a sentence that reads: Assuming the existence of a quantum Hilbert space on which these charges generate the symmetries, as well as the applicability of the Cardy formula, the central charges reproduce the macroscopic area-entropy law for generic Kerr black holes.But at its most simple level it could be part of a solution to a problem that has occupied many of the greatest minds in the world for decades, according to researchers.“Understanding the microscopic origin of this entropy – what are the underlying quantum states that the entropy counts? – has been one of the great challenges of the last 40 years,\u0026nbspMarika Taylor, professor of theoretical physics at Southampton University and a former student of Hawking’s, told , which had first reported the new paper.This paper proposes a way to understand entropy for astrophysical black holes based on symmetries of the event horizon. The authors have to make several non-trivial assumptions so the next steps will be to show that these assumptions are valid.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But when they do so they will most likely see the library of the country they are in, as happens if Britons travel outside of the European Union now.“UK Netflix subscribers are able to access Netflix everywhere in the world Netflix is available and will continue to do so once the UK leaves the EU,” a Netflix spokesperson said. The company said that “local catalogues vary due to licensing and local tastes”, but pointed out its original shows are available everywhere.The new papers also make clear that the same regulations would apply to geo-blocking regulation. That ensures that people can buy from online services across the continent, without being punished for doing so from another country.“Following repeal of the Geo-Blocking Regulation in the UK, traders from the UK, EU and third countries would not be prohibited from discriminating between EU customers and UK customers,” the papers say.“For instance a UK trader would be able to offer different terms to a UK customer compared to a French customer.”Companies based in the UK and selling products and services in the EU\u0026nbspwill still have to comply with the regulation, to ensure that they don’t discriminate between people in different countries within Europe.The new geo-blocking rules go into effect in December 2018, meaning that they will apply to UK citizens for about\u0026nbspthree months before a possible no-deal Brexit in March 2019.The paper covering ‘Geo-blocking of online content if there’s no Brexit deal’ and another covering portability of content\u0026nbspis one of a range of papers released in the latest set of documents from the UK government. They also include new documents showing Britain could no longer benefit from deals that represent a significant portion of UK trade and that train journeys into and out of the EU could be disrupted.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But the warning says that if this does not happen, horses could not be taken into the bloc.EU certification would require more work by vets to confirm the absence of disease, the paper notes, which could cost up to £500 more if blood tests are needed, depending which category the UK was placed in.Created with Sketch.Tories at war: Boris Johnson \u0027suicide vest\u0027 Brexit jibe causes ide Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Internal isions in the Conservative Party have exploded into a bitter public row over Boris Johnson‘s “disgusting” criticism of Theresa May.Sajid Javid, the home secretary, rebuked his former cabinet colleague and said: “I think there are much better ways to articulate your differences.”But other MPs leapt to Mr Johnson’s defence, as iding lines ahead of a possible leadership contest begin to take shape.

The goods will therefore need to be checked as they enter the UK,” they say.The Food Standards Agency plans to require all importers of high-risk food and feed from the EU to warn them using a new UK import notification system.All the new guidance documents have the caveat: “This notice is meant for guidance only. You should consider whether you need separate professional advice before making specific preparations.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

condemned the “shambolic” prospect of a no-deal exit – warning of higher shop prices and a huge loss of jobs, if tariffs were imposed.And the British Chamber of Commerce said it underlined the need for the UK and EU to break the deadlock “as soon as possible, to avoid the confusion and significant disruption of a no deal scenario”.The UK boasts around 40 free trade agreements, with more than 70 countries, because it is an EU member, including the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Turkey and NorwayThey give businesses “a range of preferential market access opportunities”, including cheaper import tariffs and duties and more relaxed “rules of origin” requirements.The deals also provide “enhanced market access” for services, “public procurement opportunities” and “improved protections for

Then, online sleuths reportedly managed to use open-source material to identify at least eight of those allegedly involved in the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a 59-year-old Saudi journalist, as members of Saudi security forces. One photo purported to show a member of the 15-member team hobnobbing with Mohammed bin Salman, the powerful 33-year-old Saudi crown prince who has become the primary target of\u0026nbspMr Khashoggi’s criticisms. Another identified an alleged team member as Salah Mohammed al-Tubaigy, a name and face matching the head of forensic evidence at Saudi’s General Security department.Sabah purports to identify the 15-member Saudi team allegedly involved in the disappearance of journalist Jamal KhashoggiThe details\u0026nbspwere published by Sabah, a mass-circulation daily newspaper close to the government of president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Friends, family, and officials say Mr Khashoggi was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October before disappearing.\u0026nbspTurkish media reported that security camera footage from inside the consulate was removed and that staff were ordered to go home the afternoon Mr Khashoggi arrived.On the same day, two private jets, owned by Riyadh based Sky Prime Aviation,\u0026nbspreportedly arrived from Saudi Arabia to Istanbul’s Ataturk airport, carrying the 15 personnel, landing just hours before Mr Khashoggi’s scheduled appointment at the consulate. Some of the 15 checked in to the five-star\u0026nbspMovenpick\u0026nbsphotel near the Saudi consulate in Istanbul’s Levent district.\u0026nbspBoth private jets and the 15 men departed hours later, according to Turkish officials and local press. Khashoggi: Emergence of Saudi dissident and his potentially tragic endTurkish authorities investigating the disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi with Turkish ethnic roots, have been leaking information about the probe to local and international media with what appears to be the tacit approval of government officials.Police in Istanbul have formed a special team to investigate Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, the newspaper Milliyet reported, tasked specifically to use chemicals, dogs, and infrared light to look for DNA, blood and other traces of the journalist at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.The Post and other media also circulated a photo, likely taken from security camera footage, showing a black Mercedes Vito van that was parked outside the consulate and left shortly after Mr Khashoggi’s arrival, parked in front of the residence of Saudi consul general Mohammad al-Otaibi.The 15-member team identified by Sabah are all Saudi men aged between 30 and 57 years old. Those purportedly tracked down via open source internet tools by Oslo-based researcher Iyad al-Baghdadi and others include: a Saudi special forces member a lieutenant colonel in the Saudi civil defence force a major and lieutenant in the Saudi air force a lieutenant in the service guarding the crown prince’s palace and an intelligence service colonel who had once been attached to the Saudi embassy in the UK.Kalin on the disappearance of a Saudi journalist Jamal KhashoggiMr Khashoggi served for years as the right-hand man of Saudi prince Turki bin Faisal, a former intelligence chief as well as Riyadh’s envoy to the US and UK.\u0026nbspIncreasingly frustrated with Saudi Arabia’s\u0026nbspcourse, he began to bristle at the restrictions placed on media and civil society, eventually moving to the US last year amid fears for his own safety. In recent months he had grown increasingly critical of the crown prince, who has been criticised as authoritarian despite attempts to cast himself as a reformer. Saudi officials have denied that they had anything to do with Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, insisting he left the consulate, but without providing proof, as demanded by Mr Erdogan.\u0026nbspThe disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a permanent US resident, has put Washington in a tough spot. The crown prince has forged a strong alliance with the administration\u0026nbspof Donald Trump and a personal bond with the US president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. US lawmakers have made tough statements about the Khashoggi affair, but the White House and State Department have been tepid. Saudi Arabia has vowed to buy $110bn in American weapons.“We’re not going to make any judgments about what had happened to him,” Heather Nauert, State Department spokeswoman, told reporters on Tuesday. “The United States is certainly concerned about his whereabouts. Senior officials at the State Department have spoken with Saudi officials through diplomatic channels about the matter.

All appear in excellent health and are settling in well.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThis is the culmination of a two-year project and the beginning of an exciting new era. We hope these animals will act as conservation ambassadors for the species, and promote conservation and education about Australian marsupials.Although the new arrivals, four females and one male, are settling in well at their bespoke enclosure called Koala Creek, with its natural stream and eucalyptuses, it will be another six months before they make their public debut. The koalas are sharing their home with the two southern hairy-nosed wombats, their nearest living relatives.Medical checks have declared the animals fit and well after leaving the Cleland Wildlife Park near Adelaide on a Singapore Airlines cargo flight, having earlier bid farewell to their keepers.Koalas settling in at their new Longleat enclosure (Image: Longleat)Longleat custodian Lord Weymouth has become the patron of the IKCE which is based in Cleland and is raising funds to help koala conservation.Cleland Director Chris Daniels said: \u0026ldquoWe have been working closely with the team at Longleat to ensure the koalas and wombats receive the very best care and attention when they settle in.\u0026ldquoThe new facility is fantastic and has been specifically designed with these animals in mind. Their arrival in the UK is a very exciting moment and will undoubtedly help raise awareness of these unique animals.Longleat is one of only two locations in the UK, and the only one in Europe to keep the southern variety.

That would not be leaving the EU.Dominic Raab said he would never agree to a Brexit deal which \u0027traps\u0027 the UK in a customs union (Image: EPA)8.20pm: There is no such thing as a \u0026lsquoBrexit bonus\u0026rsquo - George Osborne dismisses successor\u0027s claimsFormer chancellor George Osborne has rubbished the idea of a \u0026ldquoBrexit bonus for the UK economy on the same day his successor claimed Britain would see a \u0026ldquodeal idend by striking good terms with Brussels.Mr Osborne\u0026nbspsaid no one credible believes leaving the European Union will benefit the economy.His comment comes as his replacement, Chancellor Philip Hammond, said Britain will see an \u0026ldquoupside idend in terms of the economy if the UK secures a good Brexit deal from the EU.Mr Osborne,\u0026nbspnow the editor of the London Evening Standard,\u0026nbsptold Channel 4 News: I certainly don\u0027t think... there is some kind of Brexit bonus which you get some people talking about because every international observer of the British economy, the domestic observers of the British economy, including the Office for Budget Responsibility which I created, have all made the observation that depending on the kind of Brexit deal the country will either be very much less well off or just a little bit less well off than it would otherwise have been depending on the exact nature of the Brexit and the relationship with the EU going forward.He added: The idea that Britain is better off for leaving the EU I just don\u0027t believe it, nor does anyone... almost no one credible believes that. So there\u0027s the question of how much worse off are we than we would otherwise have been and that\u0027s all up for debate and all dependent partly on the outcome of these Brexit negotiations.Former Chancellor George Osborne has rubbished claims of a \u0027Brexit bonus\u0027 for the UK economy (Image: Dave BenettGetty Images)7.30pm: Good deal will create Brexit \u0026lsquoDIVIDEND\u0026rsquo, Chancellor saysBritain will see a Brexit deal idend if good orce terms are agreed with Brussels, Philip Hammond has said.The Chancellor told the BBC that the last 10 days had seen a measurable change in pace in Brexit negotiations, although many challenges remain ahead of a prospective deal.Mr Hammond is due to present a crunch Budget - the last currently due before the UK quits the EU next March - at the end of October.The idea of a Brexit idend has previously been floated by Theresa May who suggested it as a way to part-fund a \u0026pound20.5 billion-a-year boost to the NHS.But its validity has been questioned, including from within the Conservative Party.Mr Hammond, speaking to reporters at the International Monetary Fund\u0027s annual meeting in Bali, told the Financial Times: If we are successful in negotiating that package, there will be an upside idend in terms of the economy and, consequently, the fiscal numbers, so that\u0027s the first bonus.The second bonus is that I\u0027ve been holding a slightly larger fiscal buffer than would otherwise be necessary because of the degree of uncertainty that exists at the moment.As that uncertainty is unwound and we\u0027re in more favourable circumstances, logically, one would need less of a fiscal buffer and some of that could be released to support the spending envelope or to deliver tax cuts.The Chancellor said good Brexit terms would provide the UK coffers with a \u0027deal idend\u0027 (Image: PA)5.40pm: British horse racing \u0026lsquoto continue as normal\u0026rsquo in no-deal BrexitHorse racing should be unaffected by a no-deal Brexit, according to the Government\u0026rsquos latest technical notices.Concerns had been raised about horse racing and participation in classics like the Derby and the Grand National because many participants come from Ireland and France.But the guidance issued by Whitehall made it clear that British races will not be affected because there will be no bar on horses entering the UK.However, EU races like the Arc de Triomphe in Paris may be more difficult for British based horses.The document said: We are seeking discussions with the European Commission to allow the UK to become a listed third country on the day we leave the EU.However, to allow effective contingency planning, in the event that the UK is not a listed country equine movement to the EU could not take place.We are confident, however, that the UK meets the animal health requirements to secure\u0026nbsplisting, as other countries such as Australia and New Zealand have done.Horse racing in the UK would be unaffected by a no-deal Brexit, Government papers suggest (Image:  IMAGES)4.30pm: We are NOT holding Theresa May to ransom - DUPArlene Foster has denied claims her party is holding the British Government to ransom over Brexit.In an attempt to break the impasse over the Irish border issue, Theresa May has suggested a temporary customs arrangement between the EU and the UK as a whole.The proposal includes the expectation that a permanent future deal would be in place by the end of 2021.But Mrs May\u0026rsquos allies in the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) have threatened consequences if the Government does anything which could undermine the constitutional integrity of the UK.Mrs Foster has said the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos plans would effectively create a border down the Irish Sea as goods moving between Northern Ireland and the UK would require customs and VAT checks.But Mrs May is reliant on votes from the 10 DUP MPs in the Commons to maintain a majority over opposition parties.Asked this afternoon whether her party is holding the British Government to ransom, Mrs Foster replied: \u0026ldquoNo, not at all.DUP leader Arlene Foster denied her party was holding Mrs May\u0027s Government to ransom (Image: PA)3.10pm: Brussels must match UK\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquoambition and pragmatism\u0026rsquo or Britain will leave without a deal - Brexit SecretaryDominic Raab said the latest no deal technical notices published today shows how seriously the Government is taking the prospect of leaving the EU without an agreement in place.The Brexit Secretary said securing a good deal is still the goal but he warned the UK would exit the bloc without one if Brussels fails to match Britain\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoambition and pragmatism.He said: We have now published over 100 technical notices, giving iniduals, businesses, public bodies and NGOs (non-governmental organisations) information and guidance in the unlikely event of no deal.Securing a good deal with our EU partners remains our top priority. But, if the EU doesn\u0027t match the ambition and pragmatism we\u0027ve shown, we have the plans in place to avoid, mitigate or manage the risk of no deal - and make a success of Brexit.

And I think we will find it, he told Le Monde newspaper in an interview.The Irish issue is obviously extra difficult. It\u0027s true we are not where we should be to strike a deal.He added: In any case, if Ireland finds itself in a situation where it can\u0027t accept the solutions put forward, we won\u0027t conclude: \u0027Ireland First\u0027.Andrea Jenkyns has said the 48 letters must go in (Image: )1.13pm update: \u0027No permanent backstop,\u0027 insists Downing Street.Downing Street has insisted Prime Minister Theresa May would never submit to a deal locking the UK into a customs union indefinitely after intense speculation and consequent rumours about ministers being ready to quit over the issue.Mrs May is under intense pressure as she tries to seal a withdrawal agreement with time running out before the UK quits the bloc next year.Her so-called Chequers blueprint is not popular with Brexiteers within her party and fears that she could be proposing more compromises to Brussels surfaced after a meeting with senior cabinet ministers yesterday.Of particular concern was the suggestion that the UK could stay in a customs union tying it to the EU\u0026rsquos rules and regulations after 2020 in the event that a Brexit deal can be struck.Downing Street today insisted: \u0026ldquoThe Prime Minister would never agree to a deal which would trap the UK in a backstop permanently.11.35 update: \u0026ldquoWe need a new leader, says Tory MP JenkynsEUROSCEPTIC backbench Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns has said her party \u0026ldquowill need a new leader if Prime Minister Theresa May does not rule out the possibility of the UK remaining in a customs union after Brexit.Ms Jenkyns, who ousted Ed Balls in the last general election to be elected member for Morley and Outwood, was reacting to rumours of further compromises to Brussels following Mrs May\u0026rsquos meeting with senior cabinet ministers yesterday.The 44-year-old, a supporter of the pro-Brexit group Leave Means Leave, tweeted: If the PM and Gov continue to push for the UK to remain in the Customs Union \u0027partnership\u0027, then we need a new leader.\u0026ldquoThe 48 letters must go in.\u0026ldquoThis is an ultimate betrayal of the 17.4 million people who voted to leave. #ChuckChequersFrench and British fishing boats ram one another in the English Channel (Image: Reuters) (Image: Reuters)11.20am update: Scallop wars could erupt again after Brexit, industry leaders warn GovernmentClashes between British and militant French fishermen could flare up again after Brexit, the Government has been warned by industry leaders pressing for a fair deal.In August, rocks and smoke bombs were launched by more than 30 French vessels in a skirmish with a handful of British boats off the coast of Normandy.The so-called scallop wars were over access to stocks in the Baie de Seine grounds.National regulations let British ships fish there legally all year round, but French fishermen are banned from taking the molluscs between May 15 and October 1, to conserve stocks.An Anglo-French truce was agreed but UK fishermen\u0027s leaders say the issue is not sorted for good.Barrie Deas, chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen\u0027s Organisations, said: Normandy has always demonstrated that kind of militant behaviour and he did not expect it to change.Brexit optimism is fuelling the rise of the pound, say financial analysts (Image: )11.07 update: Analysts predict more gains for sterling as deal optimism growsFINANCIAL analysts are predicting gains for the pound for a second consecutive week on the back of burgeoning optimism about the prospects of a Brexit deal at next week\u0026rsquos European Union Summit.Underscoring the British pound\u0027s gains has been favourable comments from EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier earlier this week that an agreement with Britain could be within reach next week.Negotiators from both sides have been locked in talks this week to overcome differences on the biggest outstanding hurdle to a deal \u0026ndash how to keep the UK frontier with the Irish republic free of border checks after Britain leaves the EU in March.ING strategists advised caution on adding long bets on the British currency around current levels, because domestic politics might prove to be a major headwind.The British currency slipped 0.2 percent lower but is down 0.4 percent from the day\u0027s highs at $1.3207. Against the euro, it was broadly steady at 87.60 pence.While long positions in sterling has increased in the last two weeks, overall bets remain near their lowest since May 2017, according to latest positioning data.Gordon Brown has said he is convinced there will be a second referendum (Image: )10.49am update: Brown predicts second referendumFormer\u0026nbspprime minister Gordon Brown has predicted a future referendum on\u0026nbspBrexit.Speaking in Edinburgh, he said: I\u0027m pretty convinced there will be a referendum sometime.It will, in the end, be the only way to sort out the problem.He added: The people, even though they don\u0027t like the idea of a isive referendum, will eventually demand a final say.Damien Green has tried to defuse a row between the Tories and the DUP (Image: )10.17am update: Theresa May is a very unionist PM, says Damien Green in bid to defuse DUP rowTheresa May is a very unionist Prime Minister one of her Conservative allies has insisted amid a Brexit row between her Government and the Democratic Unionist Party.Her former deputy Damian Green said that she and the DUP which supports her administration were as one in their desire to see Northern Ireland treated like the rest of the UK.It comes after the party, which has a confidence and supply deal to back the Tories in Westminster, warned that it would not accept any scenario which involves a border down the Irish Sea, threatening to vote against the upcoming Budget.Mr Green told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today: She is a very unionist PM, we are the Conservative and Unionist Party.She and the DUP are as one in wanting to make sure than Northern Ireland isn\u0027t in some way treated differently from the rest of the United Kingdom in trade or customs terms and that is an absolutely key point in these negotiations, as the DUP have pointed out.His remarks come after the DUP\u0026rsquos Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson yesterday warned of \u0026ldquoconsequences if the Conservative Party did not honour its \u0026ldquoobligations towards his party.He said: \u0026ldquoWe have simply spelt out what some of those consequences would be.\u0026ldquoI hope the Prime Minister will not go down the route, which has been suggested. She is being forced by the EU.The M26 will be closed until Monday (Image: PA)10.03am update: M26 in Kent to be closed to prepare for no-deal lorry parkTHE M26 will be closed until next week to prepare to turn it into a potential lorry park in the event there is a no-deal Brexit.The Kent motorway closure infuriated the local Tory MP Tom Tugendhat who said he had not been told.He fumed at the Transport Secretary Chris Grayling for keeping him in the dark.The MP for Tunbridge and Malling said in the Commons on Thursday: \u0026ldquoIt comes to a pretty pass when an MP is told that work is going on to turn part of a motorway into a lorry park.Without any consultation with the local community or surrounding members.Chancellor Philip Hammond says the backstop plan must be temporary (Image: )9am update: \u0027Backstop must be temporary,\u0027 says HammondChancellor Philip Hammond has insisted any backstop solution for Northern Ireland must be temporary as the tension mounts after Prime Minister Theresa May\u0027s meeting with senior ministers yesterday.During an interview on Bloomberg TV, Mr Hammond also said the UK may require a fiscal buffer to get it through a rocky period after it quits the EU next year.Mr Hammond acknowledged the backstop plan to avoid a hard border with the Irish Republic would probably be needed after the end of the transition period in December 2020, assuming a withdrawal agreement with the EU can be reached \u0026ndash but stressed this would need to be a temporary arrangement.He said: We\u0027re not going to remain in anything indefinitely.We\u0027re very clear this has to be a temporary period, but it is true that there needs to be a period \u0026ndash probably following the transition period that we\u0027ve negotiated and before we enter into our long-term partnership \u0026ndash just because of the time it will take to implement the systems required.In a separate interview for the BBC at an IMF meeting in Bali, he voiced optimism about striking a deal with the EU before March 29, 2019 \u0026ndash the date the UK quits the bloc.He said: What has happened over the last week, ten days, is that there has been a measurable change in pace.\u0026ldquoThe European Commission is now clearly engaged, there is a sense of urgency and a sense of both sides really trying to break through and solve these knotty problems.\u0026nbspBut that shouldn\u0027t conceal the fact that we still have some big differences left to resolve.So process is a lot more positive this week \u0026ndash substance still very challenging.Mr Hammond also played down hopes the unofficial deadline set at the beginning of the negotiations at October 31 will be met.But he said, as the official day of the UK withdrawal approaches, the pace of the talks has been stepped up.Hillary Clinton delivers her speech at Queen\u0027s University (Image: )8.03am update: Brexit a self-inflicted wound, claims Hillary ClintonDefeated 2016 US Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has claimed Brexit \u0026ldquomay well go down as one of the greatest and most unnecessary self-inflicted wounds in modern history during a visit to Belfast.And she said it was crucial arrangements for the Irish border did not undermine \u0026ldquopeace and prosperity in Northern Ireland.Mrs Clinton made her remarks during a visit to Queen\u0026rsquos University, where she collected an honorary degree for her \u0026ldquoconsiderable contribution to the Northern Ireland peace process.She told guests: \u0026ldquoI make no excuse for being against Brexit from the start, explaining she had \u0026ldquothought it was a bad idea before the referendum, and I think it is an even worse idea now.She added: \u0026ldquoBrexit seems to be going ahead one way or the other.\u0026ldquoIt is crucial that however it comes out, Brexit should not be allowed to undermine the peace and prosperity that has been so dearly won here.

By comparison, Luxembourg has 39, and Paris 24, with Germany cities Frankfurt, Munich and Berlin drawing a combined total of 29.Companies opting for Dublin include JP Morgan, Barlcays, Morgan Stanley, Equilend, Beazley, Royal London Group, Odgers Berndtson and DLA Piper.

agree to staying in the EU\u0026rsquos customs union for a period without a time limit.The proposal had been mooted as a solution to the so-called Northern Ireland backstop to resolve the problem around the land border with Ireland.But after Mrs May failed to persuade senior members of her cabinet on the solution while others including Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab have made it clear they would resign, Mrs May has ditched the suggestion.There are also serious questions whether Mrs May could get the proposal through parliament with the powerful European Research Group of Tory Brexiteer

The British people voted to take back control over money, laws borders and trade.It is understood that a number of ministers voiced concern at a meeting with the PM in Downing Street on Thursday that any such backstop could leave the UK in an open-ended customs union, preventing it from seeking trade deals elsewhere in the world.Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has said it risks making the UK a permanent EU colony.Meanwhile, Chancellor Philip Hammond became the first senior Government figure to suggest that the backstop - designed to keep the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic open in the case that no broader EUUK trade deal is finalised - will probably have to come into effect for a period.But the Democratic Unionist Party, which props up Mrs May\u0027s minority Conservative administration in the House of Commons, urged her to resist any initiatives from Brussels which might threaten the Union.DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said there would be consequences for Mrs May if she walked away from her promise to protect the Union.We are simply reminding her, you are being torn at the moment between what we believe are your gut instincts and your sound principles on the Union and at the same time the bullying, threatening behaviour of the EU, said Mr Wilson at a meeting of DUP MPs and Assembly members in Portadown.Go with your principles, go with your instinct, go with your responsibility to the people of the UK and show the EU negotiators the door.BREXIT negotiations: Theresa May and European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker (Image: EMMANUEL DUNANDAFPGetty Images)Mrs May chaired a meeting of the inner Cabinet on Brexit progress Mrs May set out in June proposals for a temporary customs arrangement to ensure that the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic remains open in the case that no broader EUUK trade agreement has been finalised.The document stated that the UK Government expects this arrangement to remain in place no later than the end of December 2021.But the EU is mounting resistance to any specific time limit being included in the text of the UK\u0027s Withdrawal Agreement, while Leave-backing ministers are understood to be insistent that the end of the arrangement should be more precisely defined than the vague term temporary.Earlier, Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey, who was not at the Downing Street meeting, pointedly refused to endorse the Prime Minister\u0027s Chequers blueprint for Brexit.International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt and the Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom -

But this is the reality of trying to save up for a house.They work hard each month. They’d love to put something aside to save up for a home.But to live where there are good jobs, they have to spend so much on high rents that there’s nothing left over.So they can never save enough to break out of the cycle. No wonder they are frustrated.New figures show how bad things have got. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says four out of ten people in the  to -year-old age bracket couldn’t afford the mortgage on even the cheapest house in their area, eventhey had a deposit.The gap between prices and normal people’s earnings is just too big, because since  house prices in Britain have gone up more than in any other developed country.Expensive housing has meant that the proportion of young people on middle incomes who own their own home has collapsed: down from nearly two thirds  years ago, to just over a quarter today.We have to turn this round and restore home ownership.Many people feel they can’t get on and start a family until they have a nest of their own. Their lives are on hold.Politically it’s vital too. If young people don’t feel they’ve got a chance to get on in le, they are more likely to gamble and vote for extreme, disastrous politicians like Jeremy Corbyn.Even younger people who are earning decent wages feel squeezed, because they face a combination of high house prices and chunky repayments on their student loans.The Prime Minister is acutely aware of this. That’s why she’s set up a review of student fees, and moved to make housing her Number  priority other than Brexit.Hence her announcement of massive funding to build more affordable housing for people on lower incomes. But there’s much more to do.Building more homes for people to buy is a big part of the answer. Since  we have built only half as many houses as France each year, and so house prices have gone up twice as fast.Some people say building more means we must tear up the planning system and concrete over the countryside.But we know that approach won’t work. When Gordon Brown was PM we tried setting each area massive housing targets. All those targets built was resentment. We need a smarter approach to tackle the reasons people often oppose new housing.We build in the wrong places. Instead of tacking on new estates to existing towns and villages without enough new school places or parking places, let’s get back into the business of building planned new cities and towns.Let’s build upwards in our city centres with taller buildings, rather than just sprawling cities outwards.What drives people mad is seeing developers make massive windfall profits when they get planning permission, but then not sharing those benefits with local residents.Imagine instead,new houses being built next door always paid for people in neighbouring streets to get cheap homes for their children to buy. People would feel much better about development.Restoring the dream of home ownership isn’t just about building more houses though.We need to think about the balance of rented properties and home ownership. Over the last ten years we’ve built many new homes each year, but the number of homeowners fell. How come The reason is that the number of properties being snapped up by buy-to-let landlords has grown faster than we have built new ones.Don’t get me wrong. Landlords, who have themselves worked hard, weren’t doing anything wrong.Butwe want to get home ownership growing again we need to encourage savers to put their money into shares and into growing businesses rather than just bidding up the price of houses. The think tank Onward proposed this week that we should offer a tax break to landlords who sell their homes to their tenants.This “Chance to Buy” would be a bit like the Right to Buy Margaret Thatcher introduced for council tenants. It could be paid for by tax changes which would discourage people from buying up new buy-to-let properties.So fewer landlords, more homeowners.Young people just want the same chances previous generations enjoyed. So let’s build more by building smarter, and give a new generation the chance to buy a home.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sun Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He murdered PC Keith Palmer.And now the thing that beggars belief. At that very moment, the acting commissioner of the politan Police, Craig Mackey, was leaving the scene in a car.

We had no protective equipment.“The way the male came in, he was clearly a threat.“The attacker had one of those looks where,they get you in that look, they would be after you.”So he skedaddled as fast as he could, actually driving right past Masood.It has a Monty Python ring to it.“When danger reared its ugly head, Sir Craig bravely turned and fled . . .”How, I wondered, could he possibly do that  I thought one of the requirements for being a copper was a certain bravery and, you know, a vague interest in apprehending criminals Also, Masood seemed a bit nasty. He had “one of those looks”.No s**t, Sherlock.

That’s what the lefties wanted at the time.They bleated that stop-and-search was racist. Craig was only too happy to oblige. Oh, the irony of it.It’s thought ending stop-and-search contributed to the jamboree of stabbings we have seen in London this year.You wonder how Mackey has lived with himself these last  months. And how he can possibly retain the respect of his less well-remunerated colleagues.But it tells you a lot about the way our police forces are run these days.Their political grandstanding on “hate-speech” issues.Their reluctance to engage in the dficult, nasty side of policing, such as stopping real villains going about their work.Resign, Sir Craig.At least salvage a little bit of dignity by doing that.She turns them all down because they were too small.

The moron hordes descended upon Kelly, pictured.They demanded he “educate himself”, saying Churchill was a racist, imperialist murderer. The usual rot.Kelly was forced to apologise, though he should never have done so. Sure, Churchill possessed a few views which today we would find a little, er, problematic.

equivalent to a little under what would normally fall in an entire week.Pembrey Sands in South Wales saw a total of mm over  hours while Scolton Country Park in Pembrokeshire was not far behind with .mm.Wales usually sees an average rainfall in October of .mm and a monthly average of .mm.The wet weather is set to come on the tail-end of Tropical Storm Leslie — which is currently helping sweep up warm air from the Canary Islands to Britain.Despite the storms, temperatures have been much higher for this time of year than usually expected during Autumn.The last time temperatures exceeded C at this time of year was in October  when a staggering .C was clocked."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000429099319.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"m26 motorway closed brexit lorry park","story":"Ministers last night snuck out plans to shut down the M in Kent so builders can work on the road.It will be redeveloped to enable it to hold lorries on part or all of the roada No Deal Brexit leads to huge queues at the port of Dover.MPs responded with fury to the news which was slipped out without any explanation.The M, which connects the M around London to the M running towards Dover, was closed at pm last night and reopened at .am.The closures will continue until Monday -

The disastrous welfare shake-up is set to clobber millions of hard-up families. Writing for the Mirror, Labour’s most powerful elected politician, London’s mayor Sadiq Khan, called UC “flawed, cruel and harmful”. The leader of Britain’s biggest trade union also backed the Mirror’s Stop the Universal Credit Cruelty campaign. Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: “We need an urgent conversation about how work is made to pay so people can live in dignity... not punished by the Department for Work and Pensions and pressed into pauperism.  “We need fair welfare to support people, especially the vulnerable, through times of need. “Every right-thinking person in the country should now unite behind the Mirror’s campaign to stop this car crash of a benefit. Scrap universal credit now.” Officials representing some of the poorest in society have also piled pressure on ministers by urging them to think again before the overhaul takes effect nationwide in July. UC is already in operation in parts of Britain. UC rolls six welfare benefits – child tax credit working tax credit jobseeker’s allowance income support employment and support allowance and housing benefit – into a single, monthly payment.  It will be in every Jobcentre for new claimants by December. Around . million existing benefit claimants are due to be “migrated” to UC from July. Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey has defended the scheme but admitted some families will lose out. She said: “We made tough decisions some people will be worse off.” Theresa May’s former deputy Damian Green, who is still close to the PM, said: “The whole point of universal credit is that extra work always pays.” Though he admitted the system will need “tweaking”.

More than , people had signed our petition by last night. Vicki Nash, of mental health charity Mind, said: “Already, far too many people are losing out because they can’t navigate the online system for universal credit or fill out complex and y forms when they’re unwell.” Citizens Advice called for urgent improvements to UC.

Critics claimed the punishment was “manestly excessive”. Yesterday the Daily Mirror revealed the Altham family business, J.C. Altham and Sons, supplies the Irish Sea oil and gas industry. Now Blackpool South MP Gordon Marsden, whose seat is near the Cuadrilla site where the men were arrested, has asked for clarication from the Ministry of Justice. In formal questions in Parliament, he asked Justice Secretary David Gaukehe will undertake an investigation into compliance with the Judicial Code of Conduct relating to the case. He also asked Mr Gauke to make public whether the judge sought advice from his Department and the Ministry of Justice on the requirements of the Judicial Code of Conduct in relation to family connections.  Mr Marsden said in a tweet that the judge should have excused [sic] himself. The MP told the Mirror: I think it is in the public interest that we should know as soon as possible whether the judicial code of conduct was adhered to by the judge in question at this trial. The controversy regarding the severity of sentencing makes this particularly important in such a highly sensitive and charged situation as fracking.

The judge’s parents John and Linda,  and , are shydirectors of J.C. Altham  Sons.

It urged Lancashire County Council to permit fracking and create a “poundbillion supply chain”. Judges are expected to tell defence and shyprosecution lawyersthey feel their impartiality in a case may be called into question.  A spokesman for the Judges’ Council said: “There are longstanding principles, set out in case law, which guide how judges approach possible conflicts of interest. They ensure that when hearing a case, a judge will be mindful of possible conflicts of interest and can draw relevant matters to the attention of parties in the case.” Judge Altham did not wish to add anything to the Judges’ Council’s statement when the Mirror first reported the story.

Campaigners have said some families could end up pound a month worse off. In its place we want a modern welfare state, helping instead of hurting children .  It comes after former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has described it as a “cruel and shyvindictive” system, warning it will plunge a record five million children below the breadline. Writing in the Mirror Mr Brown said that after  years in politics, he never expected to see poverty and hardship ing on such a terrible scale. His is the most prominent voice to join calls for the system to be scrapped. The Mirror revealed two weeks ago Labour was considering axing the benefit reforms.  Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said on Sunday: “I think we are moving to a position now where it is just not sustainable. It will have to go.” Universal Credit introduced one system to replace six benefits: Child Tax Credit, Working Tax Credit, Jobseekers Allowance, Income Support, Employment Support Allowance and Housing Benefit. When former Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith launched it in  he said that it would make work pay.  But the major problem was that it coincided with billions in Tory benefit cuts making it less generous than its design. Three quarters of claimants struggle with bills - according to the DWPs own figures.  Rent arrears soared pound a head in two trial zones, while food bank use in another area, Hastings, rose %. There have also been concerns raised by charities that paying the money to the head of the household fans the flames of domestic abuse.  While just last week the Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey is said to have admitted privately that millions of families will lose pound a month. In June the National Audit Office warned there is no evidence UC is making work pay and it may never be value for money.  Last year , people failed to get their first payment within a six-week limit. Ministers unveiled pound.bn of improvements in November , cutting the six-week wait to five, but critics say it was not enough. While even Mr Duncan Smith called for another poundbillion to be pumped in. After eight delays UC will only finish its rollout in March .

She hopes this will help the youngsters remember her when she is not around any more. Kaylea complained of stomach pains for years - but says doctors told her it was nothing to worry about.In January , she was diagnosed with stage  bowel cancer which had spread to her liver, the Liverpool Echo reported.At the time, her two children were just three and nine months old.  The mum underwent sessions of chemotherapy every fortnight for three months in hope of reducing the tumours - but this was unsuccessful. After having an operation to remove part of her bowel and half of her liver, the teaching assistant thought she had beaten the cancer and was getting stronger each day. Her sister, Sinead Callacher said: At the time, Kaylea’s two beautul babies, Kian and Aoe were just three years old and nine months old. This news, as you can imagine, was very hard to digest. However, Kaylea being the strongest person I know, put up a fight for her family. However, Kaylea started experiencing pain and sickness earlier this month and was admitted to Merseysides Aintree Hospital again on Tuesday. Doctors carried out scans on Wednesday, which revealed that the cancer has ed and is now terminal.  Sinead added: Bringing her scan forward, we heard the news we hoped we would never hear. Kaylea’s cancer is back and this time has spread all over her liver, meaning another operation is out of the question. [We are] now being told there is nothing they can do and she may not make it to see Christmas. Doctors have predicted that Kaylea does not have long left to live, and have advised her to celebrate Christmas next month, which she is hoping to do with her family in a cottage. Kaylea, who is engaged to her partner of  years, Mark McCole, has also announced her final wish is to marry him before she dies. Kaylea thought this wasnt going to be possible, but she has today been announced as the winner of the Liverpool Echos Win a Wedding competition.  It was revealed that Kaylea was a clear winner, after more than one million tokens were submitted in her name by people of Liverpool who were moved by her story. Upon hearing she was the winner of the wedding worth pound,, Kaylea said: We met in the Yates bar in Bootle when we were just , and I just cant explain what this means to us. We have wanted to marry for so long and then we had kids, and then this news. Its amazing - it means the world to us both. The doctors told me to do what I wanted to do, and I will now be able to do both - spend Christmas with my family and marry Mark. The particularly touching reason Kaylea wanted to get married before she passed away, however, was so that she would have the same surname as her children.  She explained: One of the big things is I want my children to have the same surname as me. I want them to realise I was part of their le, even when Im not around anymore. Although there is no cure for the cancer, Kayleas family have launched a fundraising page in an attempt to raise pound, for treatment. Sinead, , set up the page and claims without it my sister might not make it until Christmas. She added: The specialists have gave us one chance but its not through the NHS and its pound, per round. We cant give up on my sister, please I need all your help. The drug, from America, is called Avastin and is used alongside chemotherapy in an attempt to prevent existing tumors growing further.  While the treatment will not cure Kaylea, Sinead hopes it will extend her le by a few more months to give her time with her children.

And as the bride prepared to walk down the aisle this morning, one royal couldnt help making a comparison between the two weddings. Sitting inside St Georges Chapel at Windsor Castle, Zara Tindall was seen leaning back to say a few words to Harry about his own nuptials.

In response, he asked: Mine   Meghan, , who leaned forward as Zara spoke, donned a navy dress and coat by Givenchy for this mornings ceremony in Berkshire. In May, she had worn a wedding gown by the same designer as she married Harry in a spectacular service at the th Century chapel. Today, the scene was set once more for a showstopping wedding. But this time, it was the turn of the Queens granddaughter and drinks executive Jack Brooksbank to take centre stage in the church. However, the couples ceremony was noticeably more muted than Harry and Meghans - as Zara pointed out to the Duke of Sussex. On the earlier occasion, loud cheers and screams from well-wishers outside the Gothic church could be heard by those inside it.

The seating was laid out dferently, perhaps to accommodate the bigger crowd, with guests chairs lined out facing into the aisle. At about .am, a hush fell over the chapel. Attendees took their seats against the backdrop of music from the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. The brides arrival was heralded by trumpeters lined out at the back of chapel - which startled some members of the young bridal party. Prince George was spotted putting his hands over his ears. The mischievous five-year-old had royal fans in stitches as he giggled hysterically and picked his nose at points throughout the day.  Chosen as a page boy by Eugenie and Jack, he was seen laughing with his seven-year-old cousin Savannah Phillips as they stood in the chapel. Dressed in a smart little suit, he appeared greatly amused as little Savannah tipped her head back and pretended to play a trumpet. He was also seen craning his neck to take in his surroundings, apparently curious to be at the second royal wedding of the year at the chapel. His younger sister, Princess Charlotte, was a bridesmaid - as was Mia Tindall, the daughter of Zara and her rugby player husband Mike. George and Charlotte have a lot of wedding experience, having already been page boy and bridesmaid for at least three other couples. At todays wedding, bride Eugenie made her entrance in a Peter Pilotto and Christopher De Vos wedding dress and an emerald tiara. She waved to crowds as she arrived at the chapels West Steps in a  Rolls Royce Phantom VI, which belongs to the Queen. She was accompanied by her proud dad, the Duke of York.

They shared a photo of her in a fitted teal skirt, saying: This was a few days ago. If Meghan is pregnant, she doesnt have to hide it yet. Whatshe just wanted for Eugenie to have all the attention today Aside from the fact that she wasnt showing a bump at recent official engagements, theres one big clue Harry and Meghan arent about to hear the sound of tiny feet.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are travelling to Sydney, Australia on Tuesday to begin their tour of commonwealth countries. During the trip they will be visiting Fiji and Tonga, which are deemed moderate risk for the Zika virus. The disease is spread by mosquitoes, and while it isnt harmful for most people it can be very serious for pregnant women. It can cause birth defects, including abnormally small heads. The Government advises pregnant women to postpone non-essential travel until the end of their pregnancy. So its very unlikely Harry and Meghan would choose to have children before travelling to this area.

Doctors say the two-month-old boy suffers near-continuous seizures and should be allowed to die. They say he has a very severe brain abnormality, is in a poor condition, and should get palliative care only. Ms Justice Russell analysed the dispute at a public hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London on Friday. She is expected to announce her decision in the near future. The little boy is being treated at a hospital in the north of England but the judge says journalists must not reveal his identity or name the NHS trust with responsibility for his care. Specialists say the boy, who weighs . kilograms - about seven-and-a-half pounds - suffers near-continuous seizures which are resistant to treatment.  One doctor told Ms Justice Russell that the little boy has a low level of awareness but can feel pain and has been seen to grimace. Specialists said the burdens of treatment outweigh the benefits. But the woman said her son has responded to her and his father. When you call him by his name he looks at you, she said. When you bend down and do nose-to-nose he likes it... and he has a little smile which he gives you.

Eugenie looked stunning as she entered the chapel in her beautul dress and a tiara encrusted with emeralds - which shes borrowed from none other than the Queen. The princess opted not to wear the wedding veil - bucking the tradition, unlike Meghan Markle - and theres a fascinating reason why. Brides historically have worn veils as a symbolic reference to their virginity and modesty, although these days lots of brides wear them just for tradition. But there may be a dferent reason why Princess Eugenie has shunned the veil.  Princess Eugenie had a surgery for her scoliosis when she was a child and its left a scar on her back. Ahead of the wedding, she revealed in an interview with ITVs This Morning that it was really important to her not to hide her scoliosis surgery scars. She told host Eamonn Holmes: I had an operation when I was  on my back, and youll see on Friday, but its a lovely way to honour the people who looked after me and a way of standing up for young people who also go through this. I think you can change the way beauty is, and you can show people your scars and I think its really special to stand up for that.  So thats one really important one. Eugenie was diagnosed with scoliosis when she was  years old and received treatment to straighten her spine at the National Orthopaedic Hospital. People on social media have noticed the move from Princess Eugenie - and have tweeted their dfering opinions on the matter. One said: Oh my gosh Eugenie looks amazing.

Even though she is only ninth in line to the throne, and the crowds were thinner than on her cousin Harry’s big day in May, Britain’s most dedicated royal well-wishers saw out the day in style. Dressed head-to-toe in a union jack suit Joseph Afrane, , said he came to pay tribute to a country who had saved his le  years ago when he came from Ghana as a refugee. He said: “The Queen is our head of state and this is her granddaughter - we should be here for her because she has been here for us, always. Despite the small crowds the royal fans were determined to get the most from the big day - singing the national anthem and ‘get them to the church on time’ while wrapped in flags.  A dedicated core who had slept out since earlier in the week to get the best spots found that they didn’t face much competition for the best spaces. But they say the time is all part of the atmosphere for them - letting them soak up the spirit of the day and swap stories of better attended royal events in the past. For -year-old Terry Hutt from Weston-Super-Mare getting a glimpse of the royal couple meant sleeping out on the street last night. “I’ve been coming to every royal event I could for the last  years, I wasn’t going to miss this,” he said. “Obviously the level of excitement isn’t quite what it was for Harry and Meghan’s wedding but it is our royal family and more people should be here to support them “Eugenie looked beautul in her dress.” Some braved the cold for even longer.  Kerry Evans, , from Barton-Upon-Humber arrived on Tuesday and has camped out since. She said she came to pay tribute to a family who she said gave her strength when she raised her two autistic sons. She said: “Looking at the royals I’ve always seen a family that looked like mine and I have always taken a lot from that. “Big crowds or not, it was a gorgeous day and I wouldn’t have missed it for the world.” But not everyone felt they got the most from their hours of waiting outside Windsor Castle’s walls. One man who had been waiting for three days to see the carriage procession said he was “thoroughly disappointed”. Bartly Graham, from County Durham also arrived on Tuesday.  The -year-old said: “I did Harry and Meghan’s wedding and it was a much larger affair. “I’m thoroughly disappointed that we didn’t have the general horse displays and the military aspect, I’m really disappointed.” But the mood for these most dedicated fans was summed up by American Maggie Doyle, , who came all the way from Brussels where she studies to watch the day unfold. She said: “She could be the th in line to the throne and I’d still be here! “I thinkI was British I would be frustrated though, knowing my tax was funding this.” "},{"url":null,"title":"weekend weather forecast storm callum","story":"NewsWeekend weather forecast: Storm Callum to batter UK with mph winds and downpoursA business group has warned the bad weather could cost the economy as much as £ millionShareCommentsByMirror:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video met-office-weekend-weather-report-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Storm Callum is set to unleash mph winds and downpours across the UK this weekend.An amber weather warning has been issued across Scotland, Wales, southern, western and northern England by Government environment officials ahead of the severe storm. And a business group has claimed the bad weather could cost the economy as much as pound million. The impact of cancelled flights, trains and standstill traffic means that firms could lose out on delayed deliveries and stranded staff.Met Office meteorologist Matthew Box said: On Saturday there will be rain pushing into South West Wales, parts of Ireland, England and Scotland.For Saturday, the Met Office has issued an amber rain warning for South Wales and very strong winds on Saturday. There is a risk of floods and risk to travel so I advise everyone keep updated with local weather reports, he continued. Areas such as South West Wales, Cornwall and Devon will see very strong gusts on Saturday morning. Winds will reach up to mph. Conditions are expected to improve by Sunday with dry sunny spells during the day but possible showers in the north later on.  Today hundreds of homes have been left without power, falling trees and high seas are causing major disruption with weather warnings expected to remain in place until Saturday evening. Roads across Devon have been blocked by debris and standing water as flights and trains cancelled in the face of winds at more than mph and up to a weeks rain falling in a few hours. All CrossCountry trains are stopped in and out of Devon - not passing beyond Exeter or Plymouth so they do not cross the Dawlish sea wall. Falling trees caused delays for passengers in Plymouth and Cornwall this morning. Flybe cancelled all flights in and out of Exeter until this afternoon when the weather was expected to improve.  Tim Jones, chairman of the South West Business Council, said: With an extreme weather event like this, we reckon that the impact on business to be around pound million in terms of access to work and fracturing the supply chain which relies so heavily on just-in-time deliveries. The greatest rupturing is still on our road network, the fragility of having just one single artery, the M, into the region is exposed when we have bad weather. Mr Jones said that air travel has remained the most resilient in the face of bad weather but the resilience of the railway remains a priority for economic leaders. He said: This re-emphasises the impact of the vulnerable Dawlish sea wall and other flood prone areas, like Cowley Bridge.

First seen by the Quickbird Two as it travelled over the Canadian wilderness in September , the image confused many experts. The photos showed giant worm-like structures emerging from the forest, according to the Science Channel. Biologist Rob Nelson said: It really looks like some writhing of white worms. Theres no obvious beginning or end. Just how big are they   Andrew Robertshaw, a military historian, while looking at the image, said: It doesnt show anything that makes any logical sense. But a closer look at the image showed a large rectangular man-made structure that was the key to the mystery. An inspection on the ground showed the worms were actually massive piles of rock and gravel.  They would pick up gold bearing gravel, washes out and collect the gold out, before throwing the waste out the back. In turn creating weaving, lines of gravel that appear to emerge from the ground. And the huge structure was actually a massive dredging machine.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities. Alzheimer Scotland wants to make sure that people with dementia and their carers can work with local decision makers, helping to influence important decisions about how vital care and support is delivered in their area.We need your help to ensure people with dementia and carers get the best possible standard of care and support, anywhere in Scotland.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a  minute  second run being  seconds quicker then Phil Dye and  seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteranfemale category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year.

All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at ::, in second place was Sarah Grfin at :: and Louise Gibson at :: in third place.Team EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were  teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

It means the state-of-the-art school is well on track for opening its doors to pupils and staff in October . Built in the grounds of the existing academy, the new school is keenly anticipated as it’s set to not only transform learning and teaching, but will also signicantly enhance facilities for the local community. The new building will have space for up to  young people, with modern classrooms, massive games hall, two all-weather pitches, games courts and a host of other exciting facilities which are sure to impress pupils, staff and the wider public. Kier Construction is building the school, which is being delivered by South Ayrshire Council in partnership with hub South West. The project is part of a poundmillion programme of works delivered across South Ayrshire with the aim of boosting education standards through targeted investment in schools and communities. Councillor Peter Henderson, the council’s resources and performance portfolio holder, said: “Our new, extended and refurbished schools are completely transforming learning across South Ayrshire and the new Queen Margaret Academy is shaping up to do more of the same. We’re committed to creating modern learning environments that not only inspire children and young people, but provide an important hub and network for the local community. “We want those attending our schools to achieve their full potential when they move on from school and our focus on providing the best education possible, with the best facilities, means we are on our way to achieving this ambition. “Our schools always play a key role in local le so we’re ensuring that their excellent sports facilities can be accessed by the wider public. We also ensure there are areas of our schools that can be used by community groups and the new Queen Margaret Academy will be no dferent.” Michael McBrearty, chief executive of delivery partner, hub South West Scotland, said: “The new school will be a fantastic contemporary and innovative learning environment that will create an abundance of opportunities and benefits to the entire community.” Brian McQuade, managing director of Kier Construction Scotland  north-east England, said: “Up to  people have been on site during peak periods of activity and to date we have created one apprenticeship, seven work placements and three student summer intern placements. This has provided young local talent the opportunity to gain valuable experience working on a state-of-the-art building and a unique insight into the built environment and the erse range of roles available.” Oonagh Browne headteacher at Queen Margaret Academy said: “It’s exciting to see our new school taking shape. Parents, young people and staff were crucial in planning the facilities for our new school, so it’s very much their project and this only increases their anticipation”. The Bishop of Galloway, Right Reverend William Nolan said: “While the ground works were taking place little seemed to be happening on site but in recent months the structure of the building has sprung up, giving a sense of excitement and anticipation as we look forward to the completion next year of a centre of learning that will inspire our young people.” When the new school opens, the old building will be demolished and the site fully landscaped.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEducationSchoolsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"60k christmas lights up grabs","story":"Alexandra McCready switches on the lights with the help of the cast of the Ayr Gaiety pantomime Cinderella.\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pound, Christmas lights fund is up for grabs in villages and towns needing an illumination boost. But where the cash goes will be decided by South Ayrshire council officials depending on the needs of dferent areas. The move was approved at the full council meeting last week after a heated clash between rival councillors. Councillor Hugh Hunter put forward a motion for pound, cash to be distributed with a maximum of pound going to each town and pound for villages. He said communities faced a major challenge to raise money for lights. He said the council’s “huge” underspend should be used to pay for the festive displays. But his seasonal gesture was snubbed by ruling councillors who backed an amendment from Councillor Alec Clark to make pound, available instead. Independent Councillor Clark said: “We will try and bring some joy into people’s lives.” His amendment said: “With this fund it is important that the funding does not supplant or compete with the work that has been taking place over a number of years.” Conservative Councillor Hunter questioned how communities were supposed to apply for the cash but was told there wouldn’t be an application process. Labour Councillor Brian McGinley said: “There has been an issue with Christmas lights over a number of years.” He added: “We don’t want to undo the good work already going on in the community.” Responding to probes from the conservative opposition, he said: “We will talk to people about the current arrangements and do what we can.” Councillor Hunter said: “I can’t support the amendment. I ask councillors to support the clear motion.” Speaking after the meeting, Councillor Hunter said: “It wasn’t clear how communities could access it. It is really foggy and disappointing that we couldn’t get to the bottom of it.” Councillor Bob Pollock said he is concerned “some areas may miss out.” He said there was “no coherent explanation” on how the money would be “decided or managed” with only six weeks left until switch on. In a press release Councillor McGinley said: “We obviously have a finite amount of resources, so we know that we won’t be able to do everything that communities want right away, but it’s a terric starting point that will support people and places right across South Ayrshire at this special time of year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilChristmasAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire student launches campaign against","story":"NewsAyrshire student launches campaign against spikingCara’s drive to keep young women safer when they’re out on the town.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsCara Taven has launched a Facebook page named Girls Against Spiking. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA campaign has been set up to raise awareness of people having their drinks spiked. Cara Taven, from Coylton, set up a Facebook page called ‘Girls Against Spiking’to bring to light the effects of spiking on nights out and to, hopefully, eradicate it. The Facebook page, which has gained a following of over  people in one week, hopes to attract the attention of nightclubs and bars and is aiming for lids to be put on all drinks served at their bars as part of a drive to stop people having their drinks spiked.  Cara, , told the Post about her campaign. She said: “I have heard a lot about people getting spiked recently, in my local area and in the Glasgow region, and I know that a lot of people in Ayr do go out in Glasgow. “It tends to be younger girls about my age that get affected by spiking and that was something I have really started to think about. “This is something that could happen to anyone. “I’m a law student and the reason why I wanted to study law was to represent people who maybe don’t have the confidence to represent themselves and to make a dference that way and I think that is where getting the idea to make the page has come from. “I honestly thought it would be a page where the girls at my work could like – I am surprised by the response. “I remember saying to someone at work ‘If you like the page it’ll take me to  likes’ – then when I woke up in the morning and it was . “I haven’t been affected by spiking – it’s not really about me or anyone that I know. It is about the community of girls my age. “ I just felt like the answer was there and no one has done anything about it until now.” The Post reported how Cleo Smillie, , from Ayr, was on a night out in Madrid with her friend, Marc Davies, when she blacked out after one sip of her pink gin and lemonade. It was later learned that she had a high level of GHB in her blood – the date-rape drug. Strathclyde Union is among the nightclubs and bars that were prompted by the campaign and have gone on to order  lids on a trial basis as they work on ways to keep students as safe as possible on nights out.

Arnold Clark took the decision to shut the twin showrooms and workshops in the town’s Lochside. The big transporters moved in to clear the stock and the famous yellow signage was quickly taken down. The old premises in Galloway Avenue sold cars for generations and was probably best known as the home of Robert McCall Fiat and Alfa Romeo. But being stuck in the middle of housing, the old showroom has now outlived its time.. Arnold bought the dealership from Robert McCall and latterly operated a Fiat franchise. It also had the Jeep franchise for Ayr before it moved to Border Cars. The McCall family ran it for decades and built a reputation for fine service. Bob McCall began selling cars in  and had a series of franchises including Jaguar. His son Robert then took over the running of the business and was very successful selling Fiats and Alfas. Robert’s cousin Peter McCall was actually born in the house on the site that was converted into part of the garage. Customers in Galloway Avenue have been told all servicing work is going to the Ford workshop in Prestwick Road. Arnold Clark also runs separate Toyota, Vauxhall and Peugeot franchises in the town as well as a car and van hire centre. A long-time customer in Galloway Avenue said: “It is a real shame, but I guess dealerships want to be on busy roads in more modern buildings. Sadly Galloway Avenue would have needed a lot of investment and a member of staff said it simply was not in the right location any more. “Staff think the site could be flattened or put to another vehicle use.” Arnold Clark was unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsMotoring NewsAlfa RomeoFiatJaguarJeepPeugeotFishingPrestwickGalloway"},{"url":null,"title":"gymnastics club tries takeover council","story":"NewsGymnastics club tries to takeover council activity centre in TroonMuirhead Activity Centre is the target of Dundonald Gymnastics ClubShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA plan by a gymnastics club to take over Muirhead Activity Centre has met hostility. Secret talks have been taking place since the summer but have only just surfaced. Dundonald Gymnastics Club is ready to take control and turn the popular sports hall into a specialist centre. It would mean no more sports lets of the main hall for football, badminton and handball, the squash court would shut and the property would be shted from South Ayrshire Council ownership. Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association fired the first warning shot over the takeover. Chairman Frances Carson said: “The answer is no. If the council have pulled a fly one over this then they will never hear the end of it from this community.” Scott Telford, head coach of the gymnastics club, promised this week he will speak to the community about his ambitious plans. But Tory councillor Peter Convery slammed the secrecy, saying: “This came out of the blue to all the councillors and community and is an utter disgrace. “People at a meeting on Friday night were flabbergasted the hall could be taken out of council ownership. “The acid on the cake is the council has been speaking to the group without anyone knowing. “The council should not be treating its citizens this way.” Scott Telford said he has a full business plan for the centre and believes it can work. The club has  members and a waiting list of  more. He said the club have restricted facilities at their present base Dundonald Activity Centre, where five adults spend hours setting out and dismantling equipment. As a result they cannot develop youngsters to elite performance level and lose talented performers at an early age. Former top gymnast Scott, who lives in Muirhead, said: “The community will still get use of the centre for things like meetings and birthday parties and we would look to develop that. “There will also be the chance for the community to take part in gymnastics. “I appreciate people don’t like change but we can make this work. We could even look at parkour gymnastic sessions with teenagers on Friday night. “There is also a lot of outdoor space which we could change for other activities, depending on what the community want.” The dad first started helping at Dundonald when there were only  kids and ten mats. He added: “At the moment we get about  inquiries a week and just cannot cope. “I want to work with the Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association and want to hear all views. “We will be running a seven-day-a-week facility but it has to be financially sustainable and work with the community.” Councillor Craig Mackay said he wants full transparency when consultation starts. He said: “The onus will be on the gymnastics club to demonstrate the wider support of the community. “I am relaxed about the process and will very much wish to take on board the community’s views on this once we know the details of what is proposed. “I am concerned about how any potential transfer would impact on the use of the centre by the wide range of groups who currently use it. “The centre currently runs at a small but manageable loss and in my view any decision must be made on what is best for the community and not on the very minimal cost savings.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsGymnasticsSouth Ayrshire CouncilBadmintonTroonDundonald"},{"url":null,"title":"shops replace homes new ayr","story":"NewsShops to replace homes in new Ayr town centre regeneration plansPeople to have their say on radical proposalsShareBySarah Hilley:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShops are to be replaced with homes in Ayr town centreradical new plans get the go-ahead. Proposals also include the High Street being coated with a new easy clean surface and bins being kept out of site. A great shop clearance has been proposed to regenerate the ailing shopping strip. South Ayrshire Council wants empty retail units to become homes at the bottom of the town. Council leader Douglas Campbell said: “Internet shopping has signicantly altered the landscape in the town. “We need people back staying in the towns.” SNP Councillor Campbell took to his feet at week’s full council meeting to talk through the complete overhaul of the town centre. Conservative Councillor Ian Davis askedshop owners would be consultedthey are forced to move. He said: “This could mean some businesses will have to move. I want reassurances for businesses thatan area is to be reused for a dferent purpose that they are well consulted.” The meeting heard businesses would be consulted. The cleared Riverside block, which included Woolworths, would become a public square. The original proposal for a huge office block has been shelved. Commenting on the cleared site, Councillor Campbell said: “None of us expected the vista.” But he conceded how homes of some description could be erected on the site. He said: “Some sort of building on the site will be necessary.” A report submitted to council said: “There will also be the potential for a small number of residential units on the Riverside sitethis proves desirable through the public consultation exercise.” Council staff from soon-to-be demolished Burns House are likely to move into the Clydesdale Bank Building, the Town Hall and County Buildings instead. The Citadel is to be replaced with a brand new state-of-the art leisure centre on the High Street. A new streetscape surface could also be on the way. Councillor Campbell said: “If we are going to revamp the High Street we need to do it in a signicant way to keep it tidy. “During the main shopping times all the bins should be off the street. We need to present the High Street well. “We need to move the bus stops away from the Clydesdale Bank building.” Conservative opposition councillor Hugh Hunter got to his feet to “welcome” the report. He said: “It would be spectacular for the administrationthey could pull it off.” He called for a park like Belleisle to be built at the Riverside. SNP councillor Siobhian Brown said she welcomed the report but said morale of the community was “on its knees.” All plans will be issued for public consultation.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnClydesdale BankScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"slow progress new troon mega","story":"NewsSlow progress for new Troon mega surgeryBut work on Templehill expansion should start next yearShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNational Health top brass have been summoned to Troon to explain what is happening to expansion plans at the town’s mega surgery. Members of the public spoke at last week’s Troon Community Council –asking why there has been no obvious progress at the Templehill Surgery in nearly six month. The surgery swallowed most of the collapsed  Medical Practice, re-opening with , patients at the end of April. The Community Council has asked an NHS representative to attend their meeting next month. When Templehill took over they were to be handed around pound, by NHS Ayrshire  Arran for an extension. And partner Robbie Cumming said then it was still to be agreed wether to use a ready-made modular building or a traditional build at the back. At the time he said: “We intend to expand and develop our current premises with the addition of two or three consulting rooms, disabled access doors and a larger reception area.” A planning application has been lodged but it has not even been “validated” yet by South Ayrshire Council. Councillor Craig Mckay has quizzed Pamela Milliken, head of primary care, on the extension which had been a central plank of the transfer. Councillor Mckay said: “I welcome the Health Board’s comments which suggest that there have been no major issues following the transfers. “This is consistent with my own experience as I’ve received no recent complaints from patients. “It is also reassuring that both recipient practices have been reviewing patient records and inviting patients to attend for review appointments. “I hope this will ensure that those who were moved will continue to receive the level of care they deserve. “On the extension to the Templehill surgery, the planning application has recently been submitted but not yet validated. ““Clearly it is in the interests of all patients of that practice that the required expansion takes place, and I note that subject to there being no planning issues, work is expected to begin on site in the new year. “The extension was central to the arguments made when  Medical Practice closed, and the ball is now firmly in the Surgery’s court to deliver on this commitment.” Councillor Bob Pollock agreed the actual transition process seemed to have gone well and said: “None of the Troon Councillors have received any complaints following the merger of the surgeries, butthere are any, they should get in touch.” Ms Milliken said: “Planning permission for the work was submitted to South Ayrshire Council on Friday September . The practice is optimistic that works will commence in early Januaryplanning permission is granted.” In other NHS news, it is understood community midwives have had to change their base from the Barassie Street clinic to Prestwick. One source said: “All that is left at Barassie Street seems to be podiatry. “The community nurses have to start their sht in Prestwick before coming to Troon for their first appointment.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonNHS ScotlandAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"council-approves-building-of-57-affordable-homes","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has approved plans to build  affordable homes in Chirnside.Springfield Properties, which is based in Elgin, Moray, plans to build a new affordable housing estate behind Northfield terrace, with an access point on Main Street East End.The developers have also confirmed that the scheme will be taken over by a local affordable housing provider which will wholly own and operate the development.However, the proposals have been met with several objections from Chirnside residents, who raised concerns around road access, parking, housing density and the impact on local house prices.Mrs Margaret Thomson Malone, a neighbour of the proposed site, wrote: ldquoThere will be numerous traffic jams, there already are several times a day when two heavy lorries meet on a road packed with parked cars.ldquoWhere do you think all the people who would live in these houses are going to park when it snows or is covered in ice as it is every winter at some point ldquoSeveral people have now decided to sell their houses.

identied major repair and refurbishment works were required.Engineers arrived at Galafoot on August  to begin the scheduled  weeks of work.But by early September it emerged the scale of deterioration in both the concrete sections and steel reinforcements beneath the surface was much greater than initially anticipated.Amey announced that full night-time closures would be required to finish the deck repairs, waterproofing and resurfacing by the scheduled October .But with just over a week until the planned completion date they have extended the timescales through to November.And bosses have also announced that engineers willto complete the extensive repairs in February.Ameys bridges manager Stuart Wallace said: ldquoThese refurbishment works were originally intended to prevent the further deterioration of the bridge structure by repairing defects at an early stage.\"This work has subsequently uncovered several previously hidden defects that far exceeded expectations and this is the reason for the increase to the construction programme.Since the introduction of a one-way system for west-bound traffic across the bridge with east-bound vehicles having to use the winding B near Abbotsford, there have been many reports of drivers ignoring temporary road signs.And many other drivers are using Melrose Road and Lowood Bridge, which causes tailbacks at rush hour.Rather than continue with repairs to Galafoot over the festive period and into the new year, Amey has opted to finish on November  andthree months later.Mr Wallace added: ldquoThe local community has shown incredible patience and understanding with the repair programme to date.\"Having listened to their concerns, we consider it prudent to avoid further disruption over the busy holiday season.\"This strategy will also mitigate against the possible impact that winter weather might have on this workldquoOnce again, we want to thank road users, businesses and residents for their goodwill, and we will continue to consult with local stakeholders and provide updates on this scheme .Exact dates for the  works will be announced in the coming

team and heard directly about their concerns.I have also contacted Argyll and Bute Council#s planning department numerous times, and, on September , I spoke with James Macintyre of Macleod Construction and made my views very clear on this matter.The potential new G pitch and footpath are much needed and more than welcome.That said there have clearly been large failings in the consultation process and this must not happen in future.In order to find the best way forward MacLeods will need to move rugby posts to new positions, using new sleeves and with an Islay Rugby presence during the operation.Leveling off of the west side of the pitch must be carried out using good soil with a view to extending the level pitch by several meters.Material for a ryelock fence should be provided by MacLeods and or others, and permissions given for construction of a standard fence.This fence should run between the timber fence at the rear of the housing estate and the timber fence at the car park, in a line running along the pitch side edge of the new path across the rugby pitch.This should make the extended area as near dog-free as possible and solve the serious fouling problem which unfortunately continues to exist.Regardless of how many of my fellow Ileachs feel, about where this pathway has been built and the lack of proper communication, the hard working front line workers, of Macleods are only following orders and any hostility directed towards them is unhelpful and unfair.If these changes and additions to the building works are made all parties will be happy and Islay will have a terric rugby pitch.Bowmore locals will have a new foot path and Islay can hopefully look forward to the prospect of a wonderful new G pitch in the future.Despite the upset

It was a lovely calm and sunny day, perfect for filming,I was halfway through the story when a group of local teenage lads approached. It seemed they were drinking and I anticipated them disrupting the filming.But I continued telling the story as it had been a perfect take up until that moment.The lads paused for a moment then all sat on the concrete walkway watching me and the film makers. They said nothing and seemed to be listening.I was able to complete my story uninterrupted.And as I walked away in the final shot I made eye contact with the lads and they respectfully waited until the filming had stopped before shouting, ldquoJohnny Moat forever! Then they got up and walked away.It was an unexpected and powerful moment for me.My assumptions about the lads had been utterly challenged as well.This was more than six years ago but I was reminded of it when I visited Johnny Moat this week with my wee boy Lewis.We were having our weekly storytelling walk in the Pans, a three-hour period between his nursery pick up and when I have to pick up his sister Skye from the Infant School.We just walk together visiting dferent places, and I tell him stories and he does the same.Most of his stories this day involved a T Rex or Raptor, which in his imagination wander about Prestonpans.So our respective tales were a bit dferent in content and style, but what is vital at this age is that he hears stories and is allowed to tell them freely.I told him the story of Johnny Moat and he said it looks like a whale.As we wandered from Johnny Moat up to Preston Tower, we stopped at what we call the lsquoStory Stonesrsquo.Here a small circle of stones sit underneath a cherry tree, with the tower looming behind. It is a perfect place to tell stories.Lewis gave me a new version of his T Rex tale here. I couldnrsquot understand all his story, but I got most of it.Then he said it was my turn so I told him a child-friendly version of the tale of the Green Lady. It made him want to go and look in the windows of the tower, which we did.The final story began at the old doorsquocot in the gardens by the tower. I explained it was a house for pigeons, but Lewis was having none of that.ldquoNo daddy, he said with a serious face, ldquoa lion lives there.ldquoReally  Can you tell me the story of the lion  I asked. And so he obliged.It was a great story, and we tracked the lion to the ancient Mercat Cross, where the unicorn sits on top of the pole ldquolooking for the lion.Then he spotted the lion on the  bus coming from Tranent.ldquoWill it eat the people  I asked.ldquoNo, he said asIrsquod asked an inappropriate question, ldquoitrsquos a nice lion.And so with the lion having left town, we headed for the Infant School to pick up his sister, but still keeping a look out for the T Rex.On the surface this may all seem a bit unusual, wandering about telling random stories that often didnrsquot make huge sense.But I value this time with my son, and as a storyteller I know the importance of it.Storytelling in this way when our kids are young helps develop what is called oral narrative ability, which gives a child the skills to explain and describe things, and develop their understanding of words and language.It fires their imagination and research shows that this can help with the enjoyment of reading and writing later on, and of telling and hearing stories.That night my son unexpectedly ed to the story of Johnny Moat.I had earlier told him it had fallen down and is lying face down in the sand and itrsquos too heavy to put back, but hopefully one day there will be a way.Like all kids his age, he took a while to process his thoughts on this. And these thoughts came out at bedtime.ldquoThe T Rex can put the big stone back, he said. I admired his total faith in the abilities of the T Rex.ldquoYes, maybe, I said. He fell asleep holding his T Rex which, for him, symbolises so much more than just an extinct dinosaur.As I headed downstairs, I thought about the connection between this day and the day over six years ago when I unexpectedly told the story of Johnny Moat to some teenage lads.Stories weave through us and bind us in a shared identity. But it made me sad that Johnny Moat still lies forgotten with his face in the sand.So Irsquom going to start looking for the T Rex of the Pans, whoever that may be, who can help. He or she must be out there somewhere.

Activists have to content themselves with the thin gruel of ldquoperseverance, pragmatism and patience. Her conference speech was almost Presbyterian in its downbeat realism: you can wave all the flags you want, but therersquos no short cut to independence.Most of her troops get this. The SNP MP Angus MacNeill used precisely the wrong historical analogy when he urged Nicola Sturgeon not to ldquodither like the Jacobites at Derby . Modern Scottish nationalists, like Nicola Sturgeon, loathe comparisons with Bonnie Prince Charlie and heroic failures like the lsquo. Nor is she an enthusiast for the politics of naive optimism.She knows that, evenopinion polls started showing a majority in favour of independence, Theresa May is not going to allow another referendum in the foreseeable future. Westminster must pass a so-called Section  Order to legitimise a referendum on the constitution, and the PM made clear last year that shersquos not going to table one. MPs would probably reject itshe did. For her part, Ms Sturgeon has repeatedly made clear she will not entertain any illegal referendums, not least because Unionists would boycott them, as in Catalonia in .This is not going to change any time soon. In her ldquonow is not the time interview in March , Mrs May gave three reasons for refusing a Section . First, that voters are confused right now second, that a second independence referendum would interfere with negotiations over Brexit and third, that Scots need to know what the future relationship with the EU is going to be before making up their minds about relations with the UK. Ms Sturgeon agrees that the ldquofog of Brexit as she put it yesterday, has to clear before any sensible choice can be made about Scottish independence. That ldquotriple mandate for independence,she won last year is not enough.But will the fog clear  EvenMrs May s with an acceptable exit deal before Christmas, the confusion over Brexit will be far from over. Any deal with Brussels will be limited to the orce bill, EU citizensrsquo rights and the Irish backstopand this will not be the end of Brexit uncertainly. It wonrsquot even be the end of the beginning.The latest version of the Chequers deal,appears to involve the UK remaining in the Customs Union until a ldquofriction-free solution emerges to trade across the Irish border. This is the so-called ldquoblind Brexit under which Britain leaves the EU in March without any clarity about future trading relations. It suits hard Brexiters because once wersquore out, wersquore out.But this half-in-half-out arrangement is not just confined to the transition period, which is supposed to end in . Indeed, it will almost certainly continue after that. My reading of the negotiations is that Britain is heading towards a ldquoSwitzerland minus outcome. The Swiss are not members of the EU, or the EEA or formally the European Single Market. However, they accept all the rules of the ESM on a ldquobilateral basis, meaning that they accept changes as they come along, not en masse, as it were.Itrsquos a fine distinction, and most people agree that Switzerland is in the single market for all intents and purposes. It accepts the four freedoms, including freedom of movement, and largely rubber-stamps rulings of the European Court of Justice. However, it is not actually in the ESM, which makes it Brexit-compliant. Mrs May will try to get a Switzerland-type deal, minus any formal acceptance of freedom of movement. But this will likely be fudged over a y transition in which the destination will be clear, but neither side will openly admit it.Except for Ms Sturgeon, who will want to call a spade a spade. If there is a transition deal that explicitly confirms regulatory alignment for Northern Ireland with the single market ndash which is what the ldquohybrid backstop also seems to involve ndash she will rightly call for Scotland to get parity. The Northern Ireland back-stop is similar to the hybrid arrangement she proposed for Scotland in the Scottish Government White Paper, Scotlandrsquos Place in Europe, back in . .But the downside is that Brussels and the UK could end up with an open-ended transition period in which Britain is out of the European Union, but remains in an uncertain relationship to its institutions. This means Scottish voters could be no clearer on our long-term relations with Europe than they are now. This purgatory could easily last  years, during which no UK government will agree to an independence referendum for Scotland, on the grounds that nothing is clear until everything is clear.I suspect realisation that the fog of Brexit is going to linger helped persuade the First Minister, belatedly, to support a Peoplersquos Vote on Brexit. On the BBC Andrew Marr show she made clear SNP MPs will vote for a repeat referendum on Brexit, eventhere is no guarantee of indyref. The polls may indicate that support for independence would rise with a hard Brexit, but it is much better for the cause of Scottish independencethe UK doesnrsquot leave the EU at all. It would mean Scotland could seamlessly depart from the UK without there being any hard border with England, and without Scotland having to formally leave the EU.There is now a slim chance that a Peoplersquos Vote might happen. That Britain will wake up from the Brexit nightmare. But that would be a triumph of hope over experience."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/2237318.jpg?type=article-full","title":"call-for-consumer-helpline-to-get-scots-out-of-fuel-poverty","story":"The advice line is one of the recommendations in a Citizens Advice Scotland report that warns that over one in ten Scottish households are using electric heating - the most expensive form of domestic fuel ndash and three times as costly as gas.It finds that those who rely on electric heat are almost twice as likely to be in fuel poverty compared to the population of Scotland as a whole.The report found that many using electricity are on low incomes and unlikely to access the support that is available or to switch to cheaper fuel sources.Official figures show that .% of all Scots households are in fuel poverty, meaning that they spend more than % of household income on fuel.:Government urged to take real action on fuel poverty in Warm Homes BillBut the report says the fuel poverty figure for electricity users, according to  data, is %, while for gas users it is %.Publishing the Hard Wired Problems report, CAS energy spokesman Craig Salter said that there is a perception that high costs are \"unavoidable and inevitable\" when using electric heating.His Hard Wired Problems report says consumers were receiving \"mixed messages\" about electric heating from dferent organisations such as energy suppliers, installers of energy efficiency measures, governments, the regulator and support agencies \"adding to the confusion\".There were \"misconceptions\" over the benefits of switching and a \"lack of information\" on all electricity-only tarfs.The analysis, assisted by research undertaken by Energy Action Scotland and Glasgow Caledonian University, suggests as one of its recommendations, that the Scottish Government should support the set up of a helpline to provide impartial advice dealing with issues relating to electric heating, including its operation, metering, tarfs, and how to access financial support.This would form part of an expanded \"bespoke service\" aimed at providing expert advice.It also said there was a ldquoclear need for more consistent messaging ldquoacross organisations about electric heating.Mr Salter said: ldquoElectric heating is by far the most costly heating type in Scotland, yet many of the people who use it are those least able to afford it.

The investigation also found just three companies own more than half of Englandrsquos quota while some fishermen hoard quota on vessels which never cast a net.Nearly half of England and Walesrsquo quota is held by companies based outside the those countries, despite reforms to the EUrsquos fisheries policy which encourage national governments to allocate fishing quota on social and environmental grounds.It is claimed that the ownership of quota by large-scale fishing firms also poses greater risk to the environment and fish stocksmore destructive fishing practices are deployed, an allegation strenuously denied by the families themselves.Scottish Greens environment spokesman Mark Ruskell MSP said: ldquoThis investigation should serve as a reminder that much of Scotlandrsquos fishing industry is in the grip of a handful of very rich people ... , many of them putting profit before science, happy to wipe the seas clean rather than manage stocks sustainably so we have food for the future.ldquoFishing industry voices have actively encouraged the kind of deregulated free-for-all the Toriesrsquo Brexit crisis is dragging us toward, posing massive risks to jobs and public services in our coastal communities.  per cent of whatrsquos caught in Scottish waters is sold to the EU so the isolationism of Brexit will ruin our export economy.ldquoIf we want a future for fisheries we need to distribute quotas to more local and sustainable operators.

The huge sums have been made by large-scale fishermen, with five wealthy families controlling one-third of Scotlandrsquos total quota, despite the entire pelagic fleet consisting of just  vessels.But for those outside the big companies, fishing is becoming a less and less profitable pursuit due to a quota system that favours larger enterprises over small vessels.A study by Greenpeacersquos investigative unit claims to reveal a vastly unequal system where a minority of wealthy families control huge swathes of fishing rights to the detriment of local fishermen.In desperation, many small scale fishermen resort to contacting larger outfits, or those they know have Fixed Quota Allocationsthat they do not fish. Those owners can set their own prices and lease out quota, allowing the fisherman to catch more.The prices set for leasing out FQA can y by hundreds of pounds. To lease a tonne of cod for example, can cost from pound to pound. The resulting catch might bring just pound, at market, meaning a profit margin of pound before staff and equipment costs.According to Greenpeace, the situation has left some fishermen going out on boats alone because they cannot afford to pay a crew, while others have found that, after boat costs, they are still losing money and have stopped fishing altogether.Jerry Percy, founder of the Under Ten Fishermenrsquos Association, which represents small scale fishermen, said: ldquoThe fish in our seas are a public resource, itrsquos yours and mine, managed by Government on our behalf. They should therefore never be treated as just another commodity, to be bought and sold to the highest bidder.ldquoThe hoarding of quota risks creating a distorted market in which the price of fish stocks, and access to them, is controlled by just a few companies.The problem, say critics, dates back to the s when economists argued that the problem of diminishing fish stocks brought about by fleet expansion and mass industrialisation should be solved by the market. They proposed that states create a limited right to catch fish that could be bought and sold.Iceland was one of the first countries to implement this market-based policy in the Eighties. Their fish stocks began to recover and the fishing fleet grew more profitable. But the privatisation of once common fishing-rights led to many fishermen becoming dispossessed as banks started trading in fishing rights and the system eventually crashed.In the UK, the price of large fishing boats and their associated right-to-fish has rocketed, which has led to many young people being priced out. In many cases only large companies with the backing of banks can buy boats.Greenpeace hope the UK can succeed where Iceland failed, and rein in the market to create a fairer system.Will McCallum, head of oceans at Greenpeace UK, said: ldquoHow long before the Government stops blaming other countries, looks at its own broken system, accepts responsibility for fixing it and creates a fairer and more sustainable distribution of fishing quota across the UK  With the Fisheries Bill rumoured to be just weeks away, there has never been a better opportunity to do just this.A spokesman for Lunar Fishing said: ldquoThe quota available to the inshore fleetis more than the under-m fleet can catch, so there is no merit in the suggestion that there is disadvantage to the lsquosmall-scale fishermenrsquo.ldquoIn fact the vast majority of fish caught requires larger vessels to catch because of location, depth and weather challenges. It would be impossible for the inshore fleet to catch a small percentage of the quota.ldquoIn relation to workforce, Lunar uses the quota to employ around  people in the local communities of Peterhead, Fraserburgh and Aberdeen. Many more are employed in providing services to the company.A spokesman for Sir Ian Woodrsquos fishing arm, the Don Fishing Co and JW Holdings, said: ldquoBoth come from strong fish catching backgrounds with Sir Ian Woodrsquos father, grandfather and great grandfather all being fishermen. The Don operates as a management and fish selling company working on behalf of about  vessels in which it has mainly minority shares and another  vessels which it helps manage and sell the fish. The Don Corsquos one and only reason for owning some quota itself and helping a large number of fishing vessels to buy their own quota is to enable the vessels to have sufficient quota to be viable.A spokesman for Andrew Marr International said: ldquoAMI fully supports robust fishery management including full compliance to protect fish stocks and sustainable fishing. AMI has  vessels in the English Fully Documented Fishery Scheme with on board camera monitoring.ldquoThe main stocks that AMI fishes for in the North Sea are cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, monkfish. In these species, the Under  fleet have excess quota that they have not used in the last several years.A spokesman for Interfish said: ldquoAcross our fleet we were the first UK fleet to achieve full certication against the Responsible Fishing Scheme in  and maintained this against the new standard in  ndash no other fleet of skippers have achieved this standard.ldquoInterfish are active within several MSC client groups enabling sustainable certication of offshore and inshore fisheries."},{"url":null,"title":"brian-beacom-can-the-new-bbc-scotland-channel-make-scotland-happy","story":"What you do therefore is grab your audience where you can, when you can.

Steve Carson is the man charged with BBC Scotland output, as Head of Multi Commissioning. His television CV suggests hersquos -years -old. . Which all looks great.And he says all the right things. ldquoThe plan for the new channel is to reflect Scotland right back at itself. Now, thatrsquos a toughie, Steve, because Scotland has a history of covering up one eye while looking in the mirror. And the one open eye is a little bloodshot and blurry.We love to see ourselves as a fun-loving, happy collective. The reality is Scotland is ided on so many levels how it sees its future, the importance it places on its past. Scotlandrsquos class ide isnrsquot quite the size of the Nevis range, but itrsquos vast. We live in a little tribal country thatrsquos so often sectarian and loves to get upset with itself. And there are large sections of Scotland which have loved being upset with the BBC.So what are Carson and co going to offer to keep as many of us as possible away from the competition  How is he going to entertain during the five hours of telly a night, from -pm  The five hours will feature a mix of documentaries, factual entertainment programming, comedy, drama and sport. Sounds smashing. The new station will be multi- ndash connected to iPlayer, Radio Scotland, social media and other services. More than  production companies will deliver content. But what sort of content  Much of the target audience will be -, which represents a real challenge. How do you entice young people away from Netflix, YouTubing, wearing their thumbs out on their phones  Well, according to Carsons crew, programmes fronted by the likes of rapper writer Darren McGarvey could make a real mark, his political voice offering up an alternative tour of Scotland.The very funny Grado will front a quiz show and the Peoplersquos News will take in the publicrsquos filmed response to news and topical events. Therersquos also Meet Jamie Genevieve, featuring the YouTube ldquobeauty guru . Given the taster we watched it seems your Auntie Cissie in Kilsyth will find shows such as this a less natural fit than she would a nose ring and ripped jeans.Yet, the new channel isnrsquot ignoring those who prefer TV to be about people rather than what people put on their faces. Documentaries planned include Last Breath, which features the tale of the North Sea er stranded on the seabed with only five minutes of oxygen left. The agedwill sink into this human drama, which incorporates actual footage with the drama.Yes, BBC Scotland would be mad not to spread bet its poundm budget. Thatrsquos why the new channel will let you see River City and Scot Squad before it appears on big BBC.And of course, therersquos the much-demanded news programme. It wonrsquot go out at six, but at nine. And it will have a ldquonew fresh format, although detail of that is to be announced. What we do know however it that it will run for an hour, fronted by Martin Geissler and Rebecca Curran. I donrsquot know Rebecca Curran but Martin Guissler is smarter than a schoolboy at the start of a new term. It sounds exciting.There are also plans under way to broadcast from Scottish theatres, which hasnrsquot been done since . And sport will be covered with discussion forums. But herersquos a little mump wouldnrsquot the new channel be the perfect  for an arts programme, discussing that weekrsquos hi-brow less hi-brow output in Scotland  It could be lively and fun.The world of Scottish theatre alone offers up regular opportunity for strong opinion .It will certainly be fascinating to seeBBC Scotland can get close to its hoped-for  per cent share, to broadcast to as wide as possible demographic, to capture zeitgeist, to reflect Scotland right back at itself, in the way that STV did in  or Radio Clyde in .Interestingly, Gradorsquos Test Drive could be a metaphor for the new channel a car-driving couple progress to their destinationthey answer a series of questions correctly pitched at them by the sat nav. Now, all the signs suggest Steve Carson and his commissioners have a route worked out, they know where they want to be. But only strong programme content will ensure arrival."},{"url":null,"title":"the-scotsman-owner-johnston-press-puts-itself-up-for-sale","story":"The group- which has a stable of titles including the i newspaper - said it is seeking offers for a takeover.The decision comes as a result of a strategic review, which Johnston launched in  to assess options for refinancing pound million of bonds due for repayment next year.The company said it is not currently in discussions with any potential buyers.Speculation that the publisher would be sold has been growing since it announced the strategic review in March .In August , the companys share price spiked, surging by as much as % in afternoon trading amid rumours that a mystery buyer was quietly snapping up more stock.Bidders for the business could include activist shareholder Custos Group, which already owns more than % of Johnston Press.Custos Group, which is headed by Norwegian entrepreneur Christen Ager-Hanssen, reportedly said in August that it would be a prospective bidder for the businessit went into administration.At its most recent trading update, Johnston reported a hit to revenues, mostly due to changes in Google and Facebook algorithms.Total revenue fell % to pound million for the first half of , despite a boost from the i newspaper.In the same period, the company swung out of the red with interim pre-tax profits of pound. million against losses of pound. million a year earlier, although the turnaround was largely thanks to a one-off pound. million accounting gain."},{"url":null,"title":"lightbulb-moment-as-fair-isle-finally-gets-24-hour-electricity-supply","story":"Everything after that had to be was after that was carried out by candlelight or torch, and the long, drawn-out winter evenings became a particular challenge as the intermittent energy supply meant little could get done.But today the remote Fair Isle - located halfway between Orkney and Shetland, and famous for its geometric and colourful knitwear - finally receives guaranteed electricity  hours a day as a new pound. million supply goes live.It comes more than two centuries s after Michael Faraday invented the electric motor and almost  years since Stanley Baldwin established the national grid.Now all Fair Isle inhabitants will have the simple pleasure of instant hot water at any time.Islanders previously faced lights-out between .pm and .am as there was insufficient wind to generate power round-the-clock hours a day via a wind turbine and diesel generators.The island has been using a combination of wind and diesel power generation since the s, but only one of the existing two wind turbines has been working and it only operated intermittently overfor the past three years.Electricity generated could not be stored and there was no space for new customers, so community group the Fair Isle Electricity Company led plans to install three kW wind turbines, a kW solar array and battery storage.The scheme has extended a high-voltage network to the north of the three-mile long island to enable grid connections to water treatment works, the airstrip, the harbour and one of the main attractions on an island famed for its birdle - the Fair Isle Bird Observatory.Community-led Fair Isle Electricity Company , which led the project, now hopes it will help boost the population and make le easier for islanders.FIEC director Robert Mitchell said: ldquoAs an important project in a fragile rural area, having reliable renewable power will make a huge dference now and in the future, and we hope that it will encourage more people to come and live on the island.ldquoIt also provides a great opportunity for more businesses to start here.The idea to revamp the power scheme has been one of the main issues raised by the islandrsquos residents over severalthe last number of years.Fair Isle is home to , puffins but the number of people haslevels of people have dropped to critically low levels. Only  living there now - the lowest in several years.Round-the-clock electricity also comes  years after the island faced complete evacuation, like the Hebrides archipelago of St Kilda.But in  the islandrsquos owner, George Waterson, founded the Bird Observatory, which helped to bring in visitors and boost the economy.In , Waterson also sold the island to the National Trust for Scotland, which helped to modernise housing and improve transportation.And while the population is still considerably smaller than its previous peak height of almost , new people and ideas are helping to keep the islandrsquos community sustainable.Around  people now live on Fair Isle and Islanders have always stressed, however, that the hardships of le there require people of a practical nature.One of Britainrsquos most remote inhabited islands, Fair Isle is raised by precipitous clfs.It is served by a -minute plane flight or a two-and-a-half hour ferry from mainland, Shetlandrsquos main island.But despite its remoteness, the island draws hundreds of visitors a year, mainly ornithologists, as it is one of the best places in Europe to see rare birds make pit stops along their migration routes in spring and autumn.Pharologists are also keen visitors as the island is home to two working lighthouses, both built by the famed Stevenson engineering family.Project leaders hope -hour electricity will support future growth of the islandrsquos community.ldquoThe new energy system will be cleaner and greener and will reduce reliance on expensive diesel, hence making living costs more sustainable, said Mr Mitchell.ldquoItrsquos an ambitious project and is another step in ensuring that the community of Fair Isle continues to thrive.Most islanders have a croft, supplemented by a ersity of business activity but internet speeds are slow.Since the s, it has been powered by two on-island turbines and two diesel generators. However, the kW and W turbines have both been out of action for the last year due to technical problems and a lightning strike.The new system was backed by pound. million from the Scottish Government and pound, from development agency Highlands and Islands Enterprise.Other contributors include the European Regional Development Fund, Shetlands Islands Council and the National Trust for Scotland.Welcoming the new electricity supply, Scottish Minister for Energy, Connectivity and the Islands, Paul Wheelhouse said: ldquoThose of us living on the mainland of Scotland can often take reliable supplies of electricity for granted.ldquoThis has never been possible for the islanders of Fair Isle.ldquoThe reality of having, for the first time in their history, -hour supplies of electricity presents exciting prospects for the Fair Isle community, who will not only benefit from access to a reliable electricity supply around the clock, but also now have in place a new cleaner, greener energy system."},{"url":null,"title":"strikes-loom-as-teachers-urged-to-reject-derisory-pay-offer","story":"The Educational Institute of Scotlandand the Scottish Secondary Teachers Associationare balloting members on the proposed three per cent pay rise with a recommendation to reject it.The EIS is not yet asking its members whether they would support industrial action to fight for a larger pay award.

We are looking to have the future trade agreement and relationship set out almost simultaneouslyhellipWithin days of the withdrawal agreement, we will hopefully be setting out the terms of our future relationship and we want those to come into play on January   so we donrsquot want the backstop ever to be in place.He went on: ldquoThe backstop was there on the basisyou werenrsquot to get the other agreement implemented and, therefore, itrsquos still the case all the focus has to be on the initial agreement being implemented.ldquoIt is fair,there is to be a backstop, to set a time-limit on that backstop so that it couldnrsquot possibly exist either when the principal agreement came into full force or was indefinite so as to allow a situation, which wasnrsquot intended to be the negotiated arrangement for the UK and for Northern Irelandrsquos relationship with the EU to become a permanent fixture, said the Secretary of State.Mr Mundell also insisted reports that the PM was willing to see Northern Ireland remain in the European single market as the rest of the UK left it were untrue. ldquoThere is no plan for Northern Ireland to be in the single market, he declared.The Scottish Secretary stressed how he and Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, had made clear to Mrs May there fundamental opposition to any Brexit carve-out for Northern Ireland as it would undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom.

However, that is not the approach adopted by Highland Council.Mrs Ross said: \"Having raised issues with the council regarding their approach to considering equalities and human rights in their budget process, particularly around the closure of public toilets, it was encouraging to hear that many councils around Scotland have placed such an approach at the heart of their budgeting.

I am grateful to Andy Moir once again for making himself available and to all those we met in Stronsay, who engaged constructively and put forward a number of issues for further consideration.“The key issue raised at the public meeting was undoubtedly the decision by NHS Orkney not to include a helipad on the site of the new Balfour hospital. Concerns were expressed about apparent delays in transferring Isles patients, brought in by air ambulance, from Kirkwall airport to the current Balfour due to a lack of land ambulance capacity.“While it is unlikely that NHS Orkney will reopen the decision on a helipad, ious suggestions were made about how delays in transfer to the hospital might be avoided in future. Mr Moir agreed to take these up with his colleagues responsible for land ambulance provision.

The new strategy will shape the country’s transport priorities for the next  years.Age Scotland and Transport Scotland have said they have been working closely with older people in communities across island, rural and urban Scotland since spring to understand how transport affects older peoples’ daily lives.Gillian Skuse, Charity Director of Age Scotland Orkney, stressed how important it is that local older people get involved in these discussions.“We’ve heard from older people around the islands that transport can impact their mobility, running their errands, enjoying activities and being part of their local communities. This consultation is a great opportunity for older Orcadians’ comments and experiences to help shape future planning for more inclusive, affordable and accessible transport on our islands.”Speaking about the workshop, Age Scotland’s Policy Engagement  Campaigns Officer Simon Ritchie said: “We know that a lack of transport options can be a huge barrier for many older people in the Highlands and Islands living the le they want to live. Around , older people in Scotland don’t see anyone  for at least half a week so easy access to good transport options is vital to older people allowing them to run errands, meet friends and family, make medical appointments and improve their quality of le.#This is a brilliant opportunity for older people in Orkney to share their views on transport and shape the new National Transport Strategy.  Age Scotland and Transport Scotland want to hear how transport works for older Orcadians so that decision-makers can ensure older Orcadians can access the services they need in order to enjoy later le.#“We invite any and all older people in Orkney to come along and share their views with us.”The transport workshop will take place in Finstown on Thursday October  at the Orkney Men#s Shed.

The other sites being considered for the initial roll-out include Glasgow, Ayr, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Fort William, Milngavie, Oban, Inverness and Aberdeen.The units will be fitted with technology that will enable them to digitally track water usage at each Top-up point, transmitting the data via cloud technology to specialists managing Scotland’s water networks. The resulting data will be used to calculate cost and plastic savings, along with the volume of water being consumed.Douglas Millican, Scottish Water chief executive, said: “Our research shows that people feel very positively towards the quality of Scotland’s tap water — now these state-of-the-art taps can provide access to enable water drinkers to enjoy it while on the go by carrying and using refillable bottles.”The Your Water, Your Le campaign aims to make tap the first choice for water drinkers wherever they are, and encourages businesses to make it readily available for staff and customers. Zero Waste Scotland, Keep Scotland Beautul and Scottish Natural Heritage, have also voiced their support.On average, a litre bottle of water costs about p, so topping up daily from the tap, could save £. a day, nearly £ a year.For further information, visit yourwateryourle vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We gave support to the centre by attending their annual fete in August where we donated lots of dog food, and also through the Bags Of Help scheme where they benefited from pound which was voted on by our customers.\"I cannot give praise enough to Iona and all of her team at Munlochy Animal Aid for everything they do, it is incredibly humbling and long may our friendship continue.\"The total value of goods and cash donated by the end of August was pound,.Iona Nicol was delighted to show the visitors around and very grateful for the vital donations and support shown by members of the public.The centre, which faces signicant food and vets bills on a regular basis, marked its th anniversary in August.Friday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

She called for the creation of prearranged collections for businesses seeking to deposit large amounts of cash, after the review recognised that such arrangements could be improved.The MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch said: \"As the MSP for Beauly and Kyle, I am of course disappointed that the RBS branches in both towns are to close.\"While I recognise branch use has been declining in both of these areas, there are still well-documented and legitimate questions regarding security and disabled access in the alternative banking provision.\"The review plainly states that the branch closure in Beauly will cause dficulties for vulnerable customers and so as the constituency MSP I am calling on RBS to work with me to put measures in place to provide specic support for them. I hope RBS will work with me to listen to the views of the community council to ensure there are better routes and provision in the Beauly area.\"The union Unite slated the announcement by RBS, arguing that the bank had simply gone through the motions of reviewing the cases before pushing ahead with its original plans.The unionrsquos regional officer, Lyn Turner, said: \"The Johnston Carmichael review was entirely predictable and nothing but a rubber-stamp of RBS management decisions. Sixty communities out of an original  with branches earmarked for closure will now be marginalised by this so-called review. Unite will request to meet RBS urgently to discuss the impact.\"Simon Watson, managing director of personal banking at RBS pledged to provide banking alternatives in Kyle and Beauly.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact. World population is set to double in  years. Energy needs, food supply, pollution are all driven by human population density. It makes no odds how many windmills we build whatever their size! Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues. It is hard to take the Greens cranks, politicians and doom-mongers of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seriously when their reports fail to state, or take into account the blindingly obvious.David.

The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion.

But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League.

Added to this, a further four football pitches worth of the reserve land would be temporarily lost to the construction site to accommodate the construction activities and the associated diggers, cranes and other heavy machinery.\"But the effects of the road scheme on the reserves wildle will extend far beyond the extent of roadworks activities.\"The noise and activity associated with the A construction works, and the increased traffic flows and the imposing road structure once the road is completed, will cause many birds to keep their distance and not attempt to nest or feed within several hundred metres of the road site.\"Transport Scotland has bought land at Dellmore near Insh Marshes and proposes to convert some of this to wet grassland to accommodate the homeless wader bird species from Insh. While RSPB Scotland has welcomed this, the charity said it will be hard to convert this land for the waders, and maintain it as such over the long-term.The spokeswoman said: \"It is far from guaranteed it will provide suitable habitat, and evenit does, the new habitat will not be big enough or suitable to rehome all of the waders that would be made homeless. Neither will it address other harm to wildle.\"Karen Birkby, RSPB Scotlands site manager at Insh Marshes, said several suggestions made to Transport Scotland to minimise impact on the nature reserve have been ignored.Aviemore Community Council made similar claims last week that their concerns had fallen on stoney ground over plans to construction the dual carriageway on the village side of the current A as part of the Dalraddy-Slochd section. They said it will impact on the popular Milton Woods.Ms Birkby said: \"We have continually made the case for protecting the exceptional wildle of Insh Marshes, minimising harmful impacts, and maximising environmental benefits such as enhancing or providing suitable new habitat nearby.\"While we welcome the intention of converting some land at Dellmore to wet grassland, it is far from guaranteed that it will provide suitable habitat for all the wildle affected.\"We understand the need for the A dualling but believe that it can be built in a way which minimises its impact.\"We have suggested several ways in which Transport Scotland could do this but disappointingly, they are not proposing these measures in the latest plans, so there is a real risk that the road scheme will result in long-term harm to a iety of wildle.\"We encourage local people to view the proposals online or attend the public exhibition and raise their concerns before the deadline of October .\"The proposals for Crubenmore to Kincraig went on show yesterday in Newtonmore Village Hall.

Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”Cherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.Having battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”Despite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of LuckyBhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like LuckyBhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”Three days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday th June, -year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took  to  minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”After being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.Having served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”During his  years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was  — to take it easy, so we came home# We went to bed about  o’clock.”“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”Carol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled  and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently  public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than  across Skye.Ross Cowie said: “We always said at LuckyBhere thatwe could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills.

Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.#########################################-Article by Adam GordonAll images by Willie Urquhart."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/p1-crop.jpg","title":"council wants scotrail to help ease disruption on stromeferry","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineScotrail are currently considering a proposal to terminate rail journeys at Strathcarron to allow road traffic to flow more freely through the ersion on the Stromeferry bypass.At a meeting in Lochcarron last week, Colin Howell , Highland Council’s head of infrastructure, said that the ‘road to rail’ ersion on the bypass, where important stabilisation work to the rockface is being carried out, could stay open to traffic for an extra  minutes each dayScotrail would agree to do this. It would involved taking passengers by bus from Strathcarron to stations along the line to Kyle of Lochalsh.At the moment, even when a train has gone passed the bypass, that section of line must remain closed until the train reaches either Kyle or Strathcarron. Mr Howell said that Transport Scotland and Transport Minister Michael Matheson are considering this.A spokesman for Transport Scotland said Scotrail are looking at the proposal, which will have to be approved by the Mr Matheson. to facilitate the essential works on the Council’s A road.“We appreciate that, notwithstanding this cooperation, there is disruption for road uses during the passage of the normal train service. We have asked colleagues in the ScotRail Alliance to considerthere are any practical options further to minimise disruption to road users during the road works whilst still maintaining services upon which rail passengers depend.”Skye and Lochalsh MP Ian Blackford supported the introduction to the buses from Strathcarron.He added: “Network Rail seem to be sticking their fingers in their ears over this. A number of mistakes from both the rail company and Highland Council have led to the situation that we are in now and have been for some time.”“Network Rail must stop some of the trains coming from Inverness at Strathcarron and then arrange a bus service going onto Stromeferry. That would alleviate the ridiculous waiting times that passengers travelling by road are experiencing.”“The current way of working has caused no end of problems.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society. They are not republican demands and it is long past that the British Government stopped prioritising its own selfish interests over what should be birth-rights of people they claim to represent.What is certain is that Direct Rule failed in the past and is not and never will be acceptable again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27474  ","story":" Mark MoloneyMartin said that while a decision on a merger with the SDLP or contesting elections in the North has not yet been reached, there were no circumstances under which Fianna Fáil candidates would not take their seats.FIANNA Fáil leader Mícheál Martin TD has confirmed that successful Fianna Fáil candidates standing in the North would take their seats in Westminster.

Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8658944.1538772078!/image/image.jpg","title":"northern

mystied as to why the large street planters, bought at considerable cost to ratepayers, have vanished from the Ballymena townscap.Many members of the public have been contacting theto enquire what has happened the planters and whether they willto the streets.The large containers, which were added to the town centre as part of the poundmillion public realm scheme were initially the subject of public scorn but by early June many of them had been filled with blooms, adding some colour and vibrant appearance to the town.So, when the best of the planters with superb floral displays were taken away, virtually overnight, many locals were puzzled.However it must be admitted that some of the planters - originally dubbed ‘skips’ by local people, were in a poor state or repair.When thecontacted the Council to askthey were gone for good, they responded by saying the planters had been taken to a Council yard to be replanted, but will be ed to the town centre when this is complete.Eagle-eyed members of the public have also been asking why the planters had been moved from the original storage area at the site of the old Wellington Street church. Council simply said they are now being stored at a Council yard.Meanwhile people have also been concerned as to the whereabouts of the original town centre bandstand.The plan for this was for it to be re-established in the Peoples Park, however this has not yet happened.When thecontacted Council for a statement, they said: “We are delighted with the success to date of Harmony Hub – our borough’s newest and state-of-the-art outdoor entertainment venue.“Harmony Hub has showcased a wide range of talented local artists since it opened earlier this year and we look forward to welcoming more great performances and attractions.Speaking about the original bandstand, the Council confirmed they have plans for it.“The old bandstand was carefully dismantled so it can be preserved and relocated to the People’s Park.“We are currently working on plans for this installation and more information will be made available in due course.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1065046.jpg--.jpg?1538637007000\n","title":"tension in chamber over gaa dinner","story":"AN INVITE for councillors to a GAA gala dinner stoked up tensions in the Council chamber last week.A request from St Ergnats GAC to invite members of Mid and East Antrim to the Tullyglass on November  was read to members.It followed an item on the agenda with members being invited to a gala dinner in support of NI Childrens Hospice.Members had agreedthey were to attend the hospice dinner that they would purchase their own tickets.When the GAA dinner was raised Councillor Carson proposed to mark it as read as the club was not located in the Mid and East Antrim boundary lines.However Councillor Declan OLoan said the club was located in Moneyglass which fell very close to the border and that a lot of players at the club lived within the Mid and East Antrim Borough.He added: This is an outstanding club like many others in the area who raise a lot of money and doesnt depend on its council for support.I would propose we do the same for this as we are doing for the hospice.Councillor Gaston seconded Councillor Carsons proposal to mark the invitation as read.If anyone wishes to attend this they should go in their own capacity.Councillor Maguire added that the issue of location of the club should not come into the decision.He added: If I remember correctly some members of this Council attended a dinner in Lurgan or Portadown for the British Legion so that set a precedent.I would second what Councillor OLoan has said and treat this invite similar to that of the hospice dinner.Councillor Gaston added that both invitations were completely dferent.The Northern Ireland Hospice does sterling work and is for the benefit of people all over Northern Ireland. It is not just for a section of the community.Councillor Carsons proposal to mark the invite as read was carried with a vote of  in favour.The event is to mark the clubs th anniversary with special guests including champion jockey Tony McCoy.It will be held in the Tullyglass Hotel on November .

EasyJet pilot Alex Hawthorne who is originally from Waringstown Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels.    Alex began to pursue a career as a pilot when she moved to Canada They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain.    Alex with her grandparents in the cockpit “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.”\"  \"  Northern Irelands best fish and chip shop has been revealed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.   Alex giving her valedictorian speech at Oxford “A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8658944.1538772078!/image/image.jpg","title":"northern

A mother and grandmother, Cindy, who was just , has been described as an ‘inspirational’ figure both to her family, friends and those she mentored.   Cindy Greer Her son Aaron Greersaid: “My mum was the rock of the family. We all depended on her. “I think we all feel a bit lost right now. To have the person you have always depended upon taken away from you so suddenly, it is dficult to deal with. “She was the most amazing, inspirational person in my le. It is so hard to put into words what she meant to us. “This was always a happy house. I have such good memories because of mum. She brought all of us together. She has two grandchildren and loved them to pieces. The family was mum’s big love. Any excuse for a family gathering to bring us all together. Christmas dinner was always here with everyone around the table.”Her mum Joan Newell is simply heartbroken. She said she couldn’t imagine never seeing her eldest daughter Cindy again. “I just love her so much. She was always there for me and did whatever she could to make my le better.“She was such a rock in this family. She phoned me last Wednesday after she had been talking to Alan. I asked herwe would see her that night but she had a client coming and she would see me on Thursday afternoon. That was the last we spoke.“I was at a meeting in church on Wednesday night and a couple of people came in late and said there had been a terrible accident. I said ‘God help whoever it is’. Little did I know it was Cindy. I couldn’t take it in when I heard the news.”Her partner of  years Alan McIvor said she was coming from work last Wednesday and phoned him on her hands-free around pm to say she was leaving. “She asked how my day was and she was her usual cheery self.“She said to put the tea on, and I reckoned she would be home about .pm. Sadly she didn’t make it.”Her red Honda Civic had been involved in a collision with a van at around .pm.“Someone stopped at the scene and started CPR then Cindy was resuscitated by paramedics.

But the worst thing for a child is to lose a mother. There are no words good enough to describe the person my Mummy is or how I feel at this present moment. Even though her fabulous personality shone throughout every part of her and her le, I am going to miss the simple things like goodnight kisses, the constant ‘I love you millions my special girl’ and the hour long chats about our dreams. I am so so privileged to call her my mother and she made sure she gave all of us the most heart-warming special memories that will stay with us a letime.“Her smile, her laugh, her humour, her love will always be with me. I love you millions forever Mum.”Cindy’s sister Julie Newell said she was  years younger than her and for many years took on a motherly role. “That grew into a friendship, sister relationship which was amazing. She was my biggest support. She is the heart of this family. She was the boss as the oldest sister. She took all the decisions for mum and dad as their health isn’t great.”Cindy and her partner Alan had been together for  loving years. Alan firmly believes Cindy made him a better man. “She was a total and utter inspiration and has improved my le. She was just what I needed.“We met when we both worked for the First Trust Bank, although in dferent departments. We enjoyed such brilliant times together - so many things, holidays and weekends away that I have great memories of.“Over the last few days people have said to me that Cindy and I did more in the last  years than a lot of people have done in a letime.“We had outline plans for Cindy’s th birthday in a year and a half and that is something I will have to deal with.“It is absolutely devastating. She was my rock and inspiration to be a better person.” Cindy grew up in Gilford’s Barrack Hill and went to Craigavon Primary School in the town and on to Tandragee Junior High School.

Her other sister Tracy McConnell is involved in with a children’s missionary charity called Abaana based in Bangor. Through that charity, Cindy sponsored a little boy called George in Uganda.Cindy’s partner Alan said some of the family will be taking over this sponsorship and that is why the family feel it is appropriate that donations in lieu of flowers are to the Abaana charity c o Milne Funeral Services.The family have been overwhelmed by the huge support and love since Cindy passed away.Her son Aaron said the kindness of everyone has been ‘unbelievable’ with so many gts of flowers, food and cards.“We always knew mum was popular but didn’t realise just how many lives she had touched.“We now know how much she was loved by everyone around her and how much she loved us... we will always love her.”The family also want to thank the wider family circle and friends for their support and kindness, those who attended the accident scene for their assistance and medical intervention, the PSNI Liaison Officer who has been a tower of strength and support to them the ‘absolutely amazing’ hospital staff and consultants at the Royal Victoria Hospital and the funeral director for his compassion and professionalism.

The idea was hatched in December  by Prime Minister Terence O’Neill: “In that yearNorthern Ireland will celebrate its th anniversary –  years of challenge and dficulty and occasional disappointment, but also  years of splendid achievement, of growing prosperity, of expanding opportunity.”By the summer of , though, when the gates opened to the public, Terry was out on his ear, having been done for by a combination of opposition by UUP hardliners to his limited programme of civil rights reforms and a series of UVF bomb attacks on Belfast’s water supply. He jacked it in in April  and in an interview a month later he revealed the depth of his passion for reform: “It is frightfully hard to explain to Protestants thatyou give Roman Catholics a good job and a good house they will live like Protestants because they will see neighbours with cars and television sets they will refuse to have eighteen children. Buta Roman Catholic is jobless and lives in the most ghastly hovel he will rear eighteen children on National Assistance. If you treat Roman Catholics with due consideration and kindness they will live like Protestants in spite of the authoritative nature of their Church.”Ulster ’ cracked on regardless, although the loss of a man so imbued with the spirit of egalitarianism must have been a crushing blow. An expectant public surged through the gates when the exhibition opened in May for a five month .Looking back at the photographic and filmic evidence that survives, it’s clear that the attractions on the site were, ah, modest, to say the least. Let’s see now… there was a big, multi-coloured plastic model of the Giant’s Causeway over the door of the main indoor space there was, um, a model of a Shorts plane hanging overhead there were fairground ridesthere was a disco with go-go girls a £m satellite was launched containing a message of peace from Ulster to any le forms who may happen across it. .By far the most exciting thing to happen during Ulster ’ was the introduction of internment, which wasn’t technically part of the show although doubtless it was wildly popular with a fair percentage of Ulster ’ attendees and organisers.The last bit of air went out of the balloon when it was finally decided that there would be no royal visit because the safety of the afore-mentioned Saxe-Coburg von Gothas could not be guaranteed.As for posterity, the BBC – normally an enthusiastic booster of Our Wee Country – reported in an article in : “The official government report did not describe it as a success and ultimately it is remembered as a bland effort in self-promotion for a state that was teetering on the brink of implosion.”Which brings us back to Gammonfest – sorry, the Festival of GB and THP. What’s that going to look like on this side of the Irish Sea border in four years time  Well, flags, of course – there’ll be plenty of those. But then there always is, so Ulster’s going to have to do a bit of thinking outside the box here. Marches – ditto. Bonfires – ditto. What about a festival, then  One with a funfair and the Giant’s Causeway and.. and.. never mind, you get the idea. We could call it Ulster ’. Or Catch . Which might make a bit more sense."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"johnnies havent missed the boat insists mcnulty","story":"ST JOHN’S and Cushendall lock horns again this Sunday at Ballycastle two weeks on from their thrilling drawn semi-final in Dunloy.Cushendall battled back from being five points down in the closing stages to take the lead following a late free from Neil McManus. Yet, Ciaran Johnston had the final say on proceedings to nail a free under intense pressure and in the face of a strong cross-field wind. As the underdogs, some may feel that St John’s had their chance the first day as favourites have a habit of winning replays. However, St John’s manager Tony McNulty sees it dferently and has urged his side to make to most of Sunday’s second chance to reach the county final. “We just took our foot of the pedal in the last few minutes. I said before the game that we had to play for  or  minutes and we only played for  minutes,” said McNulty. “We were four or five points ahead late on and we just switched off. “We switched off long enough for them to get their goal and it was nervous at the end. While we scored to draw the game, we felt we had done enough to win the game. “We’ll not be going into this match thinking we’ve missed the boat. “When Neil McManus hit that free I though “here we go again” – thankfully Ciaran Johnston stepped up and scored his free. We were disappointed having led not to hold on.“We can’t afford to switch off again – Cushendall are too good. When you have players like Neil McManus, Arron Graffin and Alex Delargy, we can’t afford to. I can’t see there being much in the game again this Sunday.” McNulty also gave his views on the worrying scenes which marred the end of the match when two Cushendall supporters jumped over the wire at Dunloy to confront the St John’s players in the dying minutes of the game. With such incidents in the spotlight in recent weeks, the intruders could have sparked a much more serious flashpoint, but order was soon restored. While McNulty condemned the actions of those involved, he feared the game might have been brought to a premature end with his side one point in arrears at the time. “There was a bit of carryon at the sideline which had nothing to do with us,” reflected McNulty “The ball was in among four or five Cushendall men and one of their players pulled on it.“He hit his own player and one of our players. It resulted in a bit of pushing – nothing serious. “Two of their supporters jumped over the wire. “I don’t know why, but they started throwing punches until the players got them off the pitch. “I was glad the referee continued the game and gave us the chance to equalise and thankfully the people were identied.” It is believed that the Cushendall player who was struck by his own teammate was Antrim ace Eoghan Campbell, who is likely to miss Sunday’s replay as a result of the hand injury sustained late in the drawn encounter. St John’s will also be without one of their leading players for the remainder of the campaign after attacker Donal Carson departed for Australia last week, but Simon McCrory is expected to be fit to play a greater role in the replay having played the second half in the drawn game. “Donalis away to Australia so that’s a big blow for us,” added McNulty. “I don’t know what happened, but there was something about the dates and he couldn’t get them changed. “It is unfortunate because he has been playing well for us. “In nearly every game, he has scored a goal for us. If Campbell is out for them, it evens things up a bit. “Simon McCrory should be good to go. He is a super player for us and he has been outstanding in every game he has played this year. He wasn’t right for the last game. All being well, the two-week break will do him good.” McNulty will also have the task of lting the dual players in the club following their semi-final football defeat at the hands of Creggan last Sunday. Senior finalists in , the Johnnies were edged out - to - by Kevin Madden’s men at Glenavy, but McNulty, whose son Ryan is a key member of both squads, doesn’t think the dual players will suffer any hangover from that defeat. “We are disappointed, but we have to hang in,” stated the Johnnies boss. “We didn’t play as well as we can do on Sunday, so we can have no complaints. “Things conspired against us on the day. Simon McDonagh’s we went into labour on Sunday morning so he was unavailable. Peter McCallin wasn’t back from holiday in time. “We had six or seven dual players in action on Sunday who will feature again this weekend. “They’ll lt themselves up alright. “It would have been great to going into the match trying to reach two senior finals, but we have to focus on Sunday’s game now.” With Division One winners and  champions Dunloy out following their surprise loss to Loughgiel, the remaining sides will all fancy their chances of lting the Volunteer Cup later this month. The Shamrocks will get a chance to view their final opponents over the course of  minutes in Ballycastle on Sunday, but it would come as no great surprisean additional  minutes was required to separate St John’s and Cushendall."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"roisins relief as decision to deny pip is overturned","story":"THE delighted father of West Belfast woman Roisin McWilliams has spoken of his relief after his daughter’s PIP knockback was overturned.Last month the Andersonstown News spoke with Tom McWilliams in his Twinbrook home as he told us the heartbreaking story of his -year-old daughter’s courageous battle with stage  Hodgkin#s lymphoma and how the mother of one was refused PIP on the grounds that she could cook for herself, administer her own medication and plan a journey.An emotional Tom said yesterday: “It was such a relief to us as a family to find out that Roisin’s PIP decision had been overturned and she would also be awarded money owed, this has taken a lot of pressure off her and we can now focus on the future and getting her well again.”Last week Roisin also got more news she was waiting for – funding for her new immune therapy treatment has been granted and she underwent her first session in recent days.Tom said: “I have no doubt that the media pressure surrounding Roisin’s case has helped and I want to thank each and every single person who has taken the time to wish us well and support us.

Bredagh had other ideas and points from the towering Niall McFarland and Joe Hanrahan suddenly had their side in front.Gerard Quinn fired over the equalising score in the fth minute, but it was all down hill after this for Ballycran as they were put under the cosh by a blistering Bredagh attack.Unanswered points from Hanrahan, Sean Hughes and the fleet-footed Ronan Costello had Bredagh - to - in front after  minutes. It got an awful lot worse for a wasteful Ballycran when Hughes drilled the sliotar to the back of the net after a defence-splitting run from Matt McAreavey.Costelloand Hughes rubbed salt into Ballycranrsquos wounds as gave Bredagh a commanding - to - lead by the nd minute.Ballycran were then thrown a leline when Stuart Martin ended a piercing run with a clinical finish to leave seven points in it with seven minutes of the half remaining.Alas, Ballycran were unable to push on from here and Bredagh punished them on the break with points from Costelloand Hughes to take a - to - lead as the break approached.Martin and McFarland swapped points before Ballycranrsquos task got even harder when star midfielder Phelim Savage, who was part of the clubrsquos senior team who lted the SHC title in Ballygalet last Sunday, was harshly red-carded leaving his side to play the entire second half with only  men.It all could have been so dferent for Ballycran at the end of the first half. They shot seven wides, had a strong penalty appeal turned down and arasping shot from Gerard Quinn rattled against the crossbar and flew to safety.An early point at the start of the second half from Ballycranrsquos Francis Caldwell was cancelled out by Hughes before Martin and P J Lavery did likewise. Costello edged Bredagh into a - to - lead after  minutes, but a battling Ballycran took the next three points from Francis Caldwelland Liam McCarthy.Bredagh halted Ballycranrsquos momentum with a point from Hughes before McCarthy cancelled his score out with another free.Costello and Joe Blaney extended Bredaghrsquos lead to  points before Caldwell kept Ballycran ticking over with a point from play as his team-mates went for goal.Three Costello points in quick succession had Bredagh in wonderland before Caldwell converted a free in the th minute to make it a - to - game. Naturally, Ballycran continued to go for goals, but Bredagh were not for conceding anything and late points from Costello and Jacob McDonnell gave then a resounding win.Bredagh: Odhran Davies, Aaron Patterson, Tiarnan Sheehan, Evin Maguire, Aodhan OrsquoKeefe, Niall McFarland , Liam Hogan, Matt McAreavey, Joe Hanrahan , Dara Curran, Sean Hughes , Joe Blaney , Ciaran McMullan, Ronan Costello , Enda Gargan.

Last Wednesday nightrsquos attack on St Patrickrsquos Primary School has been equally disturbing to police, who feel that a new wave of criminology seems to be underway.This time they witnessed the destruction of the schoolrsquos tuck shop which had just been stocked up with almost pound worth of stock. Everything was scattered round the hall and even on to the adjoining football field. Fire extinguishers were turned on and directed at tape recorders, which were destroyed.Police are treating the crime seriously and have appealed to for any information to help them in their inquiries. Fingerprints have been taken.This latest wave of school destruction is already being regarded as monstrous in terms of the community. No-one, it seems, saw anything, but this could be indicative of the public turning their back, lest they should suffer recriminations.Brother Otteran, headmaster at St Patrickrsquos, was abhorred at the destruction. He permitted a Down Recorder photographer to visit the scene and had no objections to the crime being publicised.HOLLYWOOD mdash The widely-held belief that Hollywood actress Greer Garson was born and bred in Down District has been scotched.

It is turning into death-trap with dficult turning circles that intrude on pedestrians and oncoming traffic, she explained.ldquoThe meeting with roads officials took place at .am so they were able to see the situation for themselves with everybody having to demonstrate nimble footwork, ing out of the way of oncoming traffic.Cllr Enright said the pavement currently ran only half way up Racecourse Hill and the road was not wide enough for two-way traffic.ldquoRoads officials have agreed to a one-way system which will allow vehicles to drive down the hill when a new pavement is in place. Traffic calming measures will also be provided to ensure vehicles do not race down the hill.

It is for this reason I am delighted with the recent decision of Newry, Mourne and Down Council to endorse and back my call for a peoplersquos vote on Brexit.Across the UK, more and more people are asking for this vote to have the opportunity to pass their final judgement on what will define us for generations to come. Brexit will affect everyone and we should be looking at the detail and allowing everyone the right to have their say.This is not only a moment for those of us who voted to remain, but also the growing number of people who voted to leave and now see the ramications of Brexit will be so widespread.Northern Ireland only works when based on sharing and interdependence, yet Brexit entails new isions, barriers and friction. We can stop those isions by supporting political stability and protecting the Good Friday Agreement, maintaining open borders throughout these islands and protecting our economy and enabling future opportunities.This is not about overturning democracy. Indeed, nothing is more democratic than allowing people to have their say. Democracy cannot be overturned by applying more democracy.Rather than answering a question, more questions can often emerge at the result of an election. This is the case with the EU Referendum of . Since the end of the Second World War, we have had four sets of general elections which have occurred within two years of each other. I doubt anyone would argue these elections occurring in any way subverted the democratic process.We are witnessing almost daily the complexities of interdependence, which we benefit from, that have developed between member nations of the EU. These complexities were brushed aside by many of the leave side as unnecessary and easy to re-establish on better terms. Yet, with six months to go, these same leavers have not managed to propose anything which has come close to a pragmatic workable solution. For these leavers to now claim to speak on behalf of the lsquowill of the peoplersquo is a hood.This leads to bad politics and bad democracy through containing the lsquowill of the peoplersquo to a one-time snapshot within history. This precludes the people from quite simply changing their mind. Just as a healthy democracy requires constant checks and restraints placed upon the government of the day, departure from the EU should require the continuing consent of the people.We are without an Executive, and thus without a voice, in what is the most tumultuous constitutional period in generations. Our preparation for leaving the EU is based upon a two-page letter written over two years ago and being carried out by civil servants.This is a complete abdication of responsibility and the duty of governance by those elected to lead this society. Instead, our politicians have retreated into the safe confines of their own ideology, rather than search for a consensus which is best for the country.It is time for the people to take back control. What we have seen is an abject failure of politicians to lead in the face of this crisis. Instead, they have retreated into the confines of their own ideology rather than search for a consensus within the country. That extends not only from Westminster, but also closer to home.Only a peoplersquos vote can begin the untying of this Gordian knot.bull The South Down Alliance Party is organising a Brexit  discussion in the Newcastle Centre on Thursday, October , between pm and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Response times not what we wish%2C says ambulance chief  ","story":"NORTHERN Irelandrsquos most senior ambulance official has conceded that the local community has not been receiving the emergency response that it deserves.The admission from Ambulance Service chief executive Michael Bloomfield came during a public meeting in Downpatrick on Monday night organised by the Down Community Health Committee.However, Mr Bloomfield hopes the service will improve when proposed changes to how the organisation responds to calls are implemented.A review of current despatch procedures has resulted in the development of proposals mdash currently out to public consultation ndash which aim to provide the most immediate and appropriate clinical response to the most seriously ill or injured.Mr Bloomfield insisted the proposed changes to the way all calls are categorised were not a cost cutting exercise and nothing to do with achieving targets. He said the main thrust was to provide a safer, quality service.The chief executive revealed that implementing the new model will require the recruitment of an additional  frontline ambulance staff over the next three to five years and cost in the region of poundm.ldquoOur firm view is that the proposed changes will provide a better quality and safer service and go a long way to meeting the challenge in providing an effective response times to communities such as the one in this area which has not been getting the sort of response that we would wish, said Mr Bloomfield, who viewed Mondayrsquos meeting as the first in a series as part of the organisationrsquos consultation on how it aims to improve services for patients.He continued: ldquoResponse times in this area are challenging, but not particularly dferent to other areas. I have been so impressed at the commitment, dedication and professionalism of our staff to provide the high quality of response that they do in all communities. Without doubt, we only have the quality service we currently have as a result of the huge efforts staff go to.ldquoI have met staff in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch and the efforts and dedication staff go to to provide the best response they can is humbling and I am proud to lead the organisation, but it is not sustainable. The level of effort that staff are required to put in on a constant basis is not reasonable and not fair to continue to expect it.Mr Bloomfield said that while ambulance staff always put the needs of the public first, that level of effort and commitment on an ongoing basis against a rising demand was ldquosimply not sustainable.He said the organisation received around , calls a year, equating to a  per cent increase on the number since  . Mr Bloomfield said the huge increase was ldquoway above what was typical in any other service and while the number of calls had increased, the organisationrsquos resources had remained relatively static.Turning to ambulance response times, Mr Bloomfield said a government target required the organisation to respond to .% of le threatening calls within eight minutes. He explained that while this was achieved in   when the rate was actually .%, that has reduced over the years.In the last financial year, the Ambulance Service responded to % of le threatening calls within eight minutes, with the figures for East Down just % with patients waiting up to  minutes for an emergency ambulance. Mr Bloomfield conceded this was ldquoclearly much more than the eight minute target.The chief executive said the organisation was proposing a new way of categorising and prioritising calls.Currently, calls that come through are categorised as immediately le threatening that require an eight minute response, based on a model which has been in place since , he excplained.ldquoThere have been no changes since and we are trying to respond to % of all the calls we receive in eight minutes. What staff tell us is that when they go to many of those calls that have been categorised as immediately le threatening, they discover they are not and many may not even be urgent, Mr Bloomfield continued.ldquoResearch also suggests that closer to seven per cent of all calls are truly le threatening where time is so important that we need to get there quickly.The chief executive said the organisation wanted to introduce a more sophisticated way of answering calls by talking a little bit longer to ask more questions about the patientrsquos condition to be able to more accurately determine what is their real need.Mr Bloomfield said this will allow the organisation to make sure people who require a response within eight minutes are dealt with appropriately.He said the proposed changes were about assessing a patientrsquos needs more accurately, based on their clinical indication and despatching the right vehicle.The chief executive also pointed to frustration at turnaround times for ambulance crews when they transfer patients to hospitals outside the district, particularly to the Ulster in Dundonald. He said crews ldquodid not want to be standing around AE departments waiting they want to be out providing care to patients.He added: ldquoI can understand there may be a view that the proposals are about changing the way calls are categorised in order to change targets or, even worse, that this may be seen as some sort of cost cutting measure.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It has been thought until now that the scheme had been largely fixed in November  and the RHI Inquiry has spent much of its time examining the allegation that DUP figures delayed those changes, allowing hundreds of people to pile into the scheme.However, yesterday the inquiry was told that evidence from the Department for the Economy shows that although the  changes had improved the scheme, they did far less to protect public money than had been previously thought.The  changes introduced tiered tarfs which meant that after a boiler ran for , hours the subsidy level dropped massively - something which ended the unlimited ‘burn to earn’ situation which existed before then.However, they did not involve a more complex cost control known as degression, which operated in the GB scheme.And alongside the move to tiering Stormont also doubled the size of boiler eligible for the most lucrative tarf.That meant that claimants under the revised scheme installed far bigger boilers so that they were able to produce considerable heat and be paid at the highest subsidy level.Figures provided to the inquiry show that boilers were on average running for % of the time before the changes. But after the change, usage - albeit with boilers able to produce double the heat in the same time - dropped to %, the level at which the most lucrative tarf dropped.However, counsel for the inquiry David Scoffield QC said that payments made per unit of heat had dropped only marginally from .p to .p.Dr McCormick agreed that the changes had proved to be a limited budgetary control, although he said that they had at least “stopped the unlimited use” of boilers.He said that the decision to double the size of boilers for the most lucrative tarf at the same time as attempting to rein in the scheme “was not as clearly analysed and scrutinised as it should have been”.He accepted that the failure to understand that the scheme was still very generous gave a  sense of security that spending on the scheme was under control and “the worst of it is dealt with”, but that now seemed “very questionable indeed”. produced the email to Timothy Johnston \"   produced the email to Timothy Johnston \"  RHI Inquiry: Mystery over DUP Spads’ emailSammy Wilson: DUP is not bluffing over threat to Theresa May Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Dr McCormick also accepted that a power to suspend the scheme should have been included in , something which would have stopped the second spike in applications.Dr Keith MacLean put it to him that although the introduction of tiered tarfs had addressed the issue of wasteful heat, “the heat that is being produced is costing the taxpayer pretty much the same that it did before”.Dr MacLean went on to say that the department’s business case which argued that the scheme was value for money in an attempt to retrospectively get approval for irregular spending on the scheme “seems to have been a work of complete fiction”.try catch     .               ..

email to Timothy Johnston  Last Thursday, counsel for the inquiry Donal Lunny told an evidence session at which Mr Johnston was testying that late the previous night the inquiry had been given an email by another former DUP Spad, Timothy Cairns, which showed signicant contact between them on RHI.The email appears to have been supplied because it contained a reference to another green energy scheme, the NIRO, which the inquiry had belatedly requested DUP Spads search their email accounts for references to.However, the email also contained a reference to “renewable heat”, meaning thatit was in the possession of either the DUP, Mr Johnston or Mr Cairns prior to that point it ought to have been disclosed.The inquiry has now published the email, showing that it was sent from Mr Cairns’s DUP.org.uk email address to Mr Johnston – who has told the inquiry that he also used an email address on the DUP server, rather than a departmental email, for government business.If the email remains on the DUP server, that would mean that the party should have disclosed it, evenneither of the two men now have access to it.The News Letter asked the DUP why it had not handed over the email before nowit was in the party’s possession, whether the party had establishedit had other material that may not have been handed over and who within the party had been responsible for giving documents to the inquiry. The party declined to comment, saying that the inquiry was still in process.Mr Cairns, who no longer works for the party, was asked why he was only submitting the email now and whether he was aware of the party having access to his old emails.He said: “I have been advised by my solicitor to respond as follows: The inquiry process is ongoing. Until the inquiry has concluded I do not feel in a position to assist at this stage. This is out of respect for the inquiry process.”RHI cost controls did less to save money than previously thought Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Included in the top grades were twins Arianne and Enyala Banks, who both matched each otherrsquos results. The sisters achieved  A* grades and a distinction in additional mathematics each.Year  tutor, Amy Bates, said ldquoIt is a delight to see the hard work of the pupils and support given by parents and staff being rewarded with so many students achieving their potential and obtaining high grades.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

High winds toppled trees and power lines.President Donald Trump announced plans to visit Florida and hard-hit Georgia early next week but did not say what day he would arrive.ldquoWe are with you! he tweeted.People have no idea how hard Hurricane Michael has hit the great state of Georgia.

Similar scenes played out in parts of Virginia as the storm raced seawards.Boats lay among the debris from homes destroyed by Hurricane Michael Meanwhile, thousands of National Guard troops, law enforcement officers and rescue teams still had much to do in the hardest hit area: Floridarsquos Panhandle.Families living along the Panhandle are now faced with a struggle to survive in a perilous landscape of shattered homes and shopping centres, the storm debris spread far and wide.In one community, Panama City, most homes were still standing, but no property was left undamaged. Downed power lines and twisted street signs lay all around.Aluminium siding was shredded and homes were split by fallen trees. Hundreds of cars had broken windows.The hurricane damaged hospitals and nursing homes in Panama City, and officials worked to evacuate hundreds of patients.Florida governor Rick Scott, called it ldquounimaginable destruction and said: ldquoSo many lives have been changed forever. So many families have lost everything.We are working aggressively to get supplies to families in need.

This is an unprecedented and overwhelming vote that demonstrates the strength of this workforce’s determination to secure the Living Wage Foundation’s minimal pay baseline for decency.“The workforce ask only that Glen Dimplex pay the living wage which is set at £. and as a minimum keep pace with the rates set going forward. Our members have voted to raise themselves out of poverty pay permanently they are determined that they will not be just another ‘in-work poverty’ statistic. These are hard working production workers who manufacture domestic heating equipment - surely they deserve better than poverty pay Pointing to the company’s profitability, Ms Fitzgerald said that bosses had nowhere to hide when it came to meeting the workers’ legitimate pay demand.“The Glen Dimplex group is a highly successful global business. Their last accounts published showed an annual turnover of just below a billion euro, with profits for the year of € million and accumulated profits of €. While the bosses claim they can’t afford to pay a Living Wage to those who produce that wealth day and daily, they managed to find € million to pay a idend to shareholders for the year.“I will be meeting with union reps in the workplace to agree strike dates as part of a roll-out strategy for the industrial action. I call on the bosses to address our members’ legitimate and very modest pay expectations in order to avoid an unnecessary and disruptive industrial dispute”, Ms Fitzgerald finished.When contacted Glen Dimplex said there was no one available to comment.Tributes paid following death of ‘legend’ Tom ClarkeTV: how many young people were caught without a TV Licence in your area  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

A company linked to Newry man Brian McConville, who runs the successful MJM Group, has submitted plans for the extension and refurbishment of  –  Donegall Square East. The works include a new extension, with plans for commercial use at the basement, ground floor and four floors, and office accommodation on the first to third, fth and sixth. A design statement from architects Hamilton says the design intention is “to remove any unsympathetic additions and alterations within the listed buildings, retain the original plan form of the buildings, and conserve all extant historic features”. That includes ornate cornices, ceiling roses and moulded timbers “all of which survive in relatively good condition throughout the building”. The design document says the “new work within the historic structure will follow conservation principles of maximum retention of historic fabric, minimum intervention, reversibility, honest, clarity and sustainability”. Brian McConville’s MJM Group is one of Northern Ireland’s fastest growing companies. MJM Marine is MJM Group’s main business, based in Newry, and headed by founder Brian McConville. It was set up in  by Mr McConville, and carries out work for many of the world’s top cruise liners, including Star Cruises.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam.

I grew up in an era where comedians actually had the benefit of free speech and you simply switched off or walked outyou didn’t find them funny. Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients. It would be really nicefor once our politicians could simply deliver us a viable business oriented solution that made le easier rather than the constant uncertainty we face. Imagine business owners delightthe punchline to the gag was “went to the pub and agreed a workable plan”. Now that would make me smile.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
