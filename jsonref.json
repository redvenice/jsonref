That came on top of the £1.2 million he donated to the party in 2017.A party source said: ‘If we don’t get a serious injection of money soon we will be in trouble.            The former Foreign Secretary’s surge in the leadership race has led to a ‘stampede’ by the party’s donors to switch money from Mrs May’s operation to Mr Johnson’s campaignNot only is it demoralising – it also means we can’t fund the work we need to do to prepare for a General Election.’Meanwhile, in a further boost for Mr Johnson, former PM Sir John Major will tomorrow lead a major Tory charge on climate change, joining the One Nation group of party moderates to demand that climate change is given the same level of concern as counter terrorism.A source said: ‘Boris will have no problem in jumping on all that, and it should give some moderates the fig leaf they need to climb down in their opposition to him’.The boost to Mr Johnson’s poll ratings – which started after Mrs May failed to deliver Brexit – has rattled his rivals, who include former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt. One Minister backing Mr Johnson told The Mail on Sunday: ‘We only have one candidate that can make Nigel Farage look like a pound-shop, snake-oil salesman and as the referendum showed, that is Boris whether you agree with him or not.’ The Minister branded critics of Mr Johnson a ‘cadre of entitled p***** who think they are born to rule’ but ‘were the ones that got us into this mess in the first place’.

Now times that by a billion and that’s where Gove is with the teachers, and slightly unfairly Jeremy is with the NHS.’But allies of Mr Gove hit back to claim he is garnering support across the Conservative Party from bother Leavers and Remainers.On Tuesday night he hosted 50 MPs for dinner at a pub in Chelsea, and pitched his unity vision over burgers and fish and chips. Mr Gove did not explicitly say he was running but set a vision of ‘protecting the union and trashing Corbyn every week, while also renewing the party intellectually whilst in government’. An MP in attendance told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It went down very well, there was a good mix as well. For someone not officially declared, he had a hell of a lot of support.’Official figures put Mr Raab top of the leadership money league, with £127,305 raised since January 1. Mr Johnson has received £80,250, thanks to donations from JCB chairman Lord Bamford and hedge-fund manager Johan Christofferson, but promises of more money for Mr Johnson are said to have ‘flooded in’ in recent days.

Astronauts discovered that four positions were possible without ‘mechanical assistance’ while six others involved the couple attaching themselves with an elastic belt or an inflatable tube that pressed them together. The document turned out to be a fake.In 1999, pornographic films called The Uranus Experiment included ‘microgravity’ sex scenes allegedly filmed on the ‘Vomit Comet’ plane used to simulate weightlessness.           Sex in space may seem a daft fixation of movie producers, but it is a serious subject for scientists. Above: Jane Fonda in BarbarellaThe films were fakes — clearly so because an actress’s ponytail hung down her back when it should have been floating.The truth is that having sex in zero-gravity takes a lot of hard work. ‘The No 1 enemy of sex in space is Sir Isaac Newton’s laws of motion,’ says physicist Michio Kaku. ‘It’s the third law — for every action there’s an equal and opposite reaction. If you push against something, it pushes back against you.’Kira Bacal, a Nasa clinical consultant who has researched sex in space, says: ‘If you’re trying something that involves force against the other person, it takes a lot of strength to hold you together.’So the slightest nudge from a partner can send the other person reeling across the cabin. Experts believe at least one partner would need to be anchored. Some have even suggested that a third person could help hold a pair together.Harry Stine, a former Nasa technician, claimed that the agency had simulated sex in space and concluded that the assistance of a third person would be the best technique.           If mankind is to survive should the Earth become uninhabitable, people may either have to live in space or colonise other planets. Above: Fonda and John Phillip Law in the 1968 filmIn practice, though, even staying together long enough to exchange a kiss is difficult in zero gravity. Vanna Bonta, an author and inventor, discovered this while flying with her husband on G-Force One, a modified Boeing 727 that produces the effect of weightlessness.She designed the ‘2suit’, which has velcro flaps that open at the groin and could be stuck to another similarly-opened suit for intimacy.And then there are the physical limitations. In zero-gravity, the human body becomes lazier. The heart doesn’t have to pump blood as vigorously so it shrinks. Muscles don’t have to work as hard either. Sudden exertion — such as sex — would thus be especially tiring.There is also the problem of sweat, which collects in layers on the skin or floats around the cabin without gravity working on it.Dr James Logan, a former Nasa chief doctor, says: ‘Sex in zero-g is going to have to be more or less choreographed, otherwise it’s just going to be a wild flail.’           If men and women wanted to sow the seeds of humanity’s future, then they would have to procreate in a weightless atmosphereAs for sex drive, male testosterone levels drop in zero gravity. And the high-energy radiation in space may cause sterility and birth defects.Finally, scientists point out that blood flows differently through the body in space — generally rising to the head and chest — so men may have trouble getting aroused.But anecdotal evidence suggests that, if anything, sex drive rises in space. Astronaut Mike Mullane says he had a persistent and painful condition when he woke up that he called the ‘Viagra effect’.Zero gravity does have one bonus, at least — it makes people look more attractive. Faces look more flushed and wrinkle-free, women’s breasts get larger and legs look more toned.On a psychological level, experts warn that sex in space could raise tension among a crew already living — metaphorically — on top of one another other. What might happen during a mission across the solar system if two of the three-man crew disappeared to canoodle at every opportunity?So the riddle of how to have sex in space is more likely to be solved by the private space tourism industry, whose companies are racing each other into space and are anxious to give their high-paying customers whatever they want.Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic reports it has had inquiries from people wanting to have their honeymoons in space, including consummating the marriage. The company says it isn’t planning to offer that opportunity until it understands the risks.However, space architects are already working on honeymoon suites on orbiting pleasure palaces that allow sex in sleeping bag-like ‘snuggle tunnels’ or swimming in giant floating water globes, a sort of zero-gravity hot-tub where the water is kept in place by airflow.All this would give new meaning to the question: ‘Did the Earth move for you, darling?’ But then the respondent might be too shattered to reply."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3897641.1558295307!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar says cost of bringing all homes up to energy efficiency 50bn","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRegarding climate change Leo Varadkar acknowledged there was “lots to be worried about” but added that there will also be “lots of opportunities”.It will cost €50 billion to bring all homes in Ireland up to the required energy efficient standard and a further €30 billion to phase out petrol and diesel cars, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said.Such changes can only be made over time and the Government can help with the cost, the Taoiseach said, but he added that people will have to take responsibility to upgrade their homes and change their cars.Mr Varadkar was speaking while campaigning in Mullingar, Co Westmeath, with Maria Walsh, a Fine Gael candidate for the European Parliament in the Midlands North West constituency.He was asked about the proposals contained in a draft of the “All of Government Plan to Tackle Climate Disruption” to be launched by Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton in the coming weeks. The  reported on Saturday that the draft contained proposals to increase the energy efficiency of homes, such as banning the installation of oil and gas boilers and potentially beginning a process to phase out the use of fossil fuel heating systems in all homes within six years, among many others measures. A change to building regulations would compel all homes undergoing a “major renovation” to bring the rest of the structure up to a minimum BER B2 rating.RetrofittingBy 2030, the draft plan – which is dated from last month and which is understood to be not yet finalised – is targeting the retrofitting of 500,000 domestic homes, the installation of 625,000 heat pumps in buildings, having 700,000 electrical vehicles on the road and having 10 per cent of Ireland’s heat supplied via district heating in cities.These changes will “potentially” increase the cost of both building and buying houses, Mr Varadkar acknowledged, but he added that “you have to think of the opportunity too”.“All of us spend an absolute fortune heating our homes. Just think of the amount of money you spend in a lifetime heating your home. If we build energy-efficient buildings, near-zero energy buildings, the actual savings over a lifetime are much greater than the cost of insulating your home or building it right in the first place. That’s a challenge and again a real risk but also a big opportunity.”When it comes to funding the changes needed to reduce our carbon emissions, he said the Government needed “to be honest with people”.“The cost of retrofitting and insulating all of our homes in Ireland is about €50 billion. No government of any colour or any party would be able to find that kind of money, even over 10 years, and the cost of changing all of our cars from petrol and diesel to electric again another €20 billion or €30 billion. It’s a huge amount of money and it can only be done over time and government can help with the cost but ultimately the responsibility will fall on iniduals over time to change their cars to change their vehicles to upgrade their homes.”Climate changeMr Varadkar said that the general public wants the Government to take further action on the issue of climate change. There was “lots to be worried about” but there will also be “lots of opportunities”.He said that while “people tend to focus on dire predictions and doom”, introducing policies to tackle the effects of climate change will lead to new economic opportunities also.“Just take the energy space, for example. We spend billions of euro importing oil and gas from other countries. If we double our renewable electricity production from 30 per cent to 70 per cent, not only will we cut down on imports from other countries, we’ll also create lots of jobs in the energy sector here in Ireland. I’d like to talk a little bit more in future about the opportunities that will arise from climate changes.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"One Eastern European man in mid-40s was arrested by garda\u0026iacuteHundreds attend memorial service for Leaving Cert student (18) stabbed in DublinMountaineering expert says recovery operation for S\u0026eacuteamus Lawless would be a \u0026lsquohuge task\u0026rsquoIt will take a further \u0026euro30bn to phase out petrol and diesel cars, adds TaoiseachGathering in Co Wicklow discusses challenges of reducing greenhouse gas emissionsPair had been stranded by rising sea tide while out walkingIncreased demand for architects and property, quantity and building surveyorsMusician had previously been in a relationship with model Alli MacDonnell who died earlier this yearTaoiseach attends National Famine Commemoration in SligoT\u0026aacutenaiste says there was \u0026lsquocertainly no row over Doonbeg versus other locations\u0026rsquoResearchers call for volunteer ers and snorklers to check entire island for CuvieIrish political parties work together while UK parties are \u0026lsquounable to agree on anything\u0026rsquoJudge said the girl was left \u0026lsquodevastated\u0026rsquo after birth mother said her father died of a broken heart due to girl\u0026rsquos refusal to visit the familyFarming practices and urbanisation have placed insect world in acute danger, says president ahead of World Bee DaySocial Democrats launch disability manifesto as candidate highlights library inaccessibilityIf you are unsure about your course choice you still have time to amend your selectionBrian Mooney on how to approach the CAO process and get your course choice rightHe pleaded with those asked by French authorities to travel to France to testify at trial next week of Ian Bailey to do soDr Diarmuid Martin said he has been shocked and saddened by recent stabbing incidents involving young peoplePolice charge them with burglary at ATMs in counties Antrim and Down"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3897468.1558279359!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk s inability to get past party politics extraordinary says coveney","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSimon Coveney: Ireland has to keep planning for the possibility that the UK will crash out of the European Union. Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA WireThe inability of the British political system to see above party politics in relation to Brexit is “extraordinary”, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.Ireland has to keep planning for the possibility that the UK will crash out of the European Union, he said.The talks between the Conservative and Labour parties, which ended without success on Friday, had been a “real and genuine effort” to find an accommodation on Brexit, but had failed on a number of key issues.One of these was the idea of a so-called people’s vote, or second referendum, which was something he did not think the Conservative Party can, or will be, in a position to offer.In Ireland, he said, the two main political parties work together on Brexit, as do Sinn Féin and the Green Party, but in the UK the two main parties “seem to be unable to agree on anything”.The more the British prime minister, Theresa May, shifts in order to accommodate the opposition, the more she loses her own people, Mr Coveney told the This Week programme on RTÉ Radio One.He said Mrs May was trying to bring her country together and that it was not just Westminster, but all of British society, that was ided on the Brexit question.Middle ground“I really do think that Theresa May is a decent person trying to find a middle ground,” he said. “But her own people are impossible on this issue.”The UK is about to make a “huge, huge decision” of generational consequence and British politicians needed to think about their country and not party politics. “I think it is extraordinary that that hasn’t happened.”He said there were iniduals in all the parties that were trying to find a consensus, but in terms of the leaderships “it hasn’t happened”.Mr Coveney said that the personalities might change in the leadership of the Conservative Party but the facts would not.In the UK the Brexit debate has been about party politics and personalities. Some people think that the UK could have achieved a better withdrawal deal if it had had a different prime minister, but in his view this idea was mistaken, he said.A lot of British politicians did not understand the nature of the EU, or the situation in Northern Ireland, and had tried to “dumb this down” to a simplistic argument about Britain versus the EU, when in fact it was a case of “two friends” trying to navigate through the complexity of a very difficult agreement.The UK is due to exit the EU on October 31st next if it cannot negotiate another extension. Mr Coveney warned that the political landscape is changing in Europe as well as the UK with the coming EU elections. Time was of the essence and the danger was that the UK’s political system would simply not be able to agree a solution before the October 31st deadline.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

It will also consider whether holding votes in parliament to test support for possible solutions would be a useful prelude to MPs considering the legislation. But whatever the outcome of any votes, I will not be simply asking MPs to think again. Instead I will ask them to look at a new and improved deal with fresh pairs of eyes – and to give it their support,” she wrote.The government has ruled out seeking any changes to the text of the withdrawal agreement itself, and international development secretary Rory Stewart suggested that the changes would involve commitments to maintaining labour and environmental standards. He said the government and Labour were “about half an inch apart” on those issues and on how to maintain a strong trading relationship with the EU and the rest of the world.“None of us want to remain in the European Union, none of us want a no-deal Brexit, which means logically there has to be a deal,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.“We’re in the territory of a deal, and where we need to focus is parliament and particularly getting Labour votes across – maybe not Jeremy Corbyn’s vote but there are many other moderate, sensible Labour MPs that we should be able to bring across.”Second referendumMr Corbyn told the same programme that Labour would seek to put any deal approved by parliament to a confirmatory referendum but he stopped short of endorsing a second Brexit referendum if MPs failed to back a deal.“I think if there’s any future public vote it has to be on the basis of some credible option that’s put forward there. At the moment we do not have a credible option because parliament has actually not agreed on anything,” he said.The Labour leader declined to say if he wished to see the UK leaving the EU or remaining within it. He said free movement of people would end when the UK left the EU but there would be “a great deal of movement of workers” in some sectors.“It would be part of our negotiations the extent to which workers would transfer from one country to the other and what the needs for it would be,” he said.“We would ensure that there would be an ability to move from country to country . . . particularly where there’s a need of a workforce to achieve that.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Doug MillsThe New York Times Only one person can save us from the dangerous belligerent in the White House. And that person is Donald Trump. How screwed up is that? Will the president let himself be pushed into a parlous war by national security adviser John Bolton, who once buoyed the phony case on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq? Or will Trump drag back his national security adviser and the other uber hawks from the precipice of their fondest, bloodiest desire to attack Iran?Can Cadet Bone Spurs, as Iraq war veteran Senator Tammy Duckworth called Trump, set Senator Tom Cotton straight that winning a war with Iran would not merely entail “two strikes, the first strike and the last strike”. Holy cakewalk.Once we counted on Trump’s advisers to pump the brakes on an out-of-control president. Now we count on the president to pump the brakes on out-of-control advisers. “On one side you have a president who doesn’t want war, who simply wants to do with Iran what he has done with North Korea, to twist the arm of the Iranians to bring them to a negotiation on his terms,” said Gérard Araud, the recently departed French ambassador to the United States. “He thinks they will suffer and, at the end, they will grovel in front of his power.”But in a way, Araud said, the face-off with the Iranians is more “primitive and dangerous” because, besides Bolton, other factions in the Middle East are also “dreaming of going to war”. “Even if Trump doesn’t personally want war, we are now at the mercy of any incident, because we are at maximum tension on both sides,” said Araud, recalling Candidate Trump’s bellicose Twitter ultimatums in 2016 when Iran’s Revolutionary Guards held US sailors blindfolded at gunpoint for 15 hours.Given their sour feelings about President George W Bush shattering the Middle East and their anger at Trump shredding the Iran nuclear deal, Europeans are inclined to see the US as trying to provoke Iran into war. This time the Europeans will not be coming along, and who can blame them? War tutorsI’m having an acid flashback to 2002 when an immature, insecure, ill-informed president was bamboozled by his war tutors. There is the same feeling of the hawks building a calculated campaign for a Middle East invasion. Bush’s administration had a month’s long rollout strategy. “From a marketing point of view,” Andrew Card, Bush’s chief of staff, said in the summer of 2002, “you don’t introduce new products in August.” Have the hawks around Trump been waiting to get through two rings of fire – the threat from special counsel Robert Mueller and the re-election of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to roll out their latest ingenious product: World War III?In an echo of the hawks conspiring with Iraqi exiles to concoct a casus belli for Iraq, Bolton told members of an Iranian exile group in Paris in 2017 that the Trump administration should go for regime change in Tehran. “And that’s why, before 2019, we here will celebrate in Tehran!” Bolton cheerily told the exiles. When Bolton was the fifth column in the Bush Two state department, there to lurk around and report back on flower child Colin Powell, he complained that Bush’s “axis of evil” (Iran, Iraq, North Korea) was too limited, adding three more of his own (Cuba, Libya, Syria). Then, in 2018, Bolton talked about “the troika of tyranny” (Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela). His flirtations with military intervention in Venezuela this month irritated Trump.The 70-year-old with the Yeti moustache is an insatiable interventionist with an abiding faith in unilateralism and pre-emptive war. (The cost of attenuated US post-911 wars is now calculated at $5.9 trillion.) ChaosBush and Trump are similar in some ways, but also very different. As Trump biographer Michael D’Antonio notes: Bush was interested in clarity. Trump wants chaos. Bush wanted to trust his domineering advisers. Trump is always imagining betrayal. Bush wanted to be a war hero, like his dad. Trump does not want to be trapped in an interminable war that will consume his presidency.Certainly, the biographer says, Trump enjoys playing up the scary aspects of brown people with foreign names and ominous titles like “mullah” and “ayatollah” to stoke his base. But Trump, unlike Bush, is driven by the drama of it. “It’s a game of revving up the excitement and making people afraid, and then backing off on the fear in order to declare that he’s resolved the situation,” D’Antonio said. “Trump prefers threats and ultimatums to action because that allows him to look big and tough and get attention without doing something for which he will be held responsible. This is who he is at his core: an attention-seeking, action-averse propagandist who is terrified of accountability in the form of coffins arriving at Dover air force base.”David Axelrod, who had the military briefing about what a war with Iran would look like when he was in the Obama White House, said: “I’m telling you. It’s not a pretty picture.” He says he is not sure which movie Bolton is starring in: Dr Strangelove or Wag the Dog. “If part of your brand is that you’re not going to get the US into unnecessary wars,” he said, “why in the world would you hire John Bolton?” – New York Times serviceRead more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph audio briefings sign new whatsapp group","story":"Want audio briefings direct to your WhatsApp?

So far, China has lost about 20 per cent of its breeding herd,” she said.She added:“The fever is in every single province in China and it’s also in Cambodia and Vietnam. It’s spreading and nothing has been put in place to stop it. The Chinese authorities have reportedly brought in a requirement to test animals when they arrive in the abattoir but there are still a hell of a lot of animals being transported all over China and very few controls on transport and biosecurity.”Richard Brown, director of Gira, an industry analyst, said that African swine fever was set to have as big an impact on the worldwide meat industry as BSE.“The Chinese eat far more pork than any other protein. A very large number of pigs are going to die because this is a naive herd – they’ve never been exposed to this disease. In China, pigs are reared largely in backyard and small family farms and there is little biosecurity. The Chinese government was slow to accept they had African swine fever and because they haven’t compensated farmers people have not admitted they have it,” he said.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleHe added that Chinese pork production is set to reduce by about 13 million tons this year - about the same amount of pork that the US produces every year.About 60 per cent of the pork consumed in the UK is from Europe, said Dr Davies, so price rises will eventually hit the UK.She added that price rises may bite sooner in restaurants, hotels and other food outlets, the majority of whose pork is imported.“Some indications have shown that in the first quarter of this year the price has gone up by about 40p a kilo which is a massive price hike,” she said.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Pandemics and epidemicsPrince George, Charlotte and Louis join Chelsea Flower Show fun after helping Duchess of Cambridge build her wonderland gardenBoris Johnson being advised by Sir Lynton Crosby on leadership race - as minister warns it is \u0026#39not a reality TV contest\u0026#39Comment: Working mothers are under pressure and deserve better redundancy protectionDrop support for Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit deal if you want a general election pact, Nigel Farage tells Boris JohnsonGordon Brown: Tory  SNP Punch and Judy show risks 50 years of ision in ScotlandThe Labour Party grandee denies spying for his Czech friend amid claims of a Cold War spy scandal Cocaine dealer enjoys luxury spa break half way through his nine-year prison sentenceHow a former MI6 spy revealed Christopher Steele dossier details to an old friend from the world of espionageTheresa May\u0026#39s spy chiefs were briefed on explosive Chistopher Steele dossier before Donald Trump Theresa May\u0026#39s \u0026#39bold Brexit offer\u0026#39 is just a \u0026#39retread\u0026#39 of old ideas, leaked document suggestsComment: Letting drug dealers out of prison to go on spa breaks is criminally stupidRuth Davidson to rein in Boris attacks amid fears SNP will use them to drive up independence supportJeremy Corbyn says Labour could keep freedom of movement after BrexitDUP says it is not to blame for Theresa May excluding Northern Ireland veterans from historic prosecution amnestyIndia\u0026#39s Narendra Modi on track for a second term as PM, exit polls predictUS \u0026#39afraid\u0026#39 of war with Iran, claims  head of Revolutionary GuardAirlines face pressure to scrap charges for name changes on tickets, as Civil Aviation Authority signal crackdown The Greta Thunberg effect?

One security source said they included South African nationals.There were no reports of deaths. A witness, Mohamed el-Mandouh, told Reuters he heard a very loud explosion while sitting in traffic near the site of the blast.Pictures posted on social media showed a bus with some of its windows blown out or shattered, and debris in the road next to a low wall with a hole in it.In December, three Vietnamese tourists and an Egyptian guide were killed and at least 10 others injured when a roadside bomb hit their tour bus less than 4 kilometres (2.5 miles) from the Giza pyramids.South Africa\u0027s foreign ministry said staff from its embassy in Egypt were visiting hospitals to check on the reported injuries.The museum is due to open next year as the new home for some of the country\u0027s top antiquities on a site adjoining the world-famous Giza pyramids. It is part of an effort to boost tourism, a key source of foreign revenue for Egypt.The sector has been recovering after tourist numbers dropped in the wake of a 2011 uprising and the 2015 bombing of a Russian passenger jet.There was no damage to the museum from the blast, which happened 50 metres from its outer fence and more than 400 metres from the museum building, the Antiquities Ministry said in a statement.There was no immediate claim of responsibility.Prince George, Charlotte and Louis join Chelsea Flower Show fun after helping Duchess of Cambridge build her wonderland gardenBoris Johnson being advised by Sir Lynton Crosby on leadership race - as minister warns it is \u0026#39not a reality TV contest\u0026#39Comment: Working mothers are under pressure and deserve better redundancy protectionDrop support for Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit deal if you want a general election pact, Nigel Farage tells Boris JohnsonGordon Brown: Tory  SNP Punch and Judy show risks 50 years of ision in ScotlandThe Labour Party grandee denies spying for his Czech friend amid claims of a Cold War spy scandal Cocaine dealer enjoys luxury spa break half way through his nine-year prison sentenceHow a former MI6 spy revealed Christopher Steele dossier details to an old friend from the world of espionageTheresa May\u0026#39s spy chiefs were briefed on explosive Chistopher Steele dossier before Donald Trump Theresa May\u0026#39s \u0026#39bold Brexit offer\u0026#39 is just a \u0026#39retread\u0026#39 of old ideas, leaked document suggestsComment: Letting drug dealers out of prison to go on spa breaks is criminally stupidRuth Davidson to rein in Boris attacks amid fears SNP will use them to drive up independence supportJeremy Corbyn says Labour could keep freedom of movement after BrexitDUP says it is not to blame for Theresa May excluding Northern Ireland veterans from historic prosecution amnestyIndia\u0026#39s Narendra Modi on track for a second term as PM, exit polls predictUS \u0026#39afraid\u0026#39 of war with Iran, claims  head of Revolutionary GuardAirlines face pressure to scrap charges for name changes on tickets, as Civil Aviation Authority signal crackdown The Greta Thunberg effect?

The counted result is due on Thursday.The six week campaign has been largely peaceful, though ended with violent clashes on the outskirts of Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal where the BJP have been skirmishing with the regional Trinamool Congress party.There were sporadic clashes throughout the campaign as Mr Modi pushed to pick up seats in the target-rich state to offset expected losses elsewhere.The projected result emerged as Mr Modi attracted attracted ire and bemusement yesterday after donning saffron robes to meditate in a Himalayan cave, in a bid to garner voters at the end of the campaign.In pictures released by his party press machine, the PM is seen wearing the orange garments synonymous with Hindu priests and sitting cross-legged in a cave near the Kedarnath shrine, in the northern state of Uttarakhand.A master of the grand political gesture, Mr Modi and his aides tweeted the photos, hoping they would strike a chord with his austere, religious supporters.However, as violence continued in West Bengal and people were voting in Mr Modi’s own constituency of Varanasi, the holy city on the River Ganges, the pictures were mocked online.“No meditation is complete or meaningful without the right attire, red carpet and of course a stage managed photo opportunity,” wrote Rupa Subramanya prominent economist and a former BJP supporter turned critic.Other observers and much of the Indian media turned their attention to the caves themselves - which are actually in a man-made retreat.They can be booked online for Rs 990 (£11.20) a day and the facilities include electricity, drinking water, and “morning tea, breakfast, lunch, evening tea and dinner at prescribed timing which can be changed upon request”, reported the Hindustan Times.The cave also has a telephone connection and an attendant who can be summoned with a bell, the newspaper added.Prince George, Charlotte and Louis join Chelsea Flower Show fun after helping Duchess of Cambridge build her wonderland gardenBoris Johnson being advised by Sir Lynton Crosby on leadership race - as minister warns it is \u0026#39not a reality TV contest\u0026#39Comment: Working mothers are under pressure and deserve better redundancy protectionDrop support for Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit deal if you want a general election pact, Nigel Farage tells Boris JohnsonGordon Brown: Tory  SNP Punch and Judy show risks 50 years of ision in ScotlandThe Labour Party grandee denies spying for his Czech friend amid claims of a Cold War spy scandal Cocaine dealer enjoys luxury spa break half way through his nine-year prison sentenceHow a former MI6 spy revealed Christopher Steele dossier details to an old friend from the world of espionageTheresa May\u0026#39s spy chiefs were briefed on explosive Chistopher Steele dossier before Donald Trump Theresa May\u0026#39s \u0026#39bold Brexit offer\u0026#39 is just a \u0026#39retread\u0026#39 of old ideas, leaked document suggestsComment: Letting drug dealers out of prison to go on spa breaks is criminally stupidRuth Davidson to rein in Boris attacks amid fears SNP will use them to drive up independence supportJeremy Corbyn says Labour could keep freedom of movement after BrexitDUP says it is not to blame for Theresa May excluding Northern Ireland veterans from historic prosecution amnestyUS \u0026#39afraid\u0026#39 of war with Iran, claims  head of Revolutionary GuardAirlines face pressure to scrap charges for name changes on tickets, as Civil Aviation Authority signal crackdown The Greta Thunberg effect?

But Deliveroo has issues when it comes to relations with its workforce, and Amazon isn\u0027t likely to be able to help much with themClick to followThe IndependentDeliveroo has secured a big investment but will that benefit its deliverers? There’s no more tasty a dish than the millions of dollars in Amazon cash Deliveroo is set to chow down on.\u0026nbspThe US tech kingpin is the lead investor in the\u0026nbspLondon based food delivery firm’s latest cash call, which raised $575m (£450m) in total.\u0026nbspBad news for Uber. It has obviously had its\u0026nbspattention\u0026nbspon other things of late, such as a New York Flotation and the indigestion caused to investors by the lacklustre after market for its shares.\u0026nbspEU introduces new minimum rights for ‘gig economy’ workersBut Uber Eats remains an important part of its attempt to expand beyond its ride sharing app. It even reportedly looked at buying Deliveroo.\u0026nbspThe would be Amazon of transport now has to contend with the real Amazon backing a major rival in that space.\u0026nbspAmazon had a crack at the business itself, only to retreat. That isn’t unusual. The same thing happened with its attempt to break into ticket sales, for example.\u0026nbspIt’s a restless experimenter, something that plays a key role in its success. This\u0026nbspmeans\u0026nbspaccepting that they’re not all going to work and being willing to\u0026nbspmove on when they don’t.\u0026nbspThe interesting thing here is that Amazon is not moving on. It’s a case of if you can’t beat ‘em, buy in. The investment gives it a seat at the table and a chance to see what works and what doesn’t with a company that’s succeeding with a business it was interested in but couldn’t make fly.“We’re excited to see what they do next,” said Amazon’s UK country manager Doug Gurr. And we’re just as excited to see what we can learn through watching the development of out new best pals’\u0026nbsp“innovative technology and service”.\u0026nbspAmazon has also reportedly looked at buying Deliveroo outright and if\u0026nbspfounder Will Shu does come to see a sale rather than a flotation as the end game, it would now surely be in the box seat.\u0026nbspIn the meantime Shu benefits from having the big dog in his corner and at the end of a phone line if he needs it. The market is taking that very seriously, with shares in rivals such as Just Eat falling sharply in response to the news.\u0026nbspThe biggest challenge for Deliveroo, which has raised $1.5bn to date, is the same as that facing Uber, Lyft, and many of the other current generation of tech stars. It has to find a way of sustainably turning a profit.\u0026nbspAmazon has an excellent handle on how to prove the doubters wrong when it comes to moving from a loss making investment phase to making handsome profit. In the meantime, it will be more relaxed about Deliveroo’s losses than almost any other investor, more willing to give it the leeway to be aggressive. This helps to explain why rivals shuddered.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

I must have spent a small fortune in his Richer Sounds hi-fi shops down the years, and, in a true test, I do not begrudge him a single penny. What I’ve bought has always worked, seemingly been the best I could afford at my price range, and the staff have always been helpful and knowledgeable. And his stores open at hours I can, and want, to visit.\u0026nbspYou don’t feel ripped off either. Richer Sounds specialises in offering discounts from reputable brands, some of them high-end. So, there’s little glitz, no fripperies attached. Richer’s outlets are practical, down-to-earth, and because of that, genuine.\u0026nbspBefore the editor screams “stop”, and questions how much Richer is paying for this piece of advertorial, I will end there. You get the picture.\u0026nbspRicher does things differently. His first branch was on London Bridge. That may sound glamorous, but to those who don’t know London’s retail scene that well, it isn’t. Bond Street it is not.Richer Sounds owner hands over control of hi-fi retailer to staffWhat drove him was footfall. He saw – by the way he was aged just 19 at the time – just how many people went in and out of London Bridge station during the day, and the result is a store right by the terminus entrance, next to all the snack bars, that has been regularly cited by Guinness Book of Records as possessing the highest sales per square feet of any shop in the world.Constantly, there is method in his madness. His creed, espoused in his book The Richer Way – a case for required reading on all business and management courses if ever there was one – relates, among other measures, how he rewards staff with holidays in homes owned by the company. The company-owned aspect is vital, enhancing the feeling of collectiveness, allowing them to share experiences, giving them a selection to choose from, and fostering chat and excitement during the year. It’s clever.\u0026nbspLikewise, he does not believe in zero hours. His workers are part of the business, and treated as such.\u0026nbspNow, Richer has gone a step, or rather a leap, further. He’s switching his company into one that is owned by the staff, putting 60 per cent\u0026nbspof his shares into a trust held for the employees. There’s more: each of the current 531 workers will receive a cash bonus of £1,000 for each year they’ve been with the firm. That calculates to an average payment of £8,000 per employee. Many chains would be proud of the eight-year figure, given the churn of staff in retail. But Richer has 39 staff who will collect more than £20,000 each.\u0026nbspThe scheme that he, and presumably his advisers, have devised, is smart. Richer Sounds, which has annual sales of £200m, will pay the founder £9.2m for his shares. He will then give £3.5m worth back to the staff to be owned in trust for them. He will not be paying capital gains tax on the sale of his shares, because this move qualifies for tax breaks as part of the government’s attempt to boost employee share ownership. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

It’s a measure of the relatively slow progress to date that Richer’s transfer will make Richer Sounds one of the biggest employee-owned companies in the country. Out in front, by some margin, is of course\u0026nbspJohn Lewis.\u0026nbspBut the department store group went down that route as far back as 1929. It was not until the coalition government, in 2014, incentivised employee ownership that the push towards this form of mutuality received the required fillip. Owners who sell at least 51 per cent of the equity of the business to the employee-owned trust are exempt from capital gains tax. Staff receiving bonus payments paid via their trust can receive £3,600 a year in payouts tax free.There are signs, finally, of the model gaining traction. Some decent-sized names now populate the sector: Arup, Tiptree jams, Mott MacDonald, and Aardman, those folk behind Wallace \u0026amp Gromit. In all, there are now 350 companies either owned by their workers directly or via a trust, with another 50 said to be considering the shift.\u0026nbspJulian Richer has shown us how to save capitalismPoliticians don’t do enough to improve ownership rights for workersThey may be many in number, but they still lag in scale. Even so, the employee-owned band is thought to account for 5 per cent of GDP.\u0026nbspTax advantages apart, what the option also often provides is a solution to the thorny question of succession. You’re the owner if you have them, your children are not interested you could sell to an outsider, but they would almost certainly tear your life’s work apart, firing those staff who have become firm friends down the years, in the process. You’re not too bothered about the money you’ve made a fair amount, and you can only spend so much. Suddenly, handing over the firm to those loyal workers who have been with you through the bad times as well as good, who have witnessed heartbreak as well as triumph, and who devoted themselves to making the business as good as it is, has real appeal.\u0026nbspIt’s not plain sailing, though. When the company is bouncing, everyone is happy. But when things turn, the mood can quickly become sour. These are not mere employees any more but owner-employees, or as John Lewis insists on calling them,\u0026nbsp“partners”. Anyone doubting what it must be like for the John Lewis senior team only has to glance at the letters page of The Gazette, the weekly partnership magazine. The 83,000 staff, now facing vastly reduced annual bonuses, do not hold back when it come to criticising their leadership, openly questioning the direction the group is taking.\u0026nbspFortunately, given the health of the brand, the Richer hierarchy is unlikely to encounter any opposition, not in the short term anyway. The Richer deal is one in which everyone emerges richer – and I’ve not got to write that very often.\u0026nbspChris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Demand for winter sun was down in the Nordic region, for example. Hotel and fuel costs have been rising at a time when it has had to resort to promotional activity to tempt customers.\u0026nbspNavigating such choppy waters would be difficult for any company. Cook is trying to it with the dead weight of that debt pile attached to its keel.\u0026nbspNo wonder shareholders have been jumping for the lifeboats.

In the early years of this decade stories about it also regularly talked of lifelines, turnarounds, and refinancing deals.

As well as selling pies – a record 800 on the day of the Premier League final – Homebaked has a sister organisation: a community land trust to own buildings for the good of residents. With ownership, locals can no long be subject to the whims of government plans such as\u0026nbsphousing market renewal, which left so many surrounding properties empty.\u0026nbspFrance’s unique approach to regenerating inner citiesRegeneration is not a dirty wordTheir success has fed into a network of other like-minded businesses in Liverpool, including Kitty’s Laundrette, which has just opened its doors down the road, and Squash, a food shop and cafe in Toxteth, or Liverpool 8, in the south of the city. “Community businesses in Liverpool are transforming the city,” says\u0026nbspVidhya\u0026nbspAlakeson, chief executive of Power to Change,\u0026nbspa lottery-funded organisation that supports the sector. “The social history of Liverpool shows a tradition of solidarity and self-reliance over many years, and now that is finding a voice through the community business movement.”Erika Rushton is\u0026nbspthe chair of Baltic Creative, which owns and manages more than 100 sq\u0026nbspft of workspace in the city’s\u0026nbspBaltic Triangle district – now home to more than 600 companies, employing 3,000 people. Baltic Creative is a community interest company, which means half of its annual £400,000 surplus is invested in buying up more property to turn into workspaces, and the other half goes towards events and improvements to the surrounding area.\u0026nbsp“Liverpool is a city that has got its confidence back,” Rushton says. “Over a 30-year period, Liverpool was told that its salvation would be an inward investor or a grant from the government. The unspoken message was you’re not capable of this, we’re going to have to do it for you. We have worked to say, that’s not true, we are the economy, it’s not something that is done to us.”In total, 84 community businesses operate in the city, defined as businesses that trade for the benefit of their communities, according to Power to Change.\u0026nbspIn May, many opened their doors for community business weekend, an annual celebration of the UK’s 7,800\u0026nbspcommunity business, which contributes £1bn to the economy, Power to Change estimates.\u0026nbspPover and Delia McMullen, volunteers at Homebaked\u0026nbspbakery in North Liverpool (Hazel Sheffield)A couple of doors down from Homebaked bakery, Catherine Simmons, a project coordinator at the land trust, happens to be looking out the window of one of the empty houses when Klopp walks past. “Is that…?” she asks in disbelief. Early on, the bakery established the way it wanted to do business with Liverpool FC. It did not take grants, but instead signed a contract for the club to sell its pies in the VIP lounge. The relationship has set the tone for the way that the bakery, the land trust and other community enterprises deal with big business: as equal trading partners.When Simmons first took on her role at the land trust, she was occupied with finishing the renovation of the flats above the bakery. Now the flats have been filled with tenants, Simmons has turned her attention to the rest of houses on the row. In April, they applied for planning permission to bring the nine properties back to use. The idea was to create a blueprint for a modern high street, drawn from workshops and interviews with residents about the kinds of shops they wanted to see.Architects Urbed have drawn up plans that show the fronts of houses preserved\u0026nbsp– an important feature for residents who said they were tired of too much change – but the insides transformed into eight affordable residential units and up to four retail spaces. Urbed have designed the building to the highest environmental standards, to reduce energy bills that add to the financial pressure on lower-income residents. The initiative is being funded by Power to Change and the Homes England Community Housing Fund.\u0026nbspA couple of streets away, Kitty’s Laundrette is getting ready for its opening party. A local cinema group called Cinema Nation is putting on an archive film night themed around rebellious women – a good fit for a laundry named after Kitty Wilkinson, who let women with infected linens use her boiler during the cholera epidemic, and was instrumental in the movement to open the UK’s first public washhouse.\u0026nbspGrace Harrison, a project coordinator at Kitty’s, says that their business has been supported by a network of like-minded enterprises\u0026nbspwithin the sector. “We wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for Homebaked,” she says. At that moment a delivery of 200 beers arrives – a gift from local Love Lane brewery for the opening party at the weekend.\u0026nbspWhile Power to Change and other third sector organisations have supported Kitty’s financially, they are appealing for local residents and businesses to buy their services and make the business sustainable: “You can generate a lot of goodwill in your area, but we need people to buy with us if we want to invest locally. Community business is about learning from the third sector, but also about autonomy from income generation,” Harrison says.In south Liverpool, Squash will start the weekend’s celebrations with a street party hosted by 14 organisations on Windsor Street. Clare Owens, a co-director of Squash, says the\u0026nbspparty is an important moment for like-minded enterprises to come together and celebrate. “Running a community business is really rewarding but it can be hard work!” she says.Squash has coordinated food projects and growing spaces in the south of Liverpool for more than a decade. In 2018, it chose community business weekend to open the doors on a space designed by local people on Windsor Street, with high ceilings, natural light and meeting spaces for groups.\u0026nbspAs well as making its own sourdough, Squash sells a range of products including organic fruit and vegetables, Homebaked bread, and ingredients to get people cooking, rather than shopping for mass-produced food. Squash, like many businesses in the sector, is aiming for sustainability over profit. Owens sees this as an advantage. “We have a hundred-year street project –\u0026nbspimagine\u0026nbspfood growing on our street over a long period of time,” she says. “It’s a slow, growing project that everyone can access at their own pace. By working together and being resilient in this way, you can effect social change.”Community businesses open their doors around the UKRachael O’Byrne, community engagement lead at Kitty’s, says that changing the narrative in neighbourhoods that have suffered\u0026nbsplong-term lack of investment takes time. “It might seem like this is happening all of a sudden but in reality it has been decades in the making,” she says. “People have lived and died in this community waiting for a grand regeneration that never arrived.”But as the sector grows, collaboration between these businesses is making them increasingly resilient to challenges – and optimistic about the future. “There are so many businesses across Liverpool that are community-minded. We are forming this supportive network that means other new businesses can come to us for advice,” O’Byrne\u0026nbspsays. “It’s creating\u0026nbspa ripple effect.”power to changeOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I’m going to sing my heart out and give it my best shot.”Each finalist performed for the international public vote, which made up 50 per cent of the total vote, with the other half determined by a professional jury in each participating country.

But ultimately Sweden failed to sway the public vote, and the soulful ballad won over John Ludvik’s more upbeat but still emotional number.\u0026nbspMadonna, who performed towards the end of the ceremony, caused one of the biggest controversies of the night with an unscheduled political statement that caused uproar in Tel Aviv.\u0026nbspMadonna sparks controversy with Eurovision performanceThe Netherlands have won Eurovision 2019UK finishes bottom at Eurovision after Michael Rice’s ‘Bigger than Us’During the second part of her performance it was revealed that her\u0026nbspbacking dancers were wearing Israeli and Palestinian flags on the backs of their outfits. Organisers quickly issued a statement saying this was not a planned part of the event.“In the live broadcast of the Eurovision Song Contest Grand Final, two of Madonna’s dancers briefly displayed the Israeli and Palestinian flags on the back of their outfits,” the statement said.“This element of the performance was not part of the rehearsals which had been cleared with the EBU and the host broadcaster, KAN.

Better the Devil You Know - Sonia (Runner-up in Millstreet, 1993) 352.9ptsSonia’s Eurovision journey took her to Millstreet, Ireland - and with its population of just 1,500, it holds the record for being the smallest host “city”. The town’s equestrian arena was transformed into a TV studio for the contest, meaning that many of the video postcards between performances have a very horsey vibe. Ms Evans chit-chats to a couple of foals in hers.210 9. Making Your Mind Up - Bucks Fizz (Winner in Dublin, 1981) 355.4ptsThis tune is so synonymous with British Eurovision glory, what could possibly explain it ranking no higher than 9th?310 8. Ooh Aah... Just a Little Bit - Gina G (8th in Oslo, 1996) 360.1ptsCher has an enjoyable habit of covering Eurovision artists: ABBA (she released an entire album last year), Bucks Fizz (“Heart of Stone”), Johnny Logan (One by One), and Gina G, literally, with a rejected, gly dress. 410 7. Puppet on a String - Sandie Shaw (Winner in Vienna, 1967) 366.5ptsOur first Eurovision victory. Sandie notoriously hated this song “from the very first oompah to the final bang on the big bass drum… I was instinctively repelled by its sexist drivel and cuckoo-clock tune” she recalls in her autobiography.510 6. Where Are You? - Imaani (Runner-up in Birmingham, 1998) 366.7ptsIf there’s one UK entry that deserves more recognition than it gets, it’s this. Imaani was the UK’s fifteenth and most recent runner-up. She narrowly missed out on a hometurf victory as “Where Are You?” failed to win any points when the final jury dished out their scores.610 5. Boom Bang-a-Bang - Lulu (Winner in Madrid, 1969) 367.4ptsLulu won the 14th contest in a four-way tie with France, Spain and the Netherlands – a situation which prompted Finland, Norway, Portugal and Sweden to withdraw from the following year’s contest out of protest. Such drama! Salvador Dalí designed the promotional materials for the contest as well as the stage, which explains the slightly weird metal sculpture that Lulu performed in front of.710 4. Love Shine a Light - Katrina and the Waves (Winner in Dublin, 1997) 381.1ptsIt’s been 22 long years since Katrina Leskanich brought home our last Eurovision victory, and we suspect it’ll be at least 23 years until the next.810 3. Storm - SuRie (24th in Lisbon, 2018) 381.4ptsEurovision performances can stand out for all sorts of reasons. SuRie’s time on stage is memorable not because her microphone was snatched by a stage invader, but by the way she reacted to the situation. Few other artists on this list would have handled it so deftly.910 2. Save Your Kisses for Me - Brotherhood of Man (Winner in The Hague, 1976) 381.9ptsWith a last-second plot twist to rival those in Game of Thrones, “Save Your Kisses For Me” is the highest ranking winner on our chart.1010 1. Never Give Up on You - Lucie Jones (15th in Kiev, 2017) 398.4ptsUh oh. We fully realise that some fans will race to the bottom of this list, see “Lucie Jones” at number one, slam their Union Jack mug down, open a new tab and furiously tap out a tweet about the ludicrousness of it all. 110 10.

The Eurovision liveblog has now closed:Hello, and welcome to The Independent\u0027s Eurovision liveblog for this year\u0027s final! I\u0027ll be your host for this evening, providing the latest news, commentary, video and images from across the night, along with updates from our Eurovision Correspondent in Tel Aviv, Rob Holley (find him on Twitter\u0026nbsp@robholley\u0026nbsp)\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspObviously the biggest question everyone wants the answer to is... who\u0027s going to win? This year it really is anyone\u0027s guess, but you can take a look at Rob\u0027s predictions here:\u0026nbsphttps:www.arts-entertainmentmusicfeatureseurovision-2019-winners-prediction-iceland-sweden-netherlands-tel-aviv-israel-a8913056.htmlThe biggest controversy around this year\u0027s competition is the fact that it is being hosted in Israel. Many, including artists like Roger Waters and the band Wolf Alice, have called for a cultural boycott over the country\u0027s treatment of Palestinians. However, others disagree with the boycott - like Israeli heavy metal band Orphaned Land, who spoke with me about the work they\u0027ve been doing to promote peace and unity through music\u0026nbsphttps:www.arts-entertainmentmusicfeaturesorphaned-land-band-israel-palestine-boycott-eurovision-tel-aviv-music-a8919746.htmlIf you\u0027re planning on voting for your favourite country tonight, here\u0027s how to do it\u0026nbsphttps:www.arts-entertainmentmusicnewseurovision-2019-how-to-vote-app-online-website-text-uk-bbc-israel-a8913231.htmlMadonna fans won\u0027t be too happy about this.

As Eurovision visitors and revellers poured into the massive complex for the final, the group chanted “Songs and glitter cannot hide homeland being occupied” while holding up pictures of Gaza and the West Bank.“We want to expose the truth and fight the idea that this is a normal democratic country. There are daily violations of human rights, there are people under military occupation.,” Omer, 26 an Israeli activist told The Independent.“They are trying to pink-wash and art wash the truth with Eurovision, to use this image of Tel Aviv as an LGBT friendly space while people are killed in Gaza. They forget there is an occupation, that is part of the daily reality of Palestinians that they have pass through checkpoints, that they don’t have passports that they are refugees, they are prisoners of the Israeli state.”Via Bel Trew as the ceremony kicks off:Across town at the sprawling Eurovision village over 80 street food stands, several bars and a massive statue of Israeli Eurovision winner Netta are spread across 15-acres of park. There fans flocked to watch the show on massive screens.The location of the village sparked controversy among some pro-Palestinian protest groups as it lies on Charles Close Park, which they say was built on the ruins of a pre-1948 mostly Arab neighbourhood called al-Manshiyya.But unperturbed on Saturday, fans from across Europe and Israel, spent the day on the seafront celebrating in the sunshine.“I’ve been going to Eurovision since 2013 - I’m an accredited fan and really by far this is the best and biggest village I’ve seen.

Or did he get the work-experience boy to do it?’Click to followThe Independent CultureConservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg’s new book has been savaged by the critics, who have dismissed his tribute to the Victorians as “staggeringly silly”, “sentimental jingoism” and “so terrible”.The influential Brexiteer’s latest work The Victorians: Twelve Titans Who Forged Britain\u0026nbsplooks at the lives of a dozen eminent 19th-century figures – including Queen Victoria, Sir Robert Peel and Lord Palmerston.Writing in The Sunday Times, Dominic Sandbrook described it as “so bad, so boring, so mind-bogglingly banal that if it had been written by anybody else it would never have been published”.The historian added: “Did Rees-Mogg really write this? Or did he get the work-experience boy to do it? In any case, the overall effect is soul-destroying. There have been many books\u0026nbspon the Victorians, but surely none as badly written.”AN Wilson was equally withering, describing Mr Rees-Mogg’s effort as “anathema ... to anyone with an ounce of historical, or simply common, sense”. In his review for The Times, Mr Wilson said the book “consists of a dozen clumsily written pompous schoolboy compositions … What a staggeringly silly book this is!”Created with Sketch.The Victorians: Long to reign over us Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Historian Kim A Wagner called the book “a sentimental vision of the past as the author wishes it had been” resembling a series of “half-remembered anecdotes from a Boy’s Own story, or perhaps tales told by his nanny”.“The book really belongs in the celebrity autobiography section of the bookstore,” he wrote in The Observer’s review. “At best, it can be seen as a curious artefact of the kind of sentimental jingoism and empire-nostalgia currently afflicting our country.”Jacob Rees-Mogg claims majority of Tories will back Brexit PartyRees-Mogg\u0027s sister standing for Farage\u0027s Brexit Party in Euro-electionThe \u0026nbspreviewer Kathryn Hughes wrote: “At least we know\u0026nbspThe Victorians\u0026nbspisn’t ghost written, since no self-respecting freelancer would dare ask for payment for such rotten prose.”The MP for North East Somerset has said he spent around 300 hours writing it, and the register of MPs’ financial interests shows he has already received a £12,500 payment from Penguin Random House.The father of six said his children “did not delay my work ... as Peter, Mary, Thomas, Anselm, Alfred and Sixtus were kindly looked after by my wife Helena and, of course, nanny.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mick O’Hare reckons that Apollo 11’s\u0026nbsplesser-known sibling finally\u0026nbspdeserves its moment in the spotlightClick to followThe IndependentApollo 10 was the dry run for the moon landingIt’s a great pub quiz question. What’s the fastest human beings have ever travelled? And what were they travelling in when they did it? No it’s not Lewis Hamilton in a 200mph Mercedes Formula 1 car. The answer is a whopping 24,791mph and the men who did it were sitting in a metal cone with less space inside than a family hatchback. That’s quick. Even the world’s fastest fighter jets struggle to muster 2000mph.That metal cone, part of the Apollo 10 spacecraft, was launched towards the moon atop a huge Saturn V rocket in May 1969, and is the only part that returned to Earth. It now resides in London’s Science Museum. Apollo 10 was the dry run for the moon landing that would, just two months later, entrance the entire planet. And while the attention of the world will once again focus on the deeds of Apollo 11 and its crew when the 50th anniversary rolls round in July, its lesser-known sibling also deserves its moment in the spotlight. For if things had gone badly in May, Neil Armstrong would not have been making his “small step” onto the moon’s surface on 21 July.“It was the dress rehearsal for Apollo 11,” says Doug Millard, a senior curator at the Science Museum and the man overseeing the priceless spacecraft in London. “If it had gone wrong, that would have put the programme back months, and John F\u0026nbspKennedy had promised that America would have a man on the moon – and returned safely – by the end of the decade.”Nasa)Amazingly, it came only two years after three astronauts had perished in the Apollo 1 fire that almost brought the United States’ space programme to a standstill. “With that in mind, had Apollo 10 failed catastrophically it could have ended the entire programme,” points out Millard. “Public opinion had already been damaged by Apollo 1 and with the Vietnam war taking up America’s priorities and cash elsewhere, appetite for spaceflight would have dwindled.”The Cold War was waging, and the US and the Soviet Union were embroiled in proxy wars on Earth but also fighting for supremacy in space. The race to the moon was, of course, ideological as much (if not more) as it was scientific. After launching the world’s first artificial satellite – Sputnik 1, the first man in space – Yuri Gagarin, and the first man to walk in space – Alexei Leonov, the Soviet Union had taken an early lead. But once Nasa\u0026nbspwas revamped and reorganised in the mid-1960s the Americans had gained the upper hand.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

But Millard posits an interesting counter view: “If the proxy war in space avoided a real war between nuclear powers on Earth, then it was arguably money well spent,” he says.“Apollo 10 was a learning mission,” he goes on. “If it had experienced non-catastrophic failure, the programme would have continued, but Apollo 11 would then have become the second dress-rehearsal, and Apollo 12 would have become the landing party, and so on.”It was the dress rehearsal for Apollo 11.\u0026nbspIf it had gone wrong, that would have put the programme back months, and John F Kennedy had promised that America would have a man on the moon by the end of the decadeEugene Cernan, John Young and commander Thomas Stafford blasted off from Cape Kennedy (now Cape Canaveral) on 18 May. They circumnavigated the moon as Apollo 8 had done five months earlier and carried out the manoeuvres necessary if a spacecraft was to land on the surface. The command module (the part of the spacecraft now in London and the only section of any Apollo mission that would return to Earth) docked with and separated from the lunar module – the four-footed lander that would carry astronauts to the surface.It was during this fly-by phase that the mission came closest to ignominious and calamitous failure. The lunar module rolled violently under engine ignition. It lasted 8 seconds but as Cernan said afterwards “you have no idea how long 8 seconds can be”. It was a frightening moment only tempered by the discovery that it was caused by human error, not a problem with the spacecraft itself, which meant Apollo 11 was still on track.Apollo 10 astronauts heard eerie music on dark side of the moon“What the Apollo programme shows is the incredible achievements humans can perform if they set their minds to it,” Millard says. “That cohort of American military engineers and technicians was the last generation to live through the Second World War, growing up with a command structure which lived on in Nasa\u0026nbspand drove the Apollo programme.London’s is the only Apollo spacecraft outside the United States, all the others were eventually recalled, so the city is privileged indeed. Arriving on loan in 1976 the spacecraft has spent longer in the UK than in its home country.Nasa)Standing in front of the ageing capsule in the Science Museum, it seems impossible that this was the most technologically advanced vehicle on (and above) the planet in 1969. Its stainless steel exterior is a dull brown, almost rusty, colour and its crumbling heat shield – which protected the astronauts from the intense frictional heat of more than 2,500C as the craft re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere – looks like crumbling barbecue charcoal. It stands a mere 3.48 metres high and is 3.91 metres across its base (the Saturn V rocket which blasted it out of the Earth’s atmosphere and on to the moon was, by comparison, 111 metres high).What going into space does to an astronaut’s DNASpace is doing strange things to astronauts’ bodies, Nasa study showsNasa says astronauts are endangered after India blows up a satelliteBut at least as far as the Science Museum is concerned Apollo 10 will have one more day in the sun. From 23 May the museum will present its Summer of Space where Apollo 10 will take pride of place alongside British astronaut Tim Peake’s Soyuz capsule as the latter ends its nationwide tour. There will be workshops, gallery tours and other Apollo artefacts never before seen in Britain.And what about that record? As it approached the Earth’s atmosphere on its return journey Apollo 10 hit the fastest speed a human-built object has ever achieved. But why did it fly faster than other moon missions? Unencumbered by rocks and specimens from the moon’s surface, plus a bit of tweaking with the thrusters to use up extra fuel left over from when the lunar module excursion was aborted because of the violent rolling, Apollo 10 was able to travel faster than its fellow spacecraft, and it’s a record that still stands today.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But, wonders David Barnett, will anything ever change?\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentHas Jeremy Kyle been thrown under a bus – a sacrificial sop to offer evidence that TV networks do take action?On a Saturday in September a 28-year-old woman called Mary Richardson took her own life after drinking beer laced with rat poison.\u0026nbspAt her inquest, Eliza Withers told how Mary was the lover of her son, Henry, and had lived with her at their home in Hull for six months. She described Mary as quick to anger, and said that on the day she died Mary had been told by neighbours that Henry was with another woman.The other woman, a Mrs Kirk, was married but her husband was away. Henry had spent the night at her house after drinking with her. Later that night, Mary killed herself by putting three packets of strychnine into a glass of beer and drinking it.At the inquest, it was reported that a crowd “several hundred” strong, mainly women, gathered and when Mrs Kirk left the hearing they followed her, “hooting and hissing all the way”. She had an escort of four policemen for fear there would be violence against her by the angry mob.\u0026nbspAn unedifying story, and one\u0026nbspwith all the elements that make perhaps the perfect Jeremy Kyle\u0026nbspShow. A philandering man, an unfaithful wife, copious amounts of alcohol, a tragic death and a baying crowd.\u0026nbspBut, of course, it isn’t a Jeremy Kyle episode. It’s taken from a report in the Hull Packet newspaper, dated 16 September 1870. It does, however, flag up two things about human nature we have always, it seems, immersed ourselves in the minutiae of other people’s lives, the grimier the better. And, given half a chance, we’ll happily transform into a bloodthirsty mob to vent our spleens against those who we consider to be the guilty parties.The Jeremy Kyle Show, is of course, off the air for what appears to be good, now, following the sad death of Steve Dymond, who is understood to have taken his own life after filming an episode of the show, which was due to be broadcast last week.\u0026nbspIt’s turned a spotlight on the whole industry of reality TV, the genre which makes “stars” of ordinary people… with, it turns out, some careful scripting, nudging and guidance from the production teams in order to make “good” telly.Programmes like Jeremy Kyle’s are known as tabloid talk shows, aping as they do the red-top newspapers’ historic tendency to lay bare people’s lives in the most excruciatingly salacious detail. Many years ago I was visiting a friend in the North-east who made his living working for a news agency that mainly serviced the tabloids.If that sounds harsh, then that’s because it is. But the \u0027dogshit\u0027 lives of those less fortunate than ourselves have always made for compulsive reading and viewing. At its peak the News of the World was selling more than eight million copies a week. By the ignominious end of its 14-year run last week, The Jeremy Kyle Show was pulling in a million viewers every weekday at 9.25am.Jeremy Kyle wasn’t the originator of the tabloid talk show, of course he’s more likely to be the curator of its death. It’s an American invention that probably broke out into the mainstream in 1986 with the launch of the Oprah Winfrey Show. Oprah encouraged people – the ordinary, everyday folk and celebrities – to open up in a confessional manner, laying bare their secrets before the soothing, encouraging presence of the host.Oprah also involved the audience, giving them a space to stand up and talk about the issue of the day. It was an almost intimate, welcoming atmosphere, like perhaps a group therapy session, until you remembered it was being watched by millions of people at home.The success of the Oprah show inevitably spawned a host of imitators, including The Jerry Springer Show in 1991. London-born Springer moved to the States at an early age and worked as a lawyer, a politician (he ran for Congress in 1970) and a journalist before getting his own show. For three years Springer tried to engender serious political and topical debate on his shows. Ratings weren’t good. In 1994 the programme was relaunched as a more tabloid-orientated talk show and things went stratospheric.A similar show hosted by Maury Povich had launched in the US the same year as Jerry Springer. Again, it tackled weighty subjects in the beginning, but soon joined the scramble for confessionals and confrontation. By 1998 Jerry Springer was beating Oprah in the ratings and the TV studios were full of angry people, spurned lovers, betrayed spouses, disputed paternities. The discussions got more and more heated and even violent burly security guards were employed to drag those appearing apart, the audiences got more and more frenzied and riled.Just like with poor old Mrs Kirk in 1870 Hull, followed home by a crowd that was “hooting and hissing all the way” with “some not very complimentary epithets were addressed to her, some of the mob were armed with sticks, tongs, and pokers, as if they meant to ‘punish’ the object of their wrath.”Created with Sketch.

It premiered in 2005, when Jerry Springer was moving into radio, Ricki Lake had left her own talk show, and Maury Povich tried to get back into more serious TV debate, hosting a show with his wife, the broadcaster Connie Chung, that ultimately drew more ratings.Brits had been fed a diet of Springer, Ricki Lake and the faux respectability of the Judge Judy show, where the same tabloid grievances were hammered out but in front of a telegenic judge for many years by this point, and presumably the idea by the TV companies was that watching American trailer trash was fine, but why don’t we exploit our home-grown \u0027dogshit\u0027 lives?Trisha Goddard had begun her own tabloid talk show in 1998, and in 2004 it had moved to Channel 5. Jerry Springer brought his brand to the UK in 2005, the same year that Jeremy Kyle was brought in by ITV to fill the gap left by Trisha. Tabloid talk TV was firmly established on the British daytime schedules. And if there were any fears that we would be more reserved than our trans-Atlantic cousins when it came to baring our souls and rolling up our sleeves for the cameras, then they were unfounded.\u0026nbspIt’s a curious thing.\u0026nbsp Nobody seems to want to admit to watching the Jeremy Kyle Show, yet a million did so every single day. Who were they? Students? Pensioners? Homeworkers and homemakers? The unemployed?Gladiatorial combat ensued, and when the other shows fell by the wayside Jeremy Kyle held firm his position, offering his pronouncements on the parade of undignified arguments and fights, the litany of drugs and booze and sex and personal tragedy, playing to the radged up audience, like a sneering, public school-educated Caesar.It’s a curious thing. Nobody seems to want to admit to watching the Jeremy Kyle Show, yet a million did so every single day. Who were they? Students? Pensioners? Homeworkers and homemakers? The unemployed?Probably all of these. And, quite probably, the majority of the audience was working class. Not because they were glad to have some kind of representation on TV, not because they identified with those spitting and snarling and demanding DNA tests on screen, but because, sometimes, it’s something of a relief to know that there are people worse off than yourself.But that doesn’t make it right. In fact, it makes things a whole lot worse. The Jeremy Kyle Show and its ilk are bread and circuses for the masses. They are the footsoldiers of austerity politics, smoke and mirrors and sleight of hand to keep the impoverished and the disaffected numbed from their own situations. Don’t look at your own problems, they say, look at these people. Laugh at their pain. There but for the grace of God go you, eh?\u0026nbspThe real surprise is that The Jeremy Kyle Show lasted 14 years, and would no doubt have gone on ad infinitum but for the death of Steve Dymond. The show must have been a gift to the incoming Conservative-Liberal Democrat government in 2010, with its warnings that the entire country would have to tighten its belts and adopt a Blitz spirit to get through some very tough years.Derided as just trash for so long, we’re perhaps now reconsidering. People are appearing on TV shows and then killing themselves.\u0026nbsp Are any ratings worth that?Why have the populace scrutinising the bankers and financiers and architects of the bad times of the financial collapse when you can instead point to the TV screen where miserable people are screaming blue murder at each other, and shake your head, and say, “Look at this lot and their \u0027dogshit\u0027 lives.”The cancellation of The Jeremy Kyle Show almost signals a collective sobering up of telly-watching Britain. Everybody’s blinking, and looking around, and wondering what the hell happened over the past 14 years. Human bear-baiting on our screens, every single morning, all week long? How did we let that happen?\u0026nbspAnd now we’re turning our attention to the rest of the reality TV output. Derided as just trash for so long, we’re perhaps now reconsidering. Trash, maybe, but dangerous trash at that. People are appearing on TV shows and then killing themselves. Are any ratings worth that?Of course, The Jeremy Kyle Show isn’t the only reality TV programme to be dogged with controversy. Take Love Island, for example in the past year two contestants who appeared on the show, Sophie Gradon and Mike Thalassitis, took their own lives.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAnd yet, Love Island endures, with the next series returning to ITV2 in a matter of weeks. Many are asking why perhaps the answer to the above question of whether ratings are worth lives is Yes.The finale of Love Island last summer attracted 3.6 million viewers. It’s a prime-time show, whereas Jeremy Kyle was on at breakfast. Love Island is full of beautiful, fit young people. Jeremy Kyle presented the lowest echelons of society as circus animals. Love Island is aspirational, top brands are showcased in the ad breaks. Jeremy Kyle was punctuated with adverts for payday loans and PPI claims.Has Jeremy Kyle been thrown under a bus, a sacrificial sop to offer evidence that the TV networks do take action, but allowing the more lucrative other reality shows to continue? Perhaps few people will mourn its passing, and we’re well shot of the embarrassing, vindictive, exploitative mess anyway.But really, social standing and personal grooming of those who appear on it aside, is there any great difference between The Jeremy Kyle Show and Love Island and however many other reality TV shows featuring members of the public you care to mention?Love Island,\u0026nbspBig Brother and the like are at their most popular when there’s confrontation, and anger, and back-stabbing and misery. Nobody wants to watch people sitting around and getting on famously over a nice cup of tea. We like arguments and meltdowns and drunkenness and blazing rows and flouncing off. We adore it when there’s a contestant to whose name we can add the prefix “Nasty”, we want to boo and hiss the pantomime villains who make the other people cry. In short, we love to hate, just like the several hundred-strong mob who followed Mrs Kirk home from the inquest in Hull almost 150 years ago.By axing Jeremy Kyle, ITV has accepted it must move with the timesDitching Kyle won’t stop us gawping when murder can be live-streamedJeremy Kyle Show permanently cancelled after death of guestAxe Jeremy Kyle’s ‘theatre of cruelty’ permanently, psychiatrists sayBut reality TV isn’t a pantomime. There might be similarities, for sure we know about “scripted reality”, and how situations are orchestrated by the production team. We know that stage directions are whispered in the ears of those appearing on tabloid talk shows — “She said this about you, what do you think of that?” – before they’re pushed on-stage, furious and out for blood. We know that the boring stuff goes on backstage, in the wings, away from the clean, flashy edit we see in front of us.But even the most booed and hissed pantomime villain wipes off their make-up and goes home at the end of the performance. Those ordinary people who appear on reality TV are merely dumped back in their lives, and the fall-out from what they’ve just endured can, as we’ve seen, prove too much.Perhaps three suicides from people appearing on TV shows heralds a turning point, and perhaps not, when there’s still money to be wrung out of the format. Time and time again during this piece I’ve referenced ancient Rome, with talk of gladiatorial combat on tabloid TV shows, describing Jeremy Kyle as a Caesar figure, mentioning “bread and circuses”, the phrase coined by the poet Juvenal to describe how government distracts the populace from scrutinising their work too much with palliatives of food and entertainment.Here’s another one, attributed to the ancient Roman judge Lucius Cassius, who was given to asking when dealing with cases, “cui bono?”In other words\u0026nbspwho profits? When it comes to reality TV I think we all know the answer to that.Support free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent MindsOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The material is said to include two of Assange’s manuscripts.His lawyers said an illegal seizure of property had been requested by the US, describing the country as “the agent of political persecution” against the WikiLeaks founder.Assange was dragged out of the embassy last month and is serving a 50-week prison sentence for bail violations.

Kristinn Hrafnsson, editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks, said: “On Monday Ecuador will perform a puppet show at the Embassy of Ecuador in London for their masters in Washington, just in time to expand their extradition case before the UK deadline on 14 June.“The Trump administration is inducing its allies to behave like it’s the Wild West,” she added.Baltasar Garzon, international legal coordinator for the defence of Assange and WikiLeaks, said: “It is extremely worrying that Ecuador has proceeded with the search and seizure of property, documents, information and other material belonging to the defence of Julian Assange, which Ecuador arbitrarily confiscated, so that these can be handed over to the agent of political persecution against him, the United States.Pamela Anderson visits Assange in jail, wearing ‘free speech’ blanket“It is an unprecedented attack on the rights of the defence, freedom of expression and access to information exposing massive human rights abuses and corruption. We call on international protection institutions to intervene to put a stop to this persecution.”Ben Brandon, the lawyer representing the US at a recent extradition hearing, said there were computer room chats showing real-time discussions between Chelsea Manning and Assange over an attempt to gain access to classified US documents.Earlier this week Swedish prosecutors announced they would reopen a 2010 rape case against the WikiLeaks founder.Additional reporting by PAOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A deduction is made from universal credit payments when claimants have outstanding debts with their utility companies or landlord, or when the DWP discovers they received a benefit overpayment at some point in the past.Universal credit claimants ‘left in dark about entitlements’Rising food bank use is a stark reminder universal credit has failedDWP kept ‘alarming’ universal credit findings secret for 18 monthsGovernment treating universal credit witnesses ‘like dirt’, say MPsDeductions\u0026nbspare also made\u0026nbspto pay off advance payments, which are offered to claimants when they first move onto the new benefit system to support them financially during the controversial five-week wait for universal credit. Currently there are around 850,000 claimants with an advance repayment in place.Martin Weaver, 42, who suffers from kidney disease and heart disease, has had money deducted from his universal credit entitlement every month since he started receiving the benefit after he was forced to give up with job as a hotel manager last July due to his illness.The father-of-two, who has to go to hospital three times a week for kidney dialysis, said he was surviving on beans on toast despite this being bad for his condition, and relying on charities to donate him basic things like a sofa and a washing machine.Shortly after he went onto universal credit last year, Mr Weaver, who has two sons aged five and three who stay with him three nights a week, was forced to move into an old caravan with just a small electric heater during the winter months. He recently moved into a home, but is left with less than £100 per month after rent.The 42-year-old, who lives in Scarborough, is seeing £50 withdrawn from his monthly allowance to pay off an advance payment he received when he first moved onto the benefit, as well as around £40\u0026nbspbeing deducted each month for previous debts and historic overpayments.“It’s awful. In the past month I’ve spent a week and a half in hospital. They say people should\u0026nbspcome off benefits and get a job. I literally can’t work because of my health at the moment,” he said.“I’ve been lucky to have been donated a kitchen table and chairs, a sofa, a double bed, an electric cooker and a washing machine from charities. It\u0026nbspdoesn’t feel good, nobody likes to do that, but desperation means there isn’t another option.“Every time the dietician\u0026nbspsees me she talks about the right things to eat, but in reality I just can’t afford them. Often I’m living on £30 a month for food.Surge in families begging for money online amid universal credit woes“My sons don’t understand the situation. Before they come round I make sure I save some money. I’ll go buy a pack of yoghurts and packs of crisps for them. It’s tough. Something has to change.”Ruth George MP, who obtained the figures through a parliamentary question, said she was “very concerned” by the figures, and that job centres, advice agencies and food banks were\u0026nbspall reporting deductions from universal credit as being “one of the main reasons for people not having enough income to get by”.The Labour MP for High Peak in Derbyshire, who is a member of the Work and Pensions Committee, said she was “particularly concerned” by the number of people with tax credit overpayments\u0026nbspbeing deducted.She cited separate\u0026nbspfigures showing\u0026nbsptwo-thirds of universal credit claimants who have transferred from tax credits have an overpayment to repay, averaging £1,500 per person.Currently, the maximum rate of deductions cannot normally exceed 40 per cent, but following pressure from campaigners to reduce this threshold\u0026nbspthe department has said that from October 2019\u0026nbspthis will be reduced to 30 per cent.“Even when capped at 40 per cent of the standard allowance, these deductions total £127 per month for a single person – almost £30 a week, and £200 per month – almost £50 per week for a couple,” Ms George said. \u0026nbsp“I believe that these amounts, deducted from an already low rate of universal credit, are a significant factor in the rise of people who are struggling to get by.”Last year, the biggest reason for a referral to a food bank was benefit payments not covering the cost of living, according to the\u0026nbspTrussell\u0026nbspTrust, the biggest food bank provider in the UK.Garry Lemon, director of policy and research at the charity, said the universal credit deductions were “pushing people deeper into crisis right at the very point when support is most needed”.He added: “Our benefits system was created to anchor people from being swept into poverty – so why is the government clawing back £1 in every £10 of universal credit that is paid to people most in need of our support?“If someone is receiving universal credit it’s because our system has decided they need some extra support right now. But even when people’s payments come through intact, all too often that sum is too small to scrape by on.”Universal credit to see 1.9 million people ‘lose £1,000 per year’Jess Leigh, policy and campaigns manager at disability equality charity Scope, said “financial shocks” caused by the deductions had a “massive impact” on the lives of disabled people.“This is one of a number of issues with universal credit which the DWP needs to focus on during the\u0026nbspupcoming trial of managed migration in order to deliver a welfare system which works better for disabled people,” she added.Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said universal credit was “throwing families into chaos right across the country”.\u0026nbsp“On top of facing a five-week wait for their first payment, the housing element is often so meagre that people struggle to afford some of the cheapest private rents without sacrificing basics. The result is parents making the impossible choice between paying the rent, heating or eating,” she said.“When the worst happens and families can’t keep up with bills, the government’s power to deduct so much from their allowance makes a miserable situation even more dire.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Fire rages on Ilkey Moor in West Yorkshire for the second time in a monthLulu (left) and Gulliver, two green sea turtles, are reunited after 8 months apart at Sea Life in BrightonChildren jump between balls in the new Children\u0027s Garden at Kew GardensThe London Fire Brigade said 10 fire engines and 70 firefighters had to tackle a blaze at a commercial building on the North Circular in Neasden, north LondonConservator Restorer Jim Mitchell with part of the bronze statue of William Wallace which is being returned to the National Monument in Stirling after undergoing vital restoration work.

The simple fact\u0026nbspright now is we do not have time do a People’s Vote before 31 October.“What would be undemocratic is to impose a no-deal Brexit on this country which there is not a mandate for.

For Britain in many ways it\u0027s been about party politics and personalities and many people seem to think that Britain would have got a much better deal if only they had a tougher prime minister.In my view that just is a fundamental misunderstanding of how the European Union operates.Theresa May’s ‘bold offer’ on Brexit is nothing to get excited aboutCorbyn \u0027in peril\u0027 if he \u0027betrays\u0027 Labour over Brexit referendumCorbyn says free movement \u0027open for negotiation\u0027 if Labour led talksNo-deal preparation to be ‘ramped up if MPs reject PM’s Brexit plans’Revoke Article 50 as no time for second referendum, says Change UK Taking aim at MPs, he added: There are many British politicians who don\u0027t, quite frankly, understand that or the complexity of politics in Northern Ireland and therefore they have tried to dumb this debate down into a simplistic argument whereby it\u0027s Britain versus the EU, as opposed to two friends tying to navigate through the complexity of a very, very difficult agreement.Mr Coveney also warned the UK should not assume another Article 60 extension will be granted by the EU if a deal is not in place by the revised 31 October deadline.No-deal preparation to be ‘ramped up if MPs reject PM’s Brexit plans’Major changes and challenges as a result of the European elections next week, he claimed, could mean the EU being prepared to devote less focus on Brexit going forward.

It’s in effect become an identity issue.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Counting will take place on Thursday, and official results are expected the same day.Four national surveys released as the last polling stations shut suggested Mr Modi’s right-wing, BJP-led coalition – the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) – had secured victory albeit with a reduced majority, from its 341 seats to between 280 and 315.The main opposition Congress party, which with 44 seats suffered the worst result in its history at the last election in 2014, was projected to secure 124 to 128 constituencies with the help of its allies.Will India’s ‘lawless state’ decide the fate of its general election?Exit polls in India have been badly wrong in the past and analysts warned there was likely to be a large margin of error this time round as well, such is the scale of the election with more than 900 million eligible voters.Among the last to cast their ballots were residents of several key seats in the populous bellwether state of Bihar, which was part of the so-called Hindi heartlands swept by the “Modi wave” of 2014.Distress among farmers and rising unemployment levels are seen as the biggest factors putting pressure on Mr Modi during the campaign, and the impoverished state has both a high percentage of rural voters and a poor track record of development.Outside a polling station at a village primary school in the farming district of Fatuha, 23-year-old Mantu Kumar told The Independent he\u0026nbspvoted BJP in the last election, but that he voted Congress this time round as Mr Modi’s pledge to create 20 million jobs had not materialised.“In 2014 there was a wave in favour of Modi – this time there is nothing like that,” he said. “Modi was a vote for change. We thought things would get better but they didn’t. When it comes to appearances he is good, but when it comes to his promises he has not delivered anything.”Stigma around women’s underwear creating a ‘petri-dish’ for diseaseMen’s rights activism on the rise in India in response to #MeTooPolling agent in India arrested ‘for telling women how to vote’India should have a coalition government – we’d be less fracturedGandhis face stern reelection test as India goes to pollsIn the expanding urban areas of Patna, the state capital, support for Mr Modi was much stronger, however. Voters here were as likely to talk about the prime minister’s record on national security – his number one talking point in the last five months of campaigning – as they were jobs and infrastructure.After a separatist militant killed 40 Indian soldiers in Pulwama, Kashmir, Mr Modi ordered India’s first air strikes on Pakistani soil in decades. Though the efficacy of the strikes has been questioned, there is no doubt the action he took has resonated well with his supporters.Outside Patna College, general store owner Sanjay Chandra, 38, said: “The country has grown stronger under Modi’s governance. The world has got the message thanks to Modi’s leadership that we too are a strong country.“I hope he delivers more for the people… but the most important issue is the terrorism in this country. Only Narendra Modi can tackle this.”While voting passed at a brisk pace and without any reports of clashes in Bihar, in neighbouring West Bengal police used batons to break up skirmishes between BJP supporters and those of the regional Trinamool Congress party on the outskirts of the state capital Kolkata. Several crude bombs were also exploded during the clashes, the police said.The state has seen the worst of the violent clashes throughout the election, as the BJP has pushed hard to make inroads ahead of expected losses of seats in other large states like Uttar Pradesh, with its 80 seats up for grabs, and Bihar itself. West Bengal sends 42 members to parliament’s lower house.Mr Modi visited West Bengal 17 times throughout the campaign, his visits in part provoking the sporadic violence that forced the Election Commission to cut off campaigning a day earlier than scheduled – a move analysts described as unprecedented.“There were long queues of people waiting patiently to cast their votes, which is a good sign for democracy,” he told the Associated Press.With his rhetoric against Pakistan and appeals to the BJP’s Hindu core, Mr Modi has been accused of failing to speak out in defence of India’s large Muslim minority. Incidents of violence against Muslims in the name of cow protection have increased, and Kashmiri Muslims faced a backlash across India in the wake of February’s Pulwama bombing.If the exit polls are correct and Mr Modi is indeed returning for a second term, voters like Shahla Hasan in the Muslim-majority Bhanwar Pokhar neighbourhood of Patna city were worried.But she is more worried about what she calls the rise of religious and caste ides on his watch. “Modi is anti-Muslim. Definitely. There is no doubt about it,” she told The Independent. “He talks about banning triple talaq, banning the burqa, banning loudspeakers in mosques.Final results will not be known until Thursday, when tallies from all states’ electronic voting machines will be counted and the official numbers released within a matter of a few hours. Amid uncertainty over the exit polls, the BJP may yet need to secure the support of more regional parties in order to claim a majority. A Congress-led government would require nothing short of a drastic electoral upset.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also co-owns a house in Surrey.Mishcon de Reya first hired him in  as a part-time consultant for its business crime unit.He quit client work for the firm in April , but was reappointed as a consultant to its in-house academy in June this year.The MP stood down from that role after being appointed to the shadow cabinet last month.Starmer is the third key figure from the lacklustre £.m Operation Elveden witchhunt of Sun reporters to be employed by Mishcon de Reya.His former principal legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service Alison Levitt and former politan police assistant commissioner Sue Akers – who headed the bungled investigation – have also done work for the firm.This week Starmer refused to apologise after reporter Anthony France had his conviction overturned - meaning not one of  Sun journalists arrested were convicted.A spokeswoman for the law firm said: “Keir Starmer was a consultant to the Mishcon Academy, our in-house centre for learning and development.“The role did not involve client advice on any issue. Keir resigned as a consultant to the academy when he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet.”A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The -year-old has a wise head on those young shoulders.She realises just how toxic s like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook can be and understands the long-term damage they cause.We are already in a very dark place when it comes to these s.This week there was the utterly heartbreaking story of a -year-old girl in Malaysia who took her own le after asking her social media followers whether or not she should do so.Appallingly,  per cent of her Instagram followers voted that she should kill herself. So she did.This young woman, with everything to live for, jumped off a high building in Sarawak, Borneo, and her le was snuffed out. Apparently the poor kid, who has not been named, had a history of depression and was clearly seeking some sort of help or validation via social media.Instead, some seriously sick and callous people encouraged her to die.This is the kind of appalling tragedy Selena is concerned about. She wants people to be more supportive of one another online and to spread kindness instead of cruelty and hatred.Selena has had a tough time of her own battling mental health problems after being struck down by lupus, a disease that attacks the immune system and which forced her to undergo a kidney transplant.She took a long break from Instagram and is now extremely careful about what she posts.Selena has spoken eloquently about the young fans she meets who talk to her about being bullied online and feeling powerless to defend themselves.I am so glad I grew up in a time before my mistakes would be posted for all to see on the internet.I would have been slaughtered on Twitter for my awkward early TV appearances.Instead, I was allowed to learn and improve without being made to feel like a failure.I have recently abandoned Twitter, as it had become exhaustingly toxic.I mostly use Instagram to post funny pictures of my beloved Border Terrier Angus, or details of my outfits on TV, simply because I get so many people asking which shop they come from.I occasionally receive some pretty horrid comments about my sense of style but I try to ignore them and not to be too hurt.This week I spoke to Leigh-Anne Pinnock of Little Mix.All four young women in the group have been bombarded with negative comments online ever since winning The X Factor in .They are vilied for their appearance and choice of clothes — and sadly, Leigh-Anne has been subjected to disgusting racism too.It’s been so tough for her and for bandmates Jesy, Jade and Perrie, leaving them upset and shaken. It has taken years for them to stop looking at social media and be strong enough to ignore corrosive comments.I happen to think some of their outfits are a bit risque and clearly I wouldn’t wear them myself — but so what  It is their choice andthey want to be a bit naughty and raunchy, they should go for it.I heartily applaud Selena and Leigh-Anne for speaking out and trying to limit the power of hideous trolls.We can’t all be like Piers Morgan, who is bombarded with negative and abusive comments but cheerfully retweets them, correcting the spelling and grammar of even the most appalling insults.We are not all so thick-skinned and, as Selena has pointed out, it’s too late to police social media effectively.Sadly it gives the sickest, most twisted and cruellest people a chance to inflict suffering and mental anguish on the rest of us.The message is simple: Be like Selina and Leigh-Anne. Ignore the trolls, don’t feed them — andyou feel you can’t live without social media, try to be positive and uplting.IF you are in need of an injection of sheer joy and happiness, download the  movie musical Calamity Jane and prepare to be enchanted by a le- affirming performance from the late, great Doris Day.At a time in Hollywood when women were either sex symbols or old maids, Doris gave an ass-kicking lead performance to make us laugh and cry, often in the same scene.Doris, who died this week aged , was a triple threat who could act, sing and dance to perfection. She moved with the greatest of ease from musical dramas like Love Me Or Leave Me and Young At Heart to the frothy comedies Pillow Talk and Move Over Darling.A class act who never felt the need to hang on to the spotlight, she was happy as a clam living in Carmel, Calornia, with her beloved pets, raising money to care for neglected animals.Doris will be sadly missed but what a legacy she leaves behind.GREAT to see top actor Stephen Graham finally getting the attention and praise he so richly deserves.He played a blinder in BBC’s Line Of Duty as a tortured undercover cop and is now burning up the screen in The Virtues on Channel  as a broken alcoholic.It’s an acting masterclass, completely believable and utterly authentic.Last weekend, Jodie Comer made a point of praising Stephen during her acceptance speech for the best actress gong at the Baftas.Jodie won for her mesmerising performance as assassin Villanelle in Killing Eve and was quick to say she owes Stephen a pint for all his support when she started acting.So not only an incredible performer but a kind-hearted and generous one too.We will see him on our screens later this year alongside the star of the new Warburtons adverts, Robert De Niro, as well as Al Pacino and Joe Pesci, in Netflix movie The Irishman, directed by Martin Scorsese.I guarantee Stephen will steal every scene he appears in. This is his golden time and no one deserves it more.ABORTION features currently on two of our TV dramas. In Emmerdale, Victoria Barton has been raped and is now pregnant.And in Holby City, it has been revealed that surgeon Ange was raped as a young woman and decided to go ahead with the pregnancy, keeping daughter Chloe.Both fictional characters have the right to choose what to do with their own bodies – something I firmly believe in.Right now in America, that choice has been taken away from real women living in the very conservative state of Alabama, where abortion has been banned altogether.This means a child, young girl or woman who is raped and discovers she is pregnant will have to go through with the birth.Evenshe is the victim of incest and repeatedly raped by a family member – father, brother or uncle – and is impregnated, she will not be able to have a termination.This is hideous, inhumane and deeply disturbing, especially as the draconian abortion ban is likely to spread into other US states.Right here and now in Alabama, doctors who perform abortions could go to prison for  years and the anti-abortion movement is gaining ground.On Thursday, the Republican-led senate in Missouri passed a Bill to ban abortions, this time at eight weeks. Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio and Georgia have already approved “heartbeat” abortion bans at just six weeks, when most women wouldn’t even realise they are pregnant.Louisiana, South Carolina and Tennessee are set to follow and in other states, legislation is being drawn up to make abortion either more dficult or completely impossible.Aside from some victims of rape and incest, no woman ever goes through with an abortion without suffering horrendous grief and anguish.It’s never a decision taken lightly and we simply cannot go back to the days when pregnant women and the medics who help them are treated like criminals.The US is going backwards at an alarming rate and these laws will simply drive terminations underground, putting women at severe risk of botched backstreet abortions that can maim for le or even kill.Shame on every legislator who helped pass these cruel laws.GOOD luck to Michael Rice, who takes to the stage in Tel Aviv desperately hoping not to come last in the Eurovision Song Contest.This is no reflection on his performance or the song Bigger Than Us, which is our best effort in years.It’s down to biased voting to punish the UK for all the Brexit b*****ks.On the surface, Eurovision is a screechingly hilarious fun-filled campfest to be applauded and enjoyed.But underneath, it’s horribly political and rather grubby.We could have Adele and Robbie Williams singing a duet and still come bottom of the heap, such is the depth of anti-British feeling.Michael wasn’t born the last time the UK won Eurovision, with Love Shine A Light by Katrina  The Waves in .Times have changed since those heady days and now anything other than the dreaded “nul points” will be a victory for young Michael.He’s philosophical about his prospects and determined to enjoy sharing the same stage as Madonna in front of the biggest audience of his career. I wish him well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And on those any leader will improve on the shameful paralysis under Theresa May. So for Tories it boils down to this:Who can best run rings around Corbyn and convince voters to cast him and his Marxist-Communist cronies back to the shadows  And who, by the next election, can lure back millions of Farage supporters by delivering a meaningful Brexit If Cabinet “soft Brexit” Remainers nostalgic for the Cameron era think they tick these boxes they are between delusional and unhinged. Brexit and the Corbyn menace changed everything.But Tory chairman Brandon Lewis will need to sort this far more rapidly than he expects. Mrs May MUST go immediately after her deal’s final defeat in early June — and Lewis must have her replacement in power by early July.Our future is on a kne-edge. The Tories must make the right choice . . . but fast.STILL they cannot or will not grasp it.Remainiac politicians and their pet journos are desperate to destroy Nigel Farage and to attribute his party’s soaring ratings to anything but the obvious.But no, it is not down to millionaire mates, Russian cash, “lies”, racism or any of the other conspiracy theories idiotic tinfoil-hatted hacks try to pin on him.We voted to leave the EU. We haven’t. And we haven’t changed our minds.The Tories have given up. Labour, as we long ago predicted, have finally caved to the second referendum brigade and, too late, become a Remain Party. The useless, vacuous Lib-Dems are hoovering up Remainer protest votes.But, guess what  A Brexit Party with a simple message and the best campaign leads polls everywhere but Scotland.For everyone outside Westminster’s Remoaner bubble, it’s not hard to see why.YET more proof the Tories lost their minds over the sugar tax they put on fizzy drinks.Scientists now say fruit juice, which was exempted, is just as bad for you because it often contains more sugar.Will the Government’s health zealots admit defeat and reverse their pointless tax on pop  Or stick a similarly punitive and ludicrous levy on orange juice We doubt it.

They should be used to their jaws dropping by now.Ever since they chopped off Ned Stark’s head in the first series — killing the hero just as this epic tale was getting started! — Game Of Thrones has always defied every story-telling convention. And that is exactly what has made it the greatest TV show of all time.Better than The Sopranos, better than Breaking Bad and better than our own Line Of Duty.I am afraid that dear old Ted sheepishly confessing to watching a bit of porn can’t compete with Daenerys Targaryen laying dragon-scorched waste to the city she had come to liberate.What gave GoT the edge over those modern masterpieces are all the truly shocking moments that were like being mugged in a King’s Landing back street.The Red Wedding. The fall of The Wall. Jaime throwing young Bran Stark from a tower. The dragon who was turned to the dark side.The Battle Of The Bastards. Ramsay Bolton being fed to his dogs. Cersei making all those religious fanatics go boom. Theon Greyjoy having his private parts chopped off. Cersei’s naked walk of shame. Melisandre, the buxom Red Priestess, ageing  years before your eyes.Arya Stark taking her revenge for the Red Wedding. Daenerys Targaryen walking into her husband’s funeral pyre and emerging as the mother of three baby dragons. Blimey!For my money George RR ­Martin, who wrote the brilliant books the HBO series is based on, is the world’s greatest living story-teller. And what really made the HBO series such unmissable are the shock tactics and startling twists that Martin loves.There are those who find Game Of Thrones too violent, too sexist, too sadistic.And they have a point. There were scenes — the prolonged torture of Theon, the burning of little Shireen Baratheon, any sexual contact with King Joffrey or Ramsay Bolton — where GoT seemed to revel in its own cruelty.But what ultimately makes Game Of Thrones so damn good is that you have absolutely no idea what is going to happen next.Many expect Arya Stark, inset, the doe-eyed killing machine, to assassinate Daenerys Targaryen in tomorrow’s episode. Perhaps. But you just never know with Game Of Thrones. Dany is just as likely to turn Arya to Stark-on-toast.Jon might marry his auntie. Sansa could reign. The Imp, Tyrion Lannister, could nick it.Personally, I thought the ice zombies would stick around until the final episode and that the Night King might eventually sit on the Iron Throne. How wrong can you be And that is why, for all the mouth-foaming moaning on social media, the final episode of GoT tomorrow night is the most anticipated TV event of all time.Because in those pitiless seven kingdoms, nobody is safe.THIS coming Thursday, the elections for the European Parliament give you the chance to give Labour and the Tories the kicking they so richly deserve.Because the two lying giants of British politics have treated you with total contempt.Both parties promised to honour the result of the Brexit referendum, brought about by the Brexit Party’s Nigel Farage, and the largest vote for anything in our history. They lied. Both parties voted for Article , the formal mechanism to take us out of the EU. They lied.Both the Tories and Labour put commitments in their manestos in the  General Election to honour the referendum. They lied.Our democracy has been degraded. Our people – the same people who fight their wars and pay their taxes – have been treated like thick peasants who should not be allowed to vote. The temptation to stay home on Thursday is strong.Why bother to vote for anythingyour vote is worthless  I understand that feeling.

She was still lying on the floor. The gentleman was trying to help her up – that’s when he was stabbed as well.”And no god is served. And no cause is furthered. And no injustice is avenged.

A columnist at the left-leaning New Statesman magazine described it as curating “a morbidly chaotic picture of a British underclass — for those watching at home to scoff and sneer”.Over at the self-appointed moral compass of Britain, , an editorial complained it preyed on “vulnerable, unhappy people”, turning “a blind eye to mental health problems”. writer Zoe Williams had previously claimed: “Jeremy Kyle has created the cultural spectre of this feral underclass, none of whom has the smallest amount of emotional restraint.”Such bile aimed at a show loved by so many — the final episode, on Friday last week, drew over a million viewers — reveals as much about Kyle as who our commentariat feel has the right to speak, and how they are meant to do it.Kyle’s cull comes at a time of unprecedented openness around personal and mental health issues — as middle-class public figures are lauded for sharing their private woes.Yet working-class people airing their issues on daytime TV find themselves derided.Perhaps Kyle’s guests didn’t speak with the right accent or wear the right clothes. They didn’t have impressive jobs or double-barreled names. They did not articulate themselves calmly, via book deals, or break down on Instragram with full faces of make-up.Rather than be celebrated for bravery, they are written off as dysal.Many of Kyle’s guests did not have mental health issues — they were normal people discussing their problems. There were estranged parents, people struggling to trust or dealing with addiction.Kyle gave real people a voice. Among those who have complained about experiences on the show, many have also said it helped them.Although judgmental about his guests’ actions, Kyle did not judge his guests. Open about his own problems, he believed his guests were as capable of turning their lives around as him. This is more credit than many commentators have given them.It’s offensive to hear Kyle’s adult guests written off as “vulnerable”, asincapable of deciding whether to appear. After  years, , episodes and  series, they would have known Kyle’s style. These were adults choosing to share stories on a  that mattered to them.It comes, of course, as royalty, showbiz celebrities and broadsheet columnists have been praised for publicly airing their personal problems. Never have we celebrated sharing these issues so loudly. When Prince Harry spoke of coming close to a breakdown, singer Will Young his struggle with anxiety and model Cara Delevingne her depression, people applauded.They belong to an industry of openness. Books chronicling personal struggles with mental health are being published to acclaim. Such as Susannah Cahalan’s memoir Brain On Fire, about her psychosis. Or Matt Haig’s memoir about depression, Reasons To Stay Alive. Documentaries such as Bake Off winner Nadiya Hussain’s this week, Anxiety And Me, are praised.Sharing such issues is important. Prince Harry, on his tour of Australia, spoke thoughtfully about how people “must not silently suffer” and must share problems because others “will relish the opportunity to listen or talk themselves”. Yet apparently all this admiration for openness does not extend to Kyle’s guests.Charles Walker complained they were “emotional”. This from a man commended for speaking about his OCD, which he said made him a “practising fruitcake”.Onewriter described Kyle’s guests as “delinquent children, tearaway teens, feckless fathers, long-term unemployed . . . alcoholics, junkies, the sexually insecure, the sexually confused, the sexually poly-amorous” — but could have been describing contributors to the paper’s blog Comment Is Free.District judge Alan Berg described Kyle’s show as “human bear-baiting” and “a morbid and depressing display of dysal people who are in some kind of turmoil”.Asyou couldn’t say the same about many in the House of Commons.The bile for Kyle contrasts, too, with praise of other reality TV — in particular, Love Island. Also aired on ITV, it has seen the suicide of two of its former contestants. Yet the show is celebrated. columnist Leah Green  praised how it “makes the complexities of British society so tangible they can’t be ignored”. Another column in the paper cheered it as “a place where liars and love rats get called out and prejudices are exposed.” It opined: “There is something to be gleaned here about friendship, race . . . and the way men and women communicate.”Perhaps such lessons are just more palatable when they come via men with tanned six-packs and women with perfect teeth.When I watched Kyle’s show I didn’t see a “feral under-class”. I saw people I know. I saw real le, which is messy, dysal and chaotic, which does not always come out in well-formed sentences, memoirs or documentaries made by people with posh accents for Radio .I didn’t watch Kyle to sneer. I watched with relief that some people were truly open about the madness of le. What happens to them now Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Labour leader insisted a second Brexit referendum would not be disastrous but said there should be something dferent for the public to vote on.Mr Corbyn has been criticised by Labour members and MPs who say Labour should come off the fence and back a second poll. And opinion polls show Labour have been hemorrhaging Remain votes to the Lib Dems in recent weeks. Although Labour sources insisted Mr Corbynaposs comments on the Andrew Marr show did not signy a change in policy, there was an undoubted sht in tone from the Labour leader. Mr Corbyn was repeatedly pressed for clarity over Labouraposs stance on Brexit with a series of conflicting views from shadow cabinet ministers presented to him.    Askedthe Labour election slogan was Vote Labour, get Brexit, Mr Corbyn told BBC Oneaposs The Andrew Marr Show: I think what would be a fair assessment would be to say Vote Labour, challenge austerity and guarantee living standards for the future, not a no-deal exit from the European Union which is all thataposs being offered by the Tory right and, in a sense, by the Tory party. The Opposition leader reiterated a second referendum should be an option on the table to respond to what emerges from Parliament, although added MPs have yet to reach agreement.  Mr Corbyn was pushed on what he meant when saying option, to which he replied: We would want a vote in order to decide what the future would be, so yes. Askeda second referendum would be disastrous, Mr Corbyn replied: No, I donapost think anything like that is disastrous but I think it has to be an opportunity for public debate and public discussion, but it has to be about something and thataposs why I have made the point clear about a customs union and trade and rights protection. His comments were immediately seized upon by Labour remainers as a sign that the party is moving towards a clearer backing for a second referendum.Lord Adonis said on Twitter :Jeremy Corbyn has just said on Marr that any Brexit deal should be put to a referendum with an option to remain Labour is unequivocally the party for Remain - and the only party that can stop Farage and stop Brexit!  Paul Mason also tweeted saying: Corbyn made a clear change of emphasis onMarr - saying Labour would put even a good deal ie *its own* to a second referendum...The Labour leader also said freedom of movement would be part of any negotiations with the EU led by his party in a bid to help workers.  Mr Corbyn said he is not staunchly against freedom of movement, before adding: Our manesto said the European system would not applyyouaposre not in the European Union - but I quite clearly recognise there has to be a lot of movement of workers. Ask any company in manufacturing or any other sector how much they need and rely on workers from Europe and indeed the other way around. Told there are countries outside the EU which have chosen to retain free movement, Mr Corbyn said: That would be part of our negotiations with the EU. He added: Part of our negotiations, the extent to which workers would transfer from one country to the other and what the needs for it would be. AskedLabour would keep free movement as a non-member of the EU, Mr Corbyn replied: It would be open for negotiation the level of movement of people between Europe and this countryweaposre a non-member of the EU. He added Labour does not currently support legislation to implement the Governmentaposs Withdrawal Agreement as he has heard nothing which suggests it will be fundamentally any dferent to what was previously put forward.  Talks between the Conservatives and Labour to try and break the Brexit deadlock collapsed last week, with Mr Corbyn reiterating they have concluded and the Government hasnapost changed its red lines.   But today Theresa May said she was making a “bold offer” to MPs in a final attempt to get her beleaguered Brexit deal through Parliament and onto the statue book before she leaves office.She is expected to bring back the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to the Commons in the week beginning June . Mr Corbyn said as it stood Labour would not be supporting it.  We havenapost seen whatever the new Bill is going to be yet but nothing Iaposve heard leads me to believe itaposs fundamentally any dferent to the previous Bill thataposs been put forward, so as of now weaposre not supporting it, he said. Mr Corbyn earlier also played down the prospect of future indicative votes on Brexit proposals, noting: I think itaposs unlikely that it will actually take us much further forward. I think the Government has to come up with legislation through negotiation with the EU.

The union fears that a low turnout next Thursday could allow the likes of Mr Yaxley-Lennon,also known as Tommy Robinson, to sneak in and get elected to the European Parliament.Turnout in the last European elections in the North West was just  per cent and in , with turnout just below  per cent, Nick Grfin, the former leader of the far-right BNP, was elected with little more than  per cent of the vote.The region currently has eight MEPs - three Labour , three former UKIP and one each for the Tories and the Lib Dems. The adverts feature ious slogans, including ‘we will fight them at the ballot box’ which invokes Winston Churchill’s famous ‘we will fight them on beaches’ quote. Others feature a graphic of a crossed box on a polling card with the words aposthis weapon destroys the far rightapos and aposyou have the power to stop the far-rightapos.

But when poor health made it dficult for her to do her job, she decided it was time for a change. ‘I loved the job, but I was finding it harder to restrain and control the patients, so sadly I had to retire from it at the age of ,’ says Antonella, known as Nelly to her friends. ‘I got a job in a GP surgery as a receptionist, which was far more relaxed, but a casual conversation with my best friend ended up changing my le.’ In , a new trend hit the big time on Facebook. Nelly noticed a lot of her friends selling and reviewing products to make some extra money.    ‘They were like online Avon ladies. Juice Plus, Botox in a bottle – you name it, one of my Facebook friends was trying to flog it. ‘But I’d watch these videos and get bored. ‘If someone was trying a face mask, they’d sit there and wait for it to set, and I thought, “Why aren’t they telling a story or something ” ‘I was so bored out of my brains, I forgot what they were selling in the first place!’ With a big personality and a no-nonsense attitude, Nelly thought she could do a better job. The ‘hot’ product at the time was a lip gloss that gave your lips a plumped effect, so she bought herself one and gave it a go. ‘I said to my friend, “Let’s buy one each, try it, film it on our phones, stick it on Facebook, and whoever gets the most likes gets p.” ‘Well, she still owes me p – people seemed to really enjoy it. ‘They said I was funny and asked me to do another. ‘I was only working part-time at the GP surgery and my daughter Olivia [now ] was off to university, so I thought, “Why not ”’    It was then that things escalated in an unexpected way. ‘I decided to buy and try a celebrity exercise DVD, because it’s one of those things we all buy and never, ever use. ‘Well, this particular one was a total wind-up, it was impossible. ‘It was the most honest exercise review I think anyone has probably ever done. ‘It got shared amongst my friends and within days I had  million views. ‘It went viral, I had more viewers than the BAFTAs that year, and was the most watched person on the internet in February .’ Instant stardom Shocked, Nelly realised she was on to something. With just her iPhone to record on and little internet knowledge, she bought a small tripod and started buying and reviewing anything, from sponges, foot-long sausage rolls, porridge as shampoo and even a Shewee . Within six weeks, Facebook had veried her as an official ‘brand’ and she gained millions of fans worldwide.  ‘I call everyone Flower anyway, so I’ve officially named my fans The Flowerpots,’ says Nelly. ‘They send me messages online, asking me to review things for them because they know I’ll be honest. ‘If I don’t like it, I’ll say so, and I’m happy to buy and try, so no one wastes their money. ‘My only rule is that it has to be affordable. ‘A lot of people have asked me to review the Dyson hairdryer, but I haven’t got  quid to spend on a bl**dy hairdryer. ‘That’s my rent and council tax! ‘But that’s why I can always be honest and non-biased, because I’ve bought everything myself.’ Now, two years on, Nelly’s personality has opened many doors. Fans took to her warm, approachable nature and began to ask for advice on relationships and personal issues, so she started filming a ‘Sunday Service’, where she gives her honest advice. Off the back of that she’s been hired as an agony aunt for two magazines, and when her salary reached six figures, she started her own Curvy Couture boutique. ‘It is mad to think how I’ve been able to make such le-changing money,’ she says. ‘If people want to buy what I’ve reviewed, they follow the link to Amazon andthey purchase, I get some commission from the seller. ‘Some months I’ll make £, others it might be £,, but often when I post a review, it becomes Amazon’s best-selling product that day,’ she says proudly. ‘Weirdly, the items I say are rubbish always do well.’  A perfect example of that was when Nelly decided to try the Aurora Band, a sleep-in head band which promises to give you amazing curls in the morning, and had recently been featured on Dragons Den. ‘I have very long hair and it didn’t work for me at all,’ she explains. ‘It got so tangled, when I took it off I looked like Hagrid. ‘It went huge in America because they all love Harry Potter, and even celebrities like Cardi B,  Cent and Charlie Sheen shared my video! ‘Sales went through the roof because people wanted to see for themselves how rubbish it was. ‘When I tell people not to bother clicking the link to buy, they always sell out. ‘People are just daft,’ she laughs. But having such an honest online reputation isn’t going to please everyone, and Nelly often receives feedback from businesses that want a scathing review taken down. ‘The woman who designed the Aurora Band called me and said it hadn’t worked because my hair was too long. ‘I said that needed to be on the box, then. It was good feedback for her. ‘She should have thanked me because the sales went up so much. ‘I was asked to try the Ta-Ta Towel [a handy device to help women with larger busts avoid the dreaded under breast sweat], but it was £.. ‘I found one on Amazon for two quid so I tested that instead, even though the inventor wanted it taken down. ‘I told her to stay in her lane and stay out of mine.’  Still doing reviews , she now gets recognised everywhere she goes and has fans contacting her from all around the world. ‘Leigh Francis recognised me at a charity event – I nearly wet my knickers! ‘I had a little girl come and see me in my shop, saying she liked my videos, so I told her not to swear like I do. ‘And recently I had an -year-old lady tell me I made her laugh every day and had brought light to her le since her husband died. That melted my heart. ‘Not to mention the amount of date offers I get, but I’m still single. ‘These men wouldn’t look twice at me in the street, so I have to be careful.’  Down to earth She might be living le in the public eye, but Nelly makes sure she stays grounded. Still shopping at the local market, she insists she hasn’t changed her lestyle. ‘As a single mum in a council house, I’ve always gone without so my daughter had everything she needed. I’ve had nothing. ‘But now it’s lovely to be able to take her shopping and know that no matter what the bill is, I can afford it. ‘Knowing I can help Oliviashe ever needs it is priceless. ‘Money doesn’t bring you happiness, but it makes things easier.’ With hundreds of requests rolling in daily and endless offers to spread joy and humour at ious events, it seems Nelly’s here to stay. ‘Opportunities don’t come up for average women like me at my age, so I had to grab the bull by the horns. ‘Plenty of people don’t like me and I just think, “Don’t waste what could be your last day on God’s Earth watching me, then. Do something you like!” ‘It’s an abundance of fun and I’ve had a ball. So as long as people want me around, I’ll be here.’ ● Follow Antonella The Uncensored Reviewer on YouTube and Facebook "},{"url":null,"title":"senior tory blasts power hungry","story":"NewsSenior Tory blasts power-hungry MPs campaigning for leadership amid Brexit chaosA host of candidates have already unveiled their pitches for No, with Boris Johnson the runaway favouriteShareByBen GlazeDeputy political editorNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsThe defence minister had stern words for his Tory colleagues \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA senior Tory blasted power-hungry colleagues for campaigning for the party leadership while the country is mired in brexit chaos. A host of candidates have already unveiled their pitches for No, with Boris Johnson the runaway favourite. But Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood told Sky News: “This isn’t a TV reality contest.”He went on: “Let’s have some loyalty, let’s have some commitment, let’s have some discipline in focusing on the one thing that we need to get across the line, which is Brexit .The idea that we jump ahead and start toying around with who should be the leader... I do urge my colleagues to think why are they putting their name forward  Is it to raise their own profile - and some colleagues as well are changing their views in order to woo our membership to raise their profile as well.  This is getting things in the wrong order. Our focus must be to get Brexit across the line.”It comes as Theresa May prepares to make a “bold offer” to MPs in a final attempt to get her beleaguered Brexit deal through Parliament and onto the statue book before she leaves office.Writing in The Sunday Times, Mrs May said: I still believe there is a majority in Parliament to be won for leaving with a deal.    When the Withdrawal Agreement Bill comes before MPs, it will represent a new, bold offer to MPs across the House of Commons, with an improved package of measures that I believe can win new support. Whatever the outcome of any votes, I will not be simply asking MPs to think again. Instead I will ask them to look at a new and improved deal with fresh pairs of eyes - and to give it their support. Mrs May has said she will bring the Withdrawal Agreement Bill before MPs for its second reading vote in the first week of June following the short Whitsun recess. Cross-party talks collapsed on Friday with both sides blaming the other for their breakdown. Meanwhile, Tory grandee Michael Heseltine said he will vote Lib Dem in Thursday’s European election. In an article for the Sunday Times, he said: “Brexit seeps its poison into every family, age group, class and region.  Parliament itself is a mirror image of national disunity.  None of us can escape from what is without question the transcending issue of our time.”The former deputy Prime Minister, who has no intention of resigning his membership of the party or the Conservative whip in the House of Lords, says he will vote for the Liberal Democrats in the European parliamentary elections.This is because their lead candidate in his region is Bill Newton Dunn, a former Tory MEP who he describes as representing the best pro-European “traditions of Winston Churchill, Harold Macmillan and, yes, Margaret Thatcher”.

As part of the plans, men who attend a nearby mosque were reportedly invited to use the aisle of the parish church in Darlington as a place of prayer. Muslim women were also offered space in adjoining rooms of St Matthew and St Luke’s church, it is claimed. The proposals are said to have been discussed in a meeting on May  and attended by the Reverend Lissa Scott.    It is also claimed members were told that a devotional image of Jesus,  a copy of The Light of the World by the pre-Raphaelite artist William Holman Hunt, would be covered up, reports The Sunday Times . The newspaper reported that minutes from the meeting read: One aisle in church to be cleared of chairs for Muslim men to say prayers. Cover Christian crosses  photographs in small rooms for ladies to say prayers. The Diocese of Durham has since intervened in the fiasco and told the church it must not hold Islamic prayers in the church building. It stated that church law does not permit acts of worship by non-Christians in a Church of England building.    Christian Episcopal Church Bishop Gavin Ashenden, a former chaplain to the Queen, is among those to slam the plans. He said: When Muslims come into our church, we invite them to come in and respect Jesus. If we accepted an invitation to go into a mosque, we would respect Muhammad. Speaking of the Dioceseaposs decision to get involved, he added to Premier: They realise that the vicar made a silly mistake, but Iaposm glad it happened because it was raises in the public eye some important issues which people need to work through. Islam and Christianity are not Abrahamic cousins in Middle Eastern religion. Theyaposre actually antithetic to each other.    It is understood the event will go ahead, but prayers will be said where. In a statement to Premier, a spokesperson for the Diocese of Durham said: While it is vital to build good interfaith relations, it is clear that an act of worship from a non-Christian faith tradition is not permitted within a consecrated Church of England building. This is a legal position outlined in Canons B   and B Section  where it states: ‘all forms of service used under this Canon shall be reverent and seemly and shall be neither contrary to, nor indicative of any departure from, the doctrine of the Church of England in any essential matter’. There seems initially to have been some misunderstanding locally of this, but that has been resolved now, with plans for Muslim Prayers to be held in a nearby building then the whole community coming together for a celebratory meal inside the church. St Matthew and St Luke’s church has been contacted for a comment.

Dr Keith Wolverson, , was working at Royal Stoke University Hospital clinic last June when he asked the mother to remove her niqab - a veil worn by some Muslim women that covers their face apart from the eyes. Dr Wolverson said he asked her to do so when he, the mother, and her daughter were in the privacy of the hospital consulting room, as he had dficulty hearing the mum explain her daughteraposs symptoms. She willingly agreed to the doctoraposs request, he added.    However, after the womanaposs husband arrived an hour later, she complained to hospital staff about the exchange. The pair later wrote to the General Medical Councilto lodge a formal complaint. Dr Wolverson received a letter last week from the GMC informing him that he would be subject to an inquiry over the coupleaposs allegations of racial discrimination. The probe could see him struck off the medical register as a result, despite having an unblemished record his  year long career. The Daily Mail reports that Dr Wolverson will step down regardless of the outcome of the investigation. I feel a major injustice has taken place. I absolutely no longer want to be a doctor.    This country will have no doctors leftwe continue to treat them in this manner. I’m deeply upset. A doctor’s quest to perform the very finest consultation for the safety of the patient has been misinterpreted in a duplicitous manner to suggest there has been an act of racism committed. The GP has insisted he was just trying to do his job properly during the consultation in question. He said he found it dficult to understand what the woman was saying behind her veil and politely asked her to remove it as he needed to hear what was wrong. The doctor also insisted he is not racist and the incident is nothing to do with race, religion or skin colour. The furious GP said he has treated many Muslim patients and never had a problem when he asked women to remove their veil. According to the complaints received by GMC, the mother said she felt “victimised and racially discriminated” against during the consultation.    She said Dr Wolverson had demanded her to remove the veil, even though she refused to take it off due to religious reasons. She claims the GP said he would not continue the consultation until she removed her niqab, saying he was rude and gave her a dirty look. Mohammed Shafiq of the Ramadhan Foundation said Dr Wolverson’s action was “offensive”, and said that a female member of staff could have been asked to help on that occasion. Speaking to the Sun Online, he said that any stronger sanction would be unfortunate, and insisted Dr Wolverson be put on a ersity awareness course to deter future incidents from happening again. Joyce Robins, from Patient Concern, said losing a doctor over such an incident would be “criminal”. She told the Sun Online : “A doctor needs to be sensitive to a patient’s religion but safety must always come first.” Human rights campaigner Aisha Ali-Khan tweeted her support for the embattled GP. I donapost believe doctor should be prosecuted for doing his job *but* he should have asked for a female third party to help, or asked patient to write down her medical complaints, she posted. In a second tweet, Ali-Khan said she would personally write to the GMC about the complaint. I truly hope Dr Keith Wolverson is not struck off by GMC- he did nothing wrong  was only doing his job. I will be writing a letter to GMC to that effect.

The arts and travel director, , who is the daughter of the Queenaposs cousin, Prince Michael of Kent, exchanged vows at Windsor Castle in a stunning ceremony attended by the Queen and her family - minus Kate and William. It has been a long-held tradition among the Royals for brides to aposborrowapos a headpiece to wear on their big day - and Lady Gabriella, who is known to pals as Ella, was no dferent. She dazzled in an exquisite Russian Fringe- style tiara also worn by her grandmother Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, and mother Princess Michael of Kent, on their wedding days. But how does it compare to other royal brideaposs tiaras, including Kate, Meghan and Eugenieaposs   Usually there is huge sentimental value behind the tiaras - and not to mention numerous dazzling jewels worth millions of pounds. When Princess Eugenie glided down the aisle of St Georgeaposs Chapel in October, it was not only her dress that made her look every inch the perfect bride - but also her stunning diamond and emerald tiara. At Meghan and Harryaposs Windsor Castle wedding last May, the now Duchess of Sussex stunned in a bandeau diamond tiara, made in  for Queen Mary. And on Kate Middletonaposs wedding day on April  in , she dazzled in a stunning Cartier Halo tiara. Deborah Papas and Ailsa Russell, gemologists and jewellery experts from Prestige Pawnbrokers, who found fame on Channel  show Posh Pawn, have revealed how much they think the tiaras are worth. The most expensive one - thought to be worth up to £m - may surprise you. Kate Middletonaposs tiara - estimated price: £, - £,,  Kate Middletonaposs tiara was loaned to her by the Queen and signied the time-honoured custom of wearing something borrowed on her wedding day on April ,  at Westminster Abbey. It was made in  for the Queen Mother by Cartier, from diamonds and platinum, before being passed to the Queen as a birthday present. It features  baguette-cut diamonds as well as an astounding  brilliant cut diamonds of ying weights. The Queen Mother, who was gted the tiara by her husband, was only ever pictured wearing it once.  The tiara was later given to the Queen, then Princess Elizabeth, by her mother on her th birthday in . Her Majesty has not worn this piece very often, which used to be known as the Scroll tiara, but she did loan it to her sister Princess Margaret on several occasions. It was made famous again in , when Kate wore it for her wedding. Although itaposs not the grandest of crowns from the royal jewellery vaults, itaposs become iconic because of Kate. Deborah told the Express : “It is very hard to estimate the value but as a Cartier piece, I would estimate it to be worth approximately £, - £,,.” Lady Gabriella Windsoraposs tiara - estimated price: £,, - £,,    Beaming bride Lady Gabriella Windsor teamed her bespoke wedding grown by Italian designer Luisa Beccaria with the gorgeous Kent City of London Fringe Tiara. The stunning gems sparkled beneath her veil as she arrived at Windsor Castle. The timeless tiara was previously worn by her grandmother Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, and mother Princess Michael of Kent, on their wedding days in  and , so has huge sentimental value behind it. Ailsa Russell Gemologist and Appraiser Prestige Pawnbrokers of Channel ’s Posh Pawn told Express: “This beautul Russian inspired diamond set gold and silver tiara originally belonged to Princess Marina of Kent, gted before her wedding to the Duke of Kent in . “Welcoming the Greek and Dutch Princess to the country it was gted to her by the City of London. It was worn by Princess Alexandra on her wedding day and has become another icon of the Royal Kent family collection of jewels.” Hatton Garden jeweller and diamond expert Thelma West added: Gabriella looks radiant in a Russian Fringe Style Diamond Tiara, tagged the Kent City of London Fringe Tiara.  The gold and silver diamond set tiara features sparkling fringes sitting on a solid base and its sparkles can be seen through Gabriella’s veil. Another tiara which Gabriella could’ve worn is the Kent Pearl Festoon Tiara which was another favourite of her motheraposs. Both tiaras were inherited by Prince Michael of Kent in  when Princess Marina, Dutchess of Kent died. Gabriella has followed in the footsteps of recent Royal Brides who borrowed headpieces from the Queenaposs vast collection. The piece, unsurprisingly, has a grand price tag to match its history. Alisa said: “Likely featuring over cts of diamonds, a diadem of this provenance and importance would likely reach £million- £million.” Meghan Markleaposs tiara - estimated price: £,,    The now Duchess of Sussex opted to style her glossy hair into a low chignon, and finished the look with a statement lace veil and a gorgeous English tiara for her wedding to Prince Harry on May ,  at Windsor Castle. The veil was held in place by the bandeau diamond tiara, which was made in  for Queen Mary. The band was created with diamonds and platinum in  sections, and pierced with ovals. The centre of it is set with a detachable broach, dating from , and is crafted with ten brilliant diamonds. The brooch was given to the then-Princess Mary for her wedding to Prince George. The beautul piece was lent to Meghan by the Queen herself, who was left the bandeau and broach by Queen Mary in . Itaposs thought that this particular tiara hasnapost been seen since , when  Princess Margaret  wore it.    Meghan previously said of the tiara: When it came to the tiara on the day, I was very fortunate to be able to choose this gorgeous art deco style bandeau tiara. Harry and I had gone to Buckingham Palace to meet with Her Majesty The Queen to select one of the options that were there, which was an incredibly surreal day as you can imagine. And that [tiara] was one that, I think, as we tried them on, stood out... However it was claimed there was a row over the tiara. An unnamed source told The Sun that Meghan wanted to wear an emerald-encrusted tiara, but the Queen said no.  The source said: Meghan had her heart set on this tiara with emeralds and Prince Harry hit the roof when they were told it was impossible for her to wear it. There was a very heated exchange that prompted the Queen to speak to Harry. She said, aposMeghan cannot have whatever she wants. She gets what tiara sheaposs given by meapos. Meanwhile, Deborah told the Express: It is hard to put a value on this little seen piece but could be worth up to £ million. “It is set with a large brilliant cutdiamond estimated to be approximately  carats or more and surrounded by nine smaller brilliant-cut diamonds . There is a cluster either side also of seven round diamonds and an array of additional round brilliant-cut diamonds all over this  jointed art-deco piece.” Princess Eugenieaposs tiara  - estimated price: £,, - £,,  For her ceremony at St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor Castle on October , , Eugenie opted to wear The Greville Emerald Kokoshnik tiara, owned by  the Queen. The stunning item was made by Boucheron for Margaret Greville in  in a style popularised by the Russian Imperial Court. Mrs Greville was a close friend of Queen Mary and before her death, she bequeathed all her jewels to  The Queen Mother,  including a diamond necklace thought once to have belonged to Marie Antoinette, a pair of diamond chandelier earrings, a ruby necklace and the tiara.

The Queenaposs granddaughter specically requested a low back on her custom-made gown by Peter Pilotto to show the scar . Deborah said: “In keeping with the fashion of the time, this tiara was designed in the Russian headdress style, made of finely pierced platinum, which was kept delicately simple, although intricate in detail, to show off the main stone.  “Accompanying the centre emerald are matching old step-cut emeralds, as well as ample pave set brilliant and rose cut diamonds. “This piece is certainly exquisite the centre emerald has a wonderfully vivid colour and large size, something which is rare to find these days. “With such strong historical provenance, from Mrs Greville to the Queen Mother, and now the Queen, an elegant jewel such as this would be estimated to fetch in the region of £- million at auction.” "},{"url":null,"title":"im not gonna like rabbit","story":"NewsIm not gonna be like a rabbit on ya - sex for rent landlords vile wordsUndercover video exposes sleazy landlord exploiting young women for sex in exchange for a roof over their heads - and hes not the only oneShareCommentsByRachel LangAmy Sharpe:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video exclusive-sex-rent-landlord-exposed-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShocking undercover footage has revealed how sordid landlords are preying on young women - asking for sex infor free rent. One sex-for-rent landlord, aged in his mid s, met the Sunday Peopleaposs undercover reporter in Hove, East Sussex, to offer to share his one-bed flat. In a series of sickening messages he told her he would expect sex three times a week instead of rent. “Be like my gf or you can pay ­between £ £ to rent a flat. “I just want fun and horizontal exercise. Will u make luv with me Believing she was , he also demanded the undercover reporter send him “sexy” photos prior to meeting, telling her: “I want to see what I’m getting.”When she arrived for their  minute meeting, he attempted to lure her into his car to “show her the area”.    She refused. Iaposm giving you a roof over your head for nothing and asking for a little bit in , he said, before going into further details about what their aposarrangementapos would be. It donapost mean we are shagging every night. Itaposd be nice to have some cuddles, intimacy like couples do. Itaposs not gonna be every day - Iaposm not gonna be like a rabbit on ya. The man also insisted he wasnapost an a*****e and claimed eight other girls were vying for the room, and what they were offering him was unbelievable.    He added that they were absolutely begging him to take them on as a sex tenant. The lurid video shines a light on the exploitation that some women face in the hunt for a safe, secure space to live - despite the practice being outlawed in Janurary. Section  of the Sexual Offences Act  – ­causing or inciting ­prostitution for gain – can now be ­interpreted to include sex for rent landlords.  Anyone convicted could face up to seven years in jail. So far there have been no convictions. Despite the lack of convictions, the Sunday People were able to find ­dozens of sex for rent ads this week on the Craigslist website.  The phenomenon was ­further exposed when the Sunday Mirror met three men each demanding sex for a room last March. One in Loughborough, Leics, said rent, internet and TV are ­included in the deal, writing: “It’s all free only thing you need to buy is your own food. InI ask for sexual favours.” Another, in Notting Hill, West London, quizzed our reporter on her intimate experiences and said: “The rent is in an ­alternative form, sex three times a week. What are your limits sexually ” Both demanded naked snaps for the “application ­process”. A “couple in their s” offering a room for sex in Sittingbourne, Kent, said: “Apologies. It’s slightly dodgy. Free room for you infor joining us in the bedroom occasionally, around once a week.”    Another  - who compared ­himself to Fty Shades of Grey hunk Christian Grey – claimed to be looking for a female who would ­“submit” to him. He asked: “Have you ever been taken by twomen at the same time, tied up, ­restrained, spanked, whipped, ­blindfolded, had ­nipple clamps ” In April last year, a court heard how ­landlord Mamun Rashid, , used rental site Spare Room to lure three women to his flat in East London.    He offered them sex for rent and raped them when they refused. Rashid, was jailed for  years. Homeless charity Centrepoint warned despite a change in the law, “informal” sex for rent remains commonplace. Its Head of Public Affairs Paul Noblet said: “No young person should find themselves having to resort to such an arrangement. But in reality we know young people can take desperate measures to find themselves a bed for the night. “Formal arrangements in which sex is exchanged for payment in the form of free rent are illegal. But we know informal arrangements still take place. “This practice cannot truly be stamped out until the Government is able to ensure that every young person facing homelessness is able to access safe housing.”    Shelter chief executive Polly Neate added: “Too many women feel backed into a corner because of extortionate private rents, little protection against eviction and lack of social housing. While the police should undoubtedly take all illegal behaviour seriously, we also need to see changes that put renters in the driving seat. “The Government’s plan to abolish no-fault evictions must become law quickly so fewer renters are forced into these horric situations in the first place. And in the future, building a new generation of safe, stable social homes would mean more people can actually afford a decent place to live, putting the brakes on sex for rent for good.” The CPS said it is not aware of any prosecutions as a result of the new guidance issued earlier this year. It added: “Case studies which appear to show people seeking to sexually exploiting others in so called sex-for-rent agreements are clearly disturbing. “That’s exactly why earlier this year, we strengthened our guidance for prosecutors in this area to help bring offenders to justice. “The CPS is demand led and can only consider cases referred to us by the police.” Craigslist has been contacted for comment but did not respond.

David Haines, , was snatched at gunpoint by Islamic terrorists in  before being executed by the sick gang  months later. Just hours earlier before his abduction he sent a text to his daughter Bethany, , asking: Hey there darling, hope youaposre okay. Iaposm fine working away in Turkey. Hope you are feeling better now love dad. Bethany was initially shielded from details about Davidaposs ordeal and murder by her mum. But she has now learned the full story about her dadaposs imprisonment from his fellow aid worker Federico Motka.    Bethany said: Federico was the first person who was completely honest with me the whole time. I just wanted  per cent honesty, because up until then I had not been told the full truth. That conversation with him gave me a lot of closure. He was a straight-up guy - the same way my father was. When people tell me Iaposm a lot like my dad, I used to always think I donapost believe it. When [Federico] says, aposOh youaposre so much like your dad,apos it really does ring true   and I think, well, I must be doing something right.  Security expert David was working for French charity the Agency for Technical Co-operation and Developmentwhen he was abducted in March . He and Italian colleague Federico were pulled out of their car at gunpoint by masked men they later nicknamed the Beatles because of their English accents. Despite only having met four days earlier the two men quickly became firm friends as they endured torture, beatings and sleep deprivation. While in prison they were forced to fight two other Western hostages, American journalist Jim Foley and the British photographer John Cantlie, in a WWE style aposRoyal Rumbleapos. Federico explained: They had Dave and me in one corner, and John and James in the other, and they wanted us to fight.  We obviously werenapost going to fight each other, but you kind of couldnapost not fight each other as there was potential for punishment. You have to understand we were like skeletons by then, and every one of us fainted at some stage or another just from exhaustion. So, we werenapost exactly hurting each other. But [our captors] found it highly entertaining. At one stage the pair were held with  other western hostages, including American journalists Foley and Steven Sotloff, British aid worker Alan Henning, US aid worker Peter Kassig and British photographer Jim Cantlie. Federico told Bethany how the hostages told stories about their past and gave mini lectures on their hobbies to pass the time. They also constructed primitive chess pieces from cheese cartons and olive pits. He added: We drew a lot of strength from each other. The games allowed us to escape inside a world that we created for ourselves, and itaposs the same with the talks.  James talked about literature, Steve talked about American sports, John spoke about motorcycles. You know, everyone had their own passion. These guys arenapost just people or friends: theyaposre brothers. I think I spent more time sleeping next to David than any girl at that point in my le. Me and David had built up a particular relationship because we were caught together, because we went through everything together. Foley, Sotloff, Henning and Kassig were beheaded while Cantileaposs fate remains unknown. Federico was freed by Isis after  months in captivity when the Italian government reportedly paid a £ million ransom. But the British government refused to pay and David was beheaded by Londoner Emwazi in September . The cold-blooded murder was filmed and posted online.  Bethany met Federico the following month when a memorial service for her father was held in his native Scotland. They have gone on to become great friends and remain in regular contact. Bethany explained: Federico and I were kind of forced together through this...Getting to know him has been a really great experience for me. Federico added: I definitely see a lot of David in her. Which is a wonderful thing I guess ... to know that part of David lives on. Bethany may travel to war-torn Syria this summer to find Davidaposs remains and bring them back to Scotland. She said: I miss my father. I miss walking by the river with him. All he wanted was to help people and he paid for it with his le. I decided that in the summer I would launch a campaign and appeal to anyone who may have information about my fatheraposs remains. Evenit meant going over to Syria to look for them myself.

David Holden gets by with only the most basic of amenities a single bed, a gas stove and few personal items. He sleeps on a mattress in the back of his van, earning money moving students into homes he says he could not afford himself.But for David he would never want it any other way - and something that surely helps is he wakes up to one of the finest views in the country, reports Cornwall Live .He has lived in a lay-by at Pendennis Point in Falmouth for more than two years, and it’s the closest thing he has to a stable home.  The van has no insulation or heating and the winter months can take their toll, but for the self-employed removal man, his humble abode allows him to live the le he loves - one he refuses to give up. In recent times, the -year-old says there has been greater hostility towards him and others who choose a similar lestyle. He has spoken frankly to Cornwall Live in the hope that it will help people understand why he chooses his way of le, and is asking others to take the time to talk to people in his situation before making judgements and assumptions. Explaining how he ended up in the lay-by, David says: “It’s really therapeutic for me here.  “Ultimately before here I had to move around from place to place. When I came here I was really surprised to find there were no real restrictions. Nobody really asked you to move or anything like that. “I just stayed here more and more. Eventually time just went by and it became easy because all my work’s here. I’m based where I need to be – in and around Falmouth – and ultimately it’s the cheapest form of accommodation for me. “It’s so expensive in Falmouth to live. This is my only real alternative.” David grew up in care and was moved around to ious foster homes during his childhood.  He says the van offer him stability, while also providing the freedom he craves. For a living he does “van and man work”, which he says mostly involves moving students in and out of homes in Falmouth he couldn’t afford to live in. While his way of le is a choice, it was partly born out of necessity. He first moved into a van after his former landlord sold the house he was living in four years ago. Now, he says he would struggle to afford to rent anywhere in Falmouth. “I have weeks here where work just dies to nothing and it can turn into months, a couple of months, especially through winter time,” he says. “We’re just barely surviving.  “I have always loved the freedom of the van living in beautul places like this and not being locked away in properties all the time. “That’s the great thing about the van you have got the freedom wherever you go, your home’s with you all the time. He says people from all walks of le end up at the lay-by. “I tend to keep myself to myself but there is a nice community,” he adds. “I know one man who has lived in a van for  years. Some youngsters come down to try out the lestyle. “You see some people who have separated from their partners and are sleeping in their cars.    “It ies throughout the year. Some people are here in the summer and go abroad in the winter because it’s too cold.” David says in recent months boy racers have parked up in the lay-by in the early hours revving up their engines, keeping everyone awake. Dog faeces was once smeared on his vehicle and people hurling insults towards him and others at the lay-by has become a fairly regular occurrence. Most worryingly for him, a single yellow line was recently painted along the side of the lay-by by the council. David now fears that further efforts will be made to force him, and others, out. Despite his struggles, he says he will not give in.  “Over time it’s been a long battle in the van between the good times and the bad times and the dark times through winter and the struggles, dealing with people and feeling like you’re there for people to kick,” he says. “Other people are forced into the situation and other people are just in this situation just trying to survive and get on with le. “It would be nicepeople saw people dferently and were willing to talk to people and ask what the situation was with people rather than just assume. “I don’t think we are doing anything wrong by the way we choose to live. “Everybody is entitled to live how they choose as long as they are not hurting anybody or causing damage to the environment or whatever it might be.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle harry share new","story":"NewsMeghan Markle and Prince Harry share new picture of Princess CharlotteThe couple shared the adorable picture of the four-year-old sitting beside Meghan on their Sussex Royal InstagramShareCommentsByRachel Endley :,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsThe adorable four-year-old is pictured in a never-seen-before picture from Harry and Meghans wedding \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghan Markle and Prince Harry have shared a new picture of Princess Charlotte as part of a series of behind the scenes snaps celebrating their first wedding anniversary.

The -year-old chose to run the Cardf Half Marathon on October  to raise money for Parkinsonaposs UK following her fatheraposs diagnosis with the debilitating illness. But at the  kilometre mark, Sarah-Jayne came to a halt, telling her husband and running buddy Steven that she was experiencing shooting pains up her leg. She was taken to the medical tent, where they advised the mum of two that she had pulled her hamstring.    Her family, concerned by the pain she was in, took to her to AE at the Royal Glamorgan hospital that afternoon where they gave the same diagnosis, advising her to ice her leg and to take paracetamol for the pain.Her husband and running partner, Steven, told Wales Online that it took hours to be seen by a consultant.We eventually got seen by somebody in AE, he said. Based on what they had seen, even though she couldnapost weight bare, they said they suspected a hamstring tear of some sort and gave the same advice with paracetamol and to put some ice on it. The following day the pain hadn’t alleviated and Sarah was complaining one leg was colder than the other, the affected leg. He said that the family took Sarah-Jayne back to hospital the next day after the pain failed to subside. ...We went to the Royal Glam and after several hours eventually got seen by a consultant. They didnapost feel any other investigation was needed, he said She even struggled to use crutches the pain was that much. She was literally on her hands and knees to shuffle herself up the stairs. She just acted on the advice the hospital gave her. You just assume this is what happens but after three four days the pain wasn’t getting better. From there Sarah-Jayne and her family were told to wait until an appointment that had been booked with a soft tissue specialist the following Friday after the race. At the appointment, despite the swelling, her family claim Sarah-Jayne was given stronger painkillers and told no immediate action was needed that day. But on Tuesday, October  her mother and father found themselves with no choice but to take their daughter back to the hospital for a fourth time as the pain intensied - where it was found she had fractured the bottom of her femur.  Steven said: Sarah was down her mum and dad’s and it got to the point where she literally couldn’t get out her chair she was in so much agony. They took her to AE and after a few hours then, having seen her leg which was twice the size, they then decided to x-ray and it was then they found the fracture. On October  they did a small operation to straighten out her leg as much as possible and booked her for the operation on the Friday afternoon. For Sarah-Jayneaposs family, the hours that surround her last day are understandably dficult to comprehend.On the afternoon after the procedure to correct her leg, they were called into the Royal Glamorgan hospital and told the active, healthy mother had suffered from a cardiac arrest during the operation, and that  resuscitation  had been unsuccessful.Steven said: They were going to put a nail in her leg so my understanding was that it was only a straightforward procedure that would only taken between an hour, and hour and a half. She was the only one going into theatre that afternoon so I went there about pm. Time does tick on but you think perhaps they are busy or perhaps they didn’t start straight away. It was after pm [when] they suddenly came in and sat down with me and said problems had arisen and that she had gone into cardiac arrest. Things went downhill from there. They tried as best they could to resuscitate her back. The family arrived and we were there and that was that. It was dficult because no sooner had it happened, you’re seeing it there in front of your eyes, then ,  minutes after you have to come home and tell your children mummy is not going to be back. But her family have a long journey for answers ahead, after facing delays to a final inquest date caused, in part, by a series of missed deadlines for the health board to submit relevant statement.    Speaking in a pre-inquest review held on Friday, coroner Graeme Hughes criticised the delays as unacceptable. Addressing NHS Wales legal representative Gavin Knox, he said: This is a family who have gone through a traumatic and unexpected death of a mother, a we, a sister, among others. It is not acceptable that matters relating to this in question have been exacerbated by signicant procedural delays. Not only does that accentuate the grief that the family have, and understandably so, which is the most important consequence of the delay, but as far as the administration of justice is concerned, it means...I have to stop what I am doing and put aside other matters that may be urgent as well. For Sarah-Jayneaposs family, it means they will have to wait nearly a year before they can begin their own grieving process. Steven said: The hardest part overall we are nearly waiting a whole year and until we get that verdict that’s when we as a family can’t start grieving it. We are just in a daze, trying to deal with it one day at a time. According to Sarah-Jayneaposs sister, the wort part has been what she describes as a lack of empathy for the family. Sally said: It’s that total lack of empathy and understanding for what the family is going through, and that’s what is hard to understand. [Sarah-Jayneaposs death] is constantly being brought up for us. It wouldn’t matterit was happy memories but it’s those memories we are constantly have to face week after week.

Margi Garner, , slammed on brakes while driving after she noticed a shadowy image on the road. She was persuaded by her optician to see an eye specialist, but multiple appointments failed to provide an explanation for her deteriorating vision. The gran of six, from Liverpool, says she made a deal with her doctor to go for an MRI as one last-ditch attempt at solving her vision problems. She now claims that agreement has saved her le. On Valentineaposs Day , Margi found herself opposite a nurse who delivered the devastating news that she had a large brain tumour, known as a meningioma, which had been pressing on her optic nerve. The mum-of-two and loving nan told the Liverpool Echo that it all began after what she thought was a near-miss car crash with a pedestrian.It all started when I saw a shadow on the road that I thought was a pedestrian and slammed on my brakes, but it was the branch of a tree. I went the opticians and he did an eye test on me and gave me ocal glasses. I thought aposwhateverapos, you know youaposre getting old. But then I could only see the outline of things, I could not see what they were. I thought you canapost go on like this. After ing to the opticians she was referred to St Paulaposs Eye Unit at the Royal Liverpool Hospital, where she reluctantly agreed to the MRI. She said: They told me I could have had the tumour for years, it was the size of an orange... When the surgeon met me she said aposhow youaposre still alive I will never know. After the diagnosis she was referred to specialist neurological hospital The Walton Centre, in Aintree, for surgery.  Surgeons were unable to cut out the entire tumour as it was too close to a major blood vessel, but Margi appeared on the mend until a follow up appointment in  revealed the remaining cancer had begun to grow again. Rather than attempt further surgery, Margi opted for six weeks of daily radiotherapy sessions, which shrunk the tumour and saved Margiaposs le. But as she recuperated, Margi realised something had changed. Partly inspired by The Walton Centre specialist nurse Emma Wilby, who was there for Margi following her surgery, she said: I remember waking up and thinking ‘I really need someone to talk to about what I’ve just been throughapos. I honestly don’t know how I’d have got through it without her. I was sat at home and I decided I donapost want to be stuck in here, Iaposm wasting my le away le is for living. This has completely changed my view on le. Margi, who worked with her husband Merv Garner at the family business, Mervaposs Key Cutting and Shoe Repair, decided to call The Walton Centre back and offer her services as a volunteer helping patients. She said: I just love helping people, itaposs a lovely feeling getting to talk to people and we have a good laugh. I remember one lady who was there with her son and daughter. She was just crying her eyes out, so I made her a cup of tea and asked her what was going on. She said aposwhoaposs going to look after my kids, Iaposm not going to survive thisapos. I just took her hand and said aposyou areapos. She said aposhow do you know apos, and I said aposbecause I have been through the same thingapos. Soon we were laughing our heads off. Margi has also raised funds for charities helping people diagnosed with a brain tumour and in January this year asked for donations to The Brain Tumour Charity instead of birthday gts.  Sarah Lindsell, chief executive of The Brain Tumour Charity, said: “Being diagnosed with a brain tumour is very frightening. It leaves people feeling isolated, anxious and uncertain about what the future holds. “We’re immensely grateful to Margi for sharing her story to show others that they’re not alone, and for everything she does at the Walton Centre to help patients at such a dficult time in their lives.” "},{"url":null,"title":"nail biting footage shows family","story":"NewsNail-biting footage shows family teeter along ft-high Giddy Edge footpathWith just a few sections of old metal handrail to hold onto this stairway to heaven overlooks the town of Matlock BathShareCommentsByStephen White:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video giddy-edge-britains-scariest-public-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailItaposs called Giddy Edge...and not without good reason.

In one photo, grinning Louis, who celebrated his first birthday in April, toddles along with a branch in his hand as dad Prince William smiles and keeps a close watch over him. In the background, George - dressed in a short-sleeve top and blue shorts - shows off his adventurous side as he climbs a rock waterfall next to mum Kate, who is balanced on a large rock at her woodland wilderness garden.  The royal youngsters put the rope swing to the test, with Charlotte giving it a whirl and William, , balancing Louis on top of the ball. Charlotte, dressed in a floral frock, holds on tight with her bare feet covered in soil as Princess Dianaaposs favourite flower - blue forget-me-nots - are seen peaking from the nearby foliage. Another image shows the Duchess of Cambridge, who took a hands-on approach to designing the garden, with her left arm around a standing Louis - wearing shorts and a cardigan.  He looks fascinated as he holds a stone with Kate kneeling at his side as they explore the RHS Back to Nature Garden at the Cha Flower Show on Sunday afternoon ahead of its public unveiling. Last week, Kate, , hinted that Louis was walking, saying at a special exhibition in Bletchley Park that he was keeping them on their toes. William and his two oldest children climbed into the tree house, while the duke also enjoyed a go on the swing. The new photos, taken by Matt Porteous, were released by Kensington Palace as the Duchess promotes her garden which was inspired by her childhood and is aimed at encouraging children to play outdoors to benefit their mental health and development.  The royal children spent almost an hour playing with their parents, as shown in six candid images taken by Mr Porteous, who was commissioned to shoot Louis’ christening, George’s third and fth birthdays, and the familyaposs Christmas card last year. George, Charlotte and Louis have helped their mum to collect moss, leaves and twigs to decorate the garden, which uses hazel sticks gathered by the family to make its den. The space features a high- tree house atop a chestnut trunk clad in stag horn oak, hazel and larch cladding that draws inspiration from a bird or animal nest.  The tree house weighs nine tonnes and was brought to London from Bristol, accompanied by a police escort. A swing seat, which Kate, Charlotte and Louis were photographed having a go on, hangs below the tree house. The garden also has a waterfall, rustic den and a campfire as well as tree stumps, stepping stones and a hollow log for children to play on. Interaction with the natural environment will be encouraged through the gardenaposs multi-sensory green and blue plant scheme.  Kate remembered the late Diana, Princess of Wales by including forget-me-nots, her favourite flowers. Among the blooms and foliage are blue periwinkle flowers, geraniums, astrantias, wild strawberry plants, ferns and rhubarb. Trees planted in the garden include a weeping beech tree, which is an ideal base for building a den under branches. Decking in the garden was created using reclaimed timber from Southend Pier.  Kate wanted it to be a woodland setting for families and communities to come together and connect with nature. The plot was also inspired by the Japanese outdoor activity of forest bathing, in which people take a slow stroll through woodland and aposbatheapos in its peace. It is understood Kate, who wore a colourful patterned dress and wedges for the outing, wanted to show her children the finished project on Sunday, so they could see what she has been spending time working on. Kate designed the woodland setting along with award-winning landscape architects Andrée Davies and Adam White of Davies White Landscape Architects.  The Duchess told Monty Don in an interview for the BBC: “I really feel that nature and being interactive outdoors has huge benefits on our physical and mental wellbeing, particularly for young children. I really hope that this woodland that we have created really inspires families, kids and communities to get outside, enjoy nature and the outdoors, and spend quality time together.” The conversation will air on Monday at .pm on BBC One. Kate has previously said she has fond memories of being outdoors as a child and is passing that passion on to her children.  Kate is a strong advocate for the benefits the outdoors has on physical and mental health, and the positive impact that nature and the environment can have on childhood development in particular. The duchess has been at the site almost every day in the five days leading up to the opening of the event and has been closely involved in the project from the very beginning. The duchess even made a few trips to the suppliers, Ms Davies and Mr White said. Askedthere was input from Kateaposs three children, Ms Davies said: We all brought our ideas to the table and shared them.  Mr White said of Kate: From the brief to the concept design to the sketches and model making, all the way through, to suppliers, nurseries, and all the materials in there, sheaposs been involved. Ms Davies added: Weaposve been out with her visiting places, to get ideas, weaposve been to some of the suppliers together. She said Kate joined them on a visit to a tree nursery to select the trees. Moving on to when they began building the creation on site, Mr White said: When the build starts on site, some of the designers donapost come down that often, some of them are quite sporadic.  And when the duchess joined us, and it all started to come together, itaposs quite addictive, itaposs a bit of a bug, and you canapost keep away because weaposve worked so hard and put so much energy, the three of us. He added that while some of Kateaposs visits were organised, she also phoned them and told them she was coming back again, saying: Iaposll be down lateritaposs OK. The adorable family photos were revealed a day after Kate gave a sneak peek of her Back to Nature Garden and was pictured playfully posing on the rope swing. The  Cha Flower Show, held at Royal Hospital Cha in west London, opens to the public on Tuesday.  Kateaposs involvement with the  RHS garden at the Cha Flower Show was first revealed earlier in the year.Earlier Sunday, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry marked their first wedding anniversary with a photo montage on Instagram.

Lois Herbertaposs dream th birthday trip came to a miserable end when she arrived at Denver Airport with her husband, three kids and parents only to be told something was wrong with their booking. Not only had half the party been bumped down to normal economy despite the family having paid for an upgrade, they were given seats scattered across the plane. When the airline refused to move the kids next to their parents a huge argument erupted in the airport departure lounge.  After three days of staying in a nearby hotel and countless failed attempts to get booked onto a flight next to each other, the Herbert family finally made it back home. The whole experience was a total shambles, mum-of-three Lois told . Lie after lie. My main concern was my children, which they didnapost care for or the safety of passangers. I have never been spoken to how the staff spoke to us in my entire le, especially in front of my children. Having travelled to the USA  times before, self-confessed Americanophile Lois was overjoyed to take Amelia, , Tilly, , and Daxton, , on a  day holiday stateside. As well as taking in Yellow Stone National Park and tourist attractions in Colorado, the family visited the Salt Lake City based headquarters of their Mormon religion. Loisapos mum Helen King, , spared no expense on the £, trip, even upgrading the seven plane tickets home from Economy to Economy Plus months before they were due to fly.    At the same time the business owner printed out confirmation of their seat numbers which show the seven of them were grouped together. The family were therefore shocked when they arrived at Denver Airport on Friday only to be told the seat reservations had been changed. We had paid for upgrades so we could all sit together but some of us were sat in normal economy, said Lois, who works in social media and marketing. There was no way our kids were going to be say away from us. I said aposI donapost care where you sit us but you have to sit us togetherapos. The manager just didnapost care. She said it didnapost work like that. She said there were no rules about minors having to sit with their parents. As the plane departure time got closer and the United Airlines staff failed to sort out the issue, Lois became more and more worried.    The kids wouldnapost have coped by themselves, she said. If I put them down next to a stranger there would have been a melt down when we walked away. I didnapost know who would be sat next to them. Had they all been vetted  I told the manager that there could have been a paedophile sat next to my two-year-old for all we knew. She said aposthat hardly ever happens hereapos. Concerned her children would be terried sitting by themselves and fearful she wouldnapost be on hand to stop them screaming or choking, Lois and her husband Lewis, , refused to get on the plane. Despite numerous attempts to have their booking changed to flights over the next two days, United were unable to get the family seats next to each other. Although the House of Representatives passed the Families Flying Together Act in  requiring airlines to seat parents and their children together, the Federal Airline Authority is yet to put that legislation into action.    After three long days stuck in the hotel airport they were finally able to make the long trip home back to Henfield in Sussex. A spokeswoman for United said the family were given Economy Plus tickets as a complimentary gesture and that adjustments were made to their reservations - including a name change - which impacted seat assigment. She said: Due to a lack of seven available seats together on the flight from Denver to London, our customer service agents offered alternative flight arrangements. We re-booked these customers on the first available flight that offered seats together and provided hotel and meal vouchers. We continue to remain in contact with our customers to resolve this issue. Lois said they were not given a complimentary upgrade and that the family has proof of paying for the upgrade. The reservations changes happened at Heathrow on the outbound flight due to an administrative error by airport staff there, she claimed. She also said the airline had not been in contact.

Qatar, which wants the world to visit and marvel, enjoying the beautul game in , must fulfil its responsibilities to guest workers – and that means boosting safety and offering a decent day’s pay for a decent day’s work.  Poverty cannot be pleaded by the state, so paying migrant workers such a pittance is simply unacceptable. Tories’ shame The Tories should hang their heads in shame after a respected international group condemned welfare cuts that mean children are going hungry. Criticism by Human Rights Watch can’t be easily dismissed by Conservative MPs when its denunciations of abuses in other nations, from Russia to North Korea, are endorsed by the same Tories. Food, heating, clothing, education, health and a home are as fundamental as free speech and protection from arbitrary arrest.Censure from a body usually found champ­ioning oppressed people in dictatorshipsand war zones is the ultimate condemnation of Conservatives.Defying terror The determination of Lisa Roussos – the seriously injured mother of the Manchester bombing’s youngest victim – is truly inspiring. Lisa’s charity walk to help survivors of terrorism demonstrates the unbeatable, defiant, wonderful spirit of people, a city and the country. It shows we will never be beaten by hate-filled, violent extremists.

Her downstairs neighbouraposs flat also shakes every time she washes her clothes, she told Chronicle Live during a reporteraposs visit to her home. Rachel, , bought her home in Gateshead, in Tyne and Wear, two years ago, and claims an inspection found that the wrong materials had been used on the floor.    She said she has been in a wrangle with developer Miller Homes. Rachel said: Every time the washing machine is on the floor vibrates. They kept saying it was the wrong machine but three washing machines later and it was doing it. It vibrates so badly the tiles have started to crack, dishes fall off the draining board, and I canapost use my washing machine when the lady is downstairs because it shakes her house. It is absolutely disgusting that I have been left to live like this.  They put anti-vibration pads down, but they must think Iaposm a woman living on my on my own and stupid. She contacted the National House-Building Councilwhich regulates building work.  An inspection on the property found problems with the floor, windows and outside cladding, she claims. Rachel said: They found that the wrong materials had been used on the floor. My flat is an extension onto the side of the building and they found the wrong joists had been used. There were also problems with the windows, which have been condemned, she said. They are splitting and water comes through, she said. They donapost shut properly. Rachel said she canapost move until the problems are fixed. She said: Iaposm stuck because I canapost even sell it. No one will be able to get a mortgage on it because there wonapost be any reports. It is so stressful. I canapost do anything with my home. The tiles have been up for the last  months in my kitchen. She added: The floor will have to come up, so I will have to move out of my house for six weeks and stay in a hotel. A spokesperson for Miller Homes said: “We are aware of some issues with Ms Cleaver’s property and in order to help resolve these have involved the NHBC.  We understand a schedule has been put in place to fix the flooring while discussions are currently ongoing regarding the windows.  We wish to reassure Ms Cleaver we are committed to resolving the issues as soon as possible.” "},{"url":null,"title":"instagram vs reality exposes what","story":"NewsInstagram vs reality exposes what influencers flawless photos should really look likeMake-up, clever angles, filters, good lighting and even a cheeky bit of photoshop are all keyShareCommentsByZahra MulroySocial Audience Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY News \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt shouldnapost need spelling out, but here we go - sometimes social media isnapost % representative of the truth.A scroll through Facebook or Instagram may throw up countless polished and envy-inducing images, but these donapost always tell the full story.Your favourite influencers could be some of the worst culprits when it comes to this smoke and mirrors approach, which probably doesnapost shock you.

The -year-old, who moved to Ireland from his native Turkey  months ago to study English and work, has decided to move out.He told Dublin Live: “I knew I was going to have to live with  other people in this house but the house was newly done up and it was a lot better than the three other places I was in so I took it.Dublin is just so bad, people don’t know how bad, it’s a horrible place for rental, I had no choice. Mr Furkan said he sleeps on the top bunk in a room he shares with three other people.      There are two bunk beds in each room of the -bedroom home. He said: “In Turkey I was starting out as a filmmaker, but I couldn’t get any work like that here and wanted to improve my English. It was a nightmare to start out, I couldn’t find work and I couldn’t find a decent place to live. I ended up working in restaurants which is fine but not my career. Now I sleep in the top bunk bed of a room with three other people also. There are two bunk beds in each room and there are  rooms.  He added: That’s  other people and me making it . There is a small shower toilet in each room so I share that with three people.  “The whole system in Dublin is a total joke. I have had enough and I am going home. In Istanbul, I was able to rent a whole apartment for around  or  euros.” He moved into the home in East Wall, in Dublin’s north inner city, after failing to find good accommodation” in Dublin.      He said the house was in much better condition than his previous rentals. It was once derelict for some time until it was sold and converted into a student type rental unit. Mr Furkan said: “At first you know, the house was better than the three others, but it’s just a joke now I can’t stick it any more.” As he gave a reporter a tour of the property, he pointed to two large communal areas which are packed in the winter months when everyone stays inside to cook. He said: “It’s ok in the summer you can go out there into the space at the side of the house where the bikes are and sit in the sun but in the winter you have to share and it is crowed, there is no space. “There are four bunk beds in each room, there is one room with two bunk beds. “We have a washing machine, five ovens, and it is better. But there are a lot of issues, it is not like a hostel. People living here - some of them are here maybe two years. A hostel is like one week and they go. We are not all students either.  “We live like a family.  But we have had a lot of problems because obviously some people think dferently. There is a lot of people to respect and there were clashes. “There was no bad incidents though, we always try to keep it all calm. The girls and the boys are separated. He added: “Almost all of us are students but some work too. Ireland is a good country and people are nice but Dublin is no good. I found it all too tough. “This house is too packed, for me,I compare it to Turkey and how I live here and there. In each room because of Dublin and the prices there should be a maximum of two per room. “You can’t find anything decent. If you get a single room in Dublin it is  euros or even , euros. “If you put students and squeeze them into one room, it’s all about money I feel squashed in a room.” Another tenant, who did not want to be named, said: “I am a student. I am here since last year. This place is very good compared to the other houses. I was in another house and the rooms were even smaller and the smell was so bad. There is no bad smell here. This is not a bad house but the housing problem in Dublin is terrible. We are squashed here. There are two common rooms for  people and everyone will be here in the evening. We can’t really cook together, we split the times, summer time people normally eat outside.  “Before here I had to go out to the launderette to wash my clothes and in a house the landlady charged me  euros to wash my clothes when the price is meant to be included. “I never had this problem in my le, I have not been in a situation like this. It is terrible in Dublin.” Mr Furkan said: “If this happened in Turkey people would go crazy, even the hospital care and rent over there is so much better and cheaper.” Another tenant said: “This house was designed as a money-making house. Where I come from in Europe, you would get a whole house for  euros, this house is too much but I am not complaining too much because this house is better than previous places I had. “I have seen houses where there are four people in one room and the room is smaller than here. I should be paying  euros for my bed or  euros maximum. “Everybody likes this location - Lidl, Aldi, Starbucks, McDonaldaposs, it is all here. East Wall is a great location it is a very nice area but it is bad to live like this.” Housing campaigner Fr Peter McVerry said: “In the present climate the owners of properties have all the power and the tenants have none. The alternative to living in what is unsatisfactory and even appalling accommodation is being homeless, all the power is on the side of the owners, they can charge what they like. They can even ignore the regulations, it will only come to lightsomeone complains, but no one will complain because they don’t want to be thrown out. I get lots of incidents like this one, overcrowding is a huge problem. In one case I heard of someone who was renting a bed for  hours a day, someone who was working during the day was sharing with someone who was working at night. They split the  hours. At least half a million people are living in distress, people living in good quality accommodation are paying most of their salary on accommodation.” In a statement, Torrelles Tradings company Ltd, the owners of the property, said: “We provide a very good accommodation service to all our students which is in high demand and at a fair price. We deal with all regulatory bodies as required in full. We have no further comment to make publicly at this time.” "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/05/2.42988786-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/05/2.42988786-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/05/2.42988786-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/05/2.42988786-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"blind dundee man left housebound after road diversion increases number of speeding cars","story":"A blind man said he has been left housebound after a road ersion increased the number of cars “speeding” past his Hilltown home.Donald Garland, of Harcourt Street, said he has been pleading with Dundee City Council to introduce temporary traffic calming measures which he says would help his and other residents’ safety.The -year-old – who was registered blind in  – claims he has been “trapped” in his house due to the speed of vehicles using his street as a shortcut.Donald, who was an electrician to trade before being diagnosed with Leber hereditary optic neuropath , said his usually quiet street has become to dangerous for him to stay on.LHON is a condition which mainly affects central vision, needed for detailed tasks.Examples include everyday tasks such as reading, driving, and recognising faces.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"one way to keep tarbert flowing","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTarbert is about to get a new, improved sewer serving the village.Roads, however, will have to be dug up to replace existing underground pipes.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

One of the many fun attractions, our popular ‘scarecrow’ knitter, came about by accident after an old rusty garden chair was donated then renovated with the aid of brightly-coloured spray paint, after which it was simply crying out for a body to sit on it.#Plans are already afoot for next year’s event – surely a must following such a success.Another one of the organisers, Val Whale, added: #We’re holding a post-mortem with the craft group members this week to discuss what worked, what didn’t work, and what we can do better next year.#Many from the community have already pledged their support, showing how crafting is so much more than just a hobby and can help forge friendships as well as passing on what can become a lelong skill.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

reassess the regionrsquos CCTV networks, following news it is being allowed to fall into disrepair.Recently, council officers reported that the CCTV network is ldquono longer fit for purpose.And it was revealed that neither the local authority nor the police can afford to install and maintain the security systems.Currently,  of the councilrsquos  CCTV cameras dont work, and that number is likely to increase in the coming months and years.Now, Tweeddale East councillor, Stuart Bell, has put forward a motion for the local authorityrsquos next meeting, asking officers to produce a list of options for revitalising the failing CCTV network.He said: ldquoEffective public CCTV can make a positive contribution to community safety which is primarily the responsibility of the police but one in which the council has an obvious part to play.ldquoHowever, the capability of the system now operating in Border towns has deteriorated.ldquoWhilst there are limited budgeted council funds to invest in the current CCTV system, and whilst there will be advantages in opening up opportunities for communities to participate in the definition of what is needed, any decisions need to be based on a quantied assessment of costs.ldquoI ask officers to prepare a report showing the costs and options for renewing or replacing existing public CCTV for each community with a CCTV system to make that information part of a consultation with area partnerships, community planning partners and the police, fire and rescue, and safer communities board, before bringing forward a final report for consideration by this council.ldquoFurther to this that officers bring a report to the next Council meeting with a consultation plan, including whether outside resources will need to be brought in, the cost of consultation and a timescale for that consultation and final report to be brought to council.There are eight systems, all of which are operated by Police Scotland, in Duns, Eyemouth, Galashiels, Hawick, Kelso, Melrose, Peebles and Selkirk.Scottish Borders Council is currently spending pound, a year repairing the systems, and officers have advised councillors that this will continue until the CCTV cameras are ldquobeyond economic repair.Police Scotland have also confirmed that although they view the CCTV systems as a valuable resource, they will not be providing funding for their maintenance.Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer has thrown his weight behind the motion.He said: ldquoCCTV plays a vital role is helping prevent and solve crime and I find it completely incomprehensible that decisions that impact the safety, health and well-being of our communities can be taken without a full and complete assessment of the consequences.ldquoOnly this week we have learned how CCTV has helped detected a serious crime in one Borders town.ldquoThis motion follows a refusal of the councilrsquos chief executive to allow the original report to be procedurally

cyclists.Several Borders bobbies have saddled up as part of the nationwide campaign.Operation Close Pass was launched after research found many drivers are unaware that by passing to close to a cyclist, they can gain up to three points on their licence.Police will ditch the unorm and don bike-mounted cameras in attempt to catch drivers who get too close for comfort over the coming weeks.They will radio aheada driver passes too close and offenders will be pulled over for a warning.Inspector Richard Latto of the Lothians and Scottish Borders Road Policing Unit said: ldquoThe safety of all road users, especially those in the vulnerable category, remains a priority for Police Scotland and Operation Close Pass is one way we can educate and inform road users of the necessary passing space for cyclists.ldquoRural roads can present additional challenges, such as changing road conditions, dferences in speed limits, narrower roadways and changes in weather conditions.ldquoWersquod encourage all road users to share the road space responsibly whilst adhering to appropriate speeds within the limits.With  official bicycle routes in  locations, it is clear to see why cyclists love the Scottish Borders.However, they cannot always hear traffic behind them due to rushing wind and accidents can easily occurmotorists donrsquot respect the highway code.Gary Robson, owner of Bspoke cycles in Peebles, told us that close passing is a frequent hazard for cyclists.He said: ldquoImagine that the bike you are about to pass is a mother with a pram or a horse and rider.ldquoYoursquore going to slow down and show respect by passing at a safe enough distance.ldquoWhen drivers start to think of bike riders as sons, daughters, parents, grandparents and not just as bikes then we will all be able to share the road safely.Police Scotlandrsquos recent survey found  percent of people asked were not aware that close passing was a practice resulting in three penalty points.Consisting of over  Scottish men and women the poll showed most were unaware of the consequences of failing to leave a carrsquos width of space when overtaking a cyclist.In the Scottish Borders cycling accidents occur fairly regularly on Borders roads - and there have been fatalities in the past decade.Cyclists in groups have taken to riding two a breast on the road in order to use up the same space as a vehicle forcing the motorists to slow down and wait until it is safe to overtake.This method has not been free of criticism however as motorists often find it dficult to overtake two cyclists safely rather than give one bike more room.A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: ldquoThe Scottish Borders welcomes tens of thousands of cyclists every year who are here to enjoy some of the best on and off-road cycling that Scotland has to offer.ldquoAs well as local cyclists and cycling groups, we fully support Cycling Scotland and Police Scotland in raising awareness of the risks to riders and the penalties for drivers who overtake too closely.\"Belles on Bikes is a Scottish initiative set up for women to cycle together socially.They have  independent groups across Scotland run by volunteers who are passionate about helping women enjoy cycling and feel safe.One member of the Scottish Borders branch is Brenda Mitchell, a senior partner at Cycle Law Scotland, which is based in Peebles.Brenda told us: ldquoClose passing is incredibly dangerous and there is a huge need for the campaign in every region of Scotland.ldquoOne incident springs to mind involving an elderly male who was overtaken by an HGV far too closely catching the cyclist with the backdraft resulting in him crashing and injuring his clavicle.ldquoWith those incidents you have to remember the highway code as a motorist must give as much room to a cyclist as they would a car.ldquoIt is a super initiative as it focusses on educating drivers as cycling in the Borders has become such a popular activity.ldquoHowever, I find the drivers in the Borders more courteous on average, as most leave the acceptable distance when overtaking.ldquoAs cycling is so big in the Borders, many drivers know how it feels to be on both sides of the wheel and take the necessary steps to make cyclists feel safe.ldquoRespecting one another when sharing road space is key as cyclists also have a duty to be courteous towards drivers.With the tenth year of the TweedLove Bike Festival next month, and Tour orsquo the Borders ing for a third year, cycling tourism in the Borders is continuing to grow.Thanks to Border Buses and the Borders Railway becoming accessible for bike users, people from all over Scotland can travel to the Borders for a dayrsquos cycling in a more energy efficient way.Brenda added: ldquoAs people are becoming more aware of global warming issues, they know it is a good idea to cycle shorter distances instead of driving.ldquoHowever, many people are put off getting on their bikes for fear of their safety.ldquoTherefore, I want to congratulate Police Scotland on raising awareness and educating drivers so that they are unlikely to

When she contacted the council to press for vegan meals they claimed it was not possible to provide vegan meals that complied with the nutritional guidelines for school meals.ldquoThat is quite clearly incorrect. The British Dietetic Association has long recognised that we can get all the nutrients we need on a fully plant-based diet, at every stage of le.ldquoIf Glasgow and East Renfrewshire councils can produce vegan menus that comply with guidelines, so too can Scottish Borders Council.ldquoAs a result of the councilrsquos refusal, the eldest child of the vegan parent had already missed out on free school meals in P-.ldquoI wrote to Scottish Borders Council challenging their refusal to provide vegan meals, pointing out their legal obligations under human rights and equality law.

It is not acceptable that vegan children are missing out on free school meals, or that they are excluded from eating in the school canteen with their friends.ldquoWe should be supporting children who have made a moral decision to avoid animal use and killing, recognising the impact their behaviour has on others. A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: ldquoOur schools are in a much better position to provide nutritionally balanced vegan meals than they were previously.ldquoFor example, we can now buy things like soya milk, hummus and vegan sausages, which werenrsquot available on our order list even a couple of years ago.ldquoAt no point did Scottish Borders Council say a vegan menu canrsquot offer vital nutrients.ldquoHowever, as we did not offer a specic vegan option, offering the child part of a mealwould not have been nutritionally balanced and would not meet her energy requirements."},{"url":null,"title":"jenna-named-beltane-queen-for-2019","story":"YOU donrsquot have to be born into Royalty to be a Queen, not in the Royal Burgh of Peebles anyway.For this town celebrates its own monarch family each year.And on Wednesday afternoon schoolgirl Jenna Jones was proclaimed  Queen of the Beltane Festival.The sun shone in a cloudless sky and townsfolk gathered outside Peebles Community Centre waiting to greet the new Queen and her Court.Cheering schoolchildren applauded as the names of the delighted pupils were announced within the hall, and when it came to the announcement of this yearrsquos Queen, a clearly shocked Jenna threw her hands to her mouth gasping in sheer surprise.The -year-old from Priorsford Primary School told the Peeblesshire News that she feels very grateful and lucky to be chosen.She added: ldquoIrsquom so excited to begin the role of Beltane Queen and all thatrsquos involved.Jennarsquos parents, Lisa and Mike were standing outside waiting to catch a glimpse of their daughter when she exited the community hall.

This was because I had never done it before. I canrsquot quite believe this myself that Irsquove left it to my late s to finally make the conquest.How many times I have said to myself, and my family, as we explored dferent parts of East Lothian, ldquowe must climb North Berwick Law someday as its distinctive shape loomed into view. Itrsquos a hill visible from so many places, just asking to be explored, but I always seemed to put it off. But finally I have done it.Itrsquos a huge pile of igneous rock, basically cooled and solidied lava, a remnant of ancient volcanic activity. Itrsquos a giant plug on a now-extinct volcanic vent. Folklore tradition has a very dferent origin for the hill, as I have already written about.When you stand at the base of the Law and peer up, you can see where the great glaciers of the Ice Age have scraped and polished the hillrsquos surface, making it quite rugged and craggy in places, and smoothed down in others. Itrsquos  feet high, not a mountain by any definition, yet still impressive. If it were in a hilly area we would notice the Law less, but it looms up from flatter landscape, right next to the sea, and so demands attention.No wonder it became a place of human settlement in the Iron Age period. How could you not use this hill as a location for a fort  Its steep, rocky braes are perfect for defence, itrsquos next to the sea with a ldquoview of the whole world, as my four-year-old put it ndash and was not entirely wrong!Cast your eye to the north and across the Firth was the land of the Picts. The open sea can be seen to the north east and almost the entire of East Lothian is laid out before you, to the Lammermuirs in the south and the Pentlands in the west.Here was the land of the Gododdin, the Celtic people who lived in our country when the Romans arrived, although they had a dferent name for them: the Votadini. They survived the Roman presence, perhaps entering into some alliance to preserve their tribe. The Romans were ruthless with those who did not co-operate and submit.But later, in the seventh century, long after the Romans had gone, the Angles arrived from the south. The Gododdin resisted the invasion. The great early poem Y Gododdin tells us of a great assemblage of warriors who feasted at Edinburgh before heading south to their deaths in battle.What wailing and sadness there must have been when the news of the loss of all those young, handpicked warriors arrived. The Goddodinsrsquo fate was soon sealed, the Angles took control of the land and the Lothians became part of the Northumbrian kingdom. The remnants of the disposed Gododdin migrated to Wales, it seems, taking with them their stories and legends of what became known as lsquothe old northrsquo.These were my thoughts as I found the remains on an old round house as we climbed to the summit of the Law. At first I wasnrsquot sure ndash it looked almost like a small standing stone circle ndash but on closer examination I realised the stones were the foundations of a Celtic round house. An archaeologist friend later confirmed this.There are at least  Iron Age round houses or similar structures so far discovered on the Law some are less obvious. Butyou carefully study the ground as you ascend, evidence of these ancient homes can be seen. There is also evidence of old walls or ramparts.So here a community of the Gododdin once lived. From their front doors they could see their sister forts of Dun Penderbut now named Traprain Law, and Din Eidyn, later to be called Edinburgh.So I entered the circle of stones as my kids played on a rock nearby. I was now in a space where once a family might have lived. It was not large, but then again, why would it be  It was a place to sleep and sit round the fire together. No need to make space for all the modern lsquonecessitiesrsquo of le. Their le would have been lived outdoors. But what stories were told in this intimate space, what lives were led, and when was the last night this was used as a home There is lots more to the history of North Berwick Law. The watch house from the Napoleonic period, the observation bunker from the Second World War and, of course, the whale bones, which are now made of fibreglass. All these connect to stories that make up the history of this fascinating wee hill.But for me on that day, it was the walk through prehistory, and the mysterious remains from an ancient Celtic people, that left my imagination tingling."},{"url":null,"title":"golfers-surprise-as-he-finds-guinea-pig-on-golf-course","story":"Engineer William Waddell, , was playing in the Lady Captainrsquos Day at the club in Prestonpans on April  when his friend hit a wayward ball on the ninth hole.Donna, Williamrsquos we, said: ldquoHe was looking for his friendrsquos ball when he saw something moving in the grass ndash he took a closer look and saw it was a guinea pig!ldquoHe picked it up and handed it in to the pro shop.The family put pictures of the furry find on Facebook and, in no time at all, a young girl came forward with her dad, another club member, to take care of it until the owner could be found.Donna added: ldquoThe dad happened to be an expert on guinea pigs, judging and showing them up and down the country, so they were the perfect people to take care of it really.ldquoWersquove all had loads of messages on social media from people offering to give it a home, so whatever happens, Irsquom sure itrsquoll be loved.William and Donna live in Duns with their two children Kiera, , and Jaydon, .Donna added: ldquoWersquore really keen to find out what will happen to the wee thing.

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship.

Thatrsquos why, when presented with the newspapers findings, local government body Cosla responded that councils ldquoadhere closely to national nutritional standards.In the coming weeks Scotlandrsquos schools will break for summer. When childrenin August nitrites should be disappearing off the school menus across the country.Herald on Sunday campaign: time to dump \"nitro\" meat from schools and hospitalsThis doesnrsquot require legislative change. Nicola Sturgeon and her Deputy John Swinney should get their skates on, adjust the national nutritional standards and ban cancer-linked chemicals from Scotlandrsquos school canteens. Should they do so they will have the full support of the Scottish Labour Party.CATCH UP: OUR CAMPAIGN ON NITRITESHowever, so far they have failed to show any leadership on the issue. In the absence of national action it will be down to inidual councils like the one I lead to make the right decision for our own school pupils.North Ayrshire Council already exceeds the Scottish Governmentrsquos nutritional standards. We have been reducing ham, bacon and cured meats in our school menus by introducing meat-free days. All our Primary Schools have \"Gold Food for Le\" accreditation. We are sourcing more organic produce and using more local suppliers. However, when The Herald on Sunday asked whether our menu was completely nitrite-free the councilrsquos answer was no.So over the summer our school menus will be reviewed with input from local pupils. Cured products will be off the menu, red processed meats will be reduced and we will be working to source nitrite-free products across the full menu.Guillaume Coudray: removing nitro-meat from schools and hospitals is \"urgent\"Thatrsquos a decision we will make of our own accord. It reflects our values as a council which has pioneered school holiday meal provision over many years and whose work around dignied access to food has resulted in pound, of funding being awarded in recent weeks to projects led by the North Ayrshire Foodbank and the Three Towns Growers allotment group.The reality, however, is that cash-strapped councils will be left to make their own decisions. The SNPrsquos failure to offer an alternative to Tory austerity and instead dump cuts on to local government means that councils, including SNP-led authorities, are struggling to maintain even basic services. When councils are fighting just to keep teachers in front of pupils is it any wonder that three-quarters are not exceeding national nutritional standards and banning nitrites from school menus This is a national public health issue. It requires national leadership and it needs a government that genuinely works in partnership with councils to make the best decisions for Scotlandrsquos young people, not one that starves councils of resources to a level where cancer-linked chemicals become an acceptable part of school meals.Councillor Joe Cullinane is the Labour leader of North Ayrshire Council"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-labours-top-candidate-corbyns-brexit-strategy-is-costing-us-votes","story":"David Martin said Corbyn, who is sceptical about a second Brexit referendum, is trying to ldquoride two horses at once and complained that his message ldquoisnrsquot cutting through.Askedhis UK leader would be an asset on the doorsteps, the party veteran replied: ldquoIt would be mixed, letrsquos be honest.The Herald on Sunday can also reveal that senior Scottish Labour figures have questioned their partyrsquos campaign strategy of attacking Brexit Party figurehead Nigel Farage.Labour and the Tories are expected to be routed at the European elections this week after MPs failed to come to a resolution on leaving the EU.Tory voters are angry that their party has failed to deliver Brexit, while pro-Remain Labour supporters are furious that Corbyn is not unequivocally backing a second referendum.Corbyn wants to secure a Brexit deal in line with Labour values, or secure a general election. If neither proposition materialises, Labour will back the ldquooption of a public vote.However, Corbynrsquos nuanced position is frustrating Scottish Labour activists, as over % of voters north of the border backed Remain in the EU referendum.Many activists want Scottish Labour to become a voice for staying in the EU and fear that the current position could result in their party losing one or both of their Brussels seats.Martin, who as an MEP since  is Scottish Labourrsquos longest-serving parliamentarian, is top of his partyrsquos list of candidates. He is also a staunch Remainer who believes there should be a confirmatory vote on any Brexit deal.Speaking to the Herald on Sunday, he said of his partyrsquos campaign: ldquoWe are realistic about our prospects. We are not in any way expecting to expand on the two seats we already have. Frankly, our objective is to hold the two seats wersquove got.He said of Labourrsquos layered position on Brexit: ldquoBluntly there is still a bit of confusion about where we stand.Asked whether he believed the message was clunky, he said: ldquoIt is. I wouldnrsquot pretend it is easy to get it across. Sometimes when you are campaigning, it is two minutes on the doorstep and you move on. On this issue, thatrsquos not possible so, bluntly, you do have to spend a bit of time explaining it to people. Itrsquos a complicated message.By contrast, he said the pro-Remain parties, such as the SNP, Lib Dems and Greens, have a ldquovery simple message:ldquoI think there is a need for clarity in our message. A more straightforward message would certainly get a better resonance on the doorstep.Asked whether a pro-Remain policy would be more likely to result in Scottish Labour holding its two seats, he said:ldquoI think it would be, far, far more likely. Our European message isnrsquot cutting through as well as wersquod like it to. So, yes,we had a clearer message we would get more votes.On Corbyn, Martin said there was a contrast ldquobetween the European candidates and the message that is still coming out of the Leaderrsquos office.He added that voters point out the contradiction between his pro-Remain view as a candidate and Corbynrsquos pro-Brexit stance:ldquoIn the context of the Brexit debate, he [Corbyn] does come up as lsquowell, you say that to me, but thatrsquos not what your leader is sayingrsquo. And you get another whole discussion about what the Leader is trying to say.Martin said Corbyn is popular with some younger voters, but warned: ldquoHe has come across as appearing to ride two horses at once.On whether the Brexit policy will cost Scottish Labour votes, he said: ldquoYes. My worry is we are going to underperform in relation to our national standing.However, he said that an intervention tomorrow by former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who backs a second referendum, will make a ldquobig dference.Asked what his message to Corbyn is, days before voters go to the polls, Martin said: ldquoBe clear that Labourrsquos wants a second referendum.This newspaper also understands that a stormy meeting of Labour MSPs last week led to fierce criticism of the partyrsquos strategy.MSPs are unhappy that Corbynrsquos face, not Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard, is on the partyrsquos election leaflet.

What it said was that around kg of COe was produced per kilogram of prawns. That figure was derived by factoring in the fact the aquaculture lagoons in which the prawns were being farmed were created by destroying the mangrove forest. These tropical forests in saltwater are considered a vital storage system of whatrsquos called ldquoblue carbon. Previously such farmed shrimp were found to result in lower greenhouse gas emissions than wild caught prawns ndash as North Atlantic prawn fishing involves extensive trips using up huge amounts of fuel.Joanna Blythman restaurant review: Ostara,  Coburg St, LeithSince then the Vietnamese government has said that they are working to improve the way the country farms prawns, and setting new targets for sustainability ndash though many still continue to farm intensively.For a lower carbon option, replace with Scottish rope-grown mussels with emissions of only g per kilogram.Red pepperg  g COeA  World Wildle Fund report listed that peppers grown in the UK produced around . kg CO emissions.

However labour conditions in the cashew industry are so bad they are sometimes called \"blood cashews\".Steak, Tatties and VegSirloin steakg   to  kg COeThe chief reason beef has its huge impact is that cows burp methane, a greenhouse gas  times as potent as carbon dioxide. As with most foods, the story around beef isnrsquot simple. One steakrsquos emissions arenrsquot the same as another ndash and the impact ies widely according to how the beef has been farmed, what the cattle are fed on, what breed they are, and whether they are reared on land cleared by deforestation. It has been calculated that beef raised on deforested land is responsible for  times more greenhouse gas emissions than cows on natural pastures. Since Scotland was deforested long ago, this isnrsquot a factor considered with Scottish beef.Herald on Sunday campaign: time to dump nitro meat from schools and hospitals#In Scotland we produce a lot of beef ndash more than we eat. Are the emissions from a nice grass-fed steak, farmed in Scotland, far better than the global average  Andso by how much  This is a debate that rages. One recent study found that grass-fed beef actually has a higher carbon, as well as land-use footprint. However, research from the Rowett Institute in Aberdeen has also found that a substance found in plants in bioerse pasture systems added into the diet of lambs reduced emissions of methane by %.The range among farms is huge. But whatever the iation, it remains that case that beef emits  times more GHG emissions per gram of edible protein than common plant proteins, such as beans.Meanwhile, there is still hope for steak lovers. The notion of breeding or bioengineering low emissions cattle has gained a lot of traction recently. Researchers in Scotland have shown that some cattle have a gut flora that produces less methane, and speculated on the possibility that cattle could now be bred for this. There have even been experiments in putting a small amount of seaweed into cows diet ndash which has resulted in decreased emissions from cow burps.Potatoesg  g of COTatties are low carbon footprint pleasures.

A dozen eggs produce around .kg of COe. However, again, numerous factors, around the style of farming, transporting and packaging impact on this. Mike Berners Lee observes that a study from Cranfield University suggests that, in terms of climate change, organic eggs are about  per cent worse than those from battery farms. He says, ldquoItrsquos worth remembering that climate change is not he only issue. If you care about animal welfare as well as climate change, buying fewer eggs but making them organic might be a sensible compromise.Breadg  COeUniversity of Manchester researchers looked at sliced loaves and found footprints ranging from  to g CO per loaf.

Factors included were the energy, water, fertiliser and pesticide required to grow them as well as the resources used for packing and the energy used in processing and transporting.Cherry tomatoesg   to g of COeOur beloved cherry tomatoes come with a sting. Those farmed in the UK are mostly grown in greenhouses heated by gas and oil. Overrall Spanish tomatoes rate better.

This included providing formal recognition of our islandsrsquo unique characteristics and challenges, and tailoring policy to support our islands effectively.ldquoNow we are asking islands residents, those who have an interest in islands, such as those who have been forced to move away from their island communities, and other stakeholders what their concerns are, and where we should be focussing resources in future to help our islands, and all who live on them, to flourish.ldquoThis is a great opportunity for us to develop a strategic direction for the Scottish Government and the wider public sector to optimise support to island communities, taking into account factors like ageing populations and out-migration, public service provision, bioersity and enhancing skillsets. Of course, itrsquos also about working closely with local authorities and partner agencies to find and build on the undoubted positives associated with island le. We also want to learn lessons from policy successes that have been achieved across island communities.ldquoI sincerely hope that this consultation helps to promote the voices of Scotlandrsquos islanders, to harness their talents and island resources, and provide the best future for these important communities that in so many ways constitute the best of Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-tory-mp-michael-gove-has-the-vision-and-ideas-to-be-leader","story":"Stephen Kerr said Gove, a Scot, had the ldquovision and ldquoideas to become the next Conservative leader, adding that a majority of his colleagues north of the border would feel a ldquonatural pull towards him.With the Tories expecting to be routed at this weekrsquos European election, May will come under pressure to set a timetable for her departure from Downing Street.She intends to bring back her draft Brexit withdrawal agreement to the House of Commons, but there is no sign it will be approved and Tory MPs want her to go quickly.In any ensuing contest, Conservative MPs will whittle down the candidates to a shortlist of two, after which the final decision will be made by party members.An opinion poll published yesterday showed that former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is the grassroots favourite, while fellow Brexiteer Gove was in third place.The duo worked closely together during the EU referendum campaign, but fell out spectacularly after David Cameron resigned. Gove initially backed Johnson to be leader in , but withdrew support and stood himself.Kerr, the MP for Stirling, told this newspaper: ldquoI believe Michael combines a lot of personal and leadership qualities with a lot of experience.ldquoIf you think about his track record in Government wherever he has gone, he has made something happen. Therersquos no question that when he moves into a Government department, there is an agenda that emerges and he manages to marshal the resources to deliver those policies. Thatrsquos not true of all Ministers.He said Gove, who was born in Edinburgh and brought up in Aberdeen, also cared passionately about Scotlandrsquos place in the UK.ldquoIntuitively, because he is a Scot, he understands the issues surrounding the Union. He also recognises the fact that being a Unionist is not a passive description, it has to be about making the Union work. He gets that.ldquoItrsquos not just a case of upholding the Union, or preserving the Union, he would be about strengthening the Union.He said of his Scottish colleagues: ldquoI do think the majority of my colleagues will feel a natural pull to support Michael, not just because he is a Scot, but because he understands the Union.Kerr said that Gove ldquoupset the hard Brexiteers by not resigning in protest over Mayrsquos deal, but claimed he has broad appeal across the party: ldquoHe can bridge the breadth of the church. He can appeal to people in all parts, apart from those with intractable positions.The MP conceded that the previous clash with Johnson would ldquoundoubtedly be an issue for some Conservatives, but he said:ldquoHe is a unier. He is articulate. He has vision and ideas. He is able to translate those ideas into actual policies.

Homes began to suffer from lack of investment and the model village became outdated, tired and in need of care.Residents drted away, and by  the historic mill and its associated buildings could easily have vanished had it not been for a committed group of people who understood its unique value and set about saving it from crumbling.ldquoThere was a time when the future of the village was really uncertain, said Ms Martin.ldquoThe mill closed in  mainly because it wasnrsquot financially viable.

The epic series comes to an end on Monday amid a welter of hysteria as viewers finally learn whorsquoll emerge victorious after eight bloodstained seasons telling the story of the battle for the Iron Throne of Westeros.With a global audience of one billion, itrsquos easy to dismiss GoT as simply highly polished massndashmarket TV. But that would seriously underestimate what George RR Martin ndash who wrote the books which inspired the show and and helped create the series ndash has to say about le in the st century.Part of the secret of the showrsquos success is that it taps directly into very modern concerns. A scene might take place in a brothel or involve a sword fight on a lonely road, but more often than not it will be making comment on issues like childrenrsquos rights, infertility, or alcoholism. Itrsquos not a show afraid to take on the big questions facing humanity today.Susan Swarbrick: Why naming children after TV characters is a perilous ideaImmigrationOne of the biggest storylines in GoT sees the leaders of Westeros ndash the fantasy setting for the show ndash trying to keep Wildlings from their land. Wildlings, a sort of mashndashup of Picts and Vikings, live north of Westeros ndash a medieval kingdom like th century England ndash and are kept out by a giant man-made wall. ImagineTrump built Hadrianrsquos Wall.The Wildlings are culturally very dferent to the people of Westeros and so are feared and hated. However, with their land facing destruction, they want to get south and over the wall to safety. They are refugees fleeing war.Unsurprisingly, Lena Headey, who plays evil queen Cersei Maisie Williams, who plays heroine Arya Stark and Liam Cunningham, who plays fan favourite Ser Davos Seaworth, have all spoken out on the need to help Syrian families escaping violence.Mental healthPost-traumatic stress disorder looms large in GoT. This isnrsquot the kind of show where survivorsfrom battle without mental scars. Many characters are profoundly damaged ndash none more so than Arya Stark. The show centres around the enmity between the Starks, and their rivals the Lannisters.Aryarsquos father Ned Stark is executed in front of her when she is just a child. Forced to run for her le, Arya tramps the land in disguise, facing rape and murder at every turn. She channels her fear and anger into revenge becoming a highly accomplished killer by the time she reaches adulthood.But Arya is a psychological wreck. She obsesses on violence, can carry out acts of brutality without batting an eye, and has all but expunged empathy from her emotional palette. She displays all the symptoms of PTSD, including hyper-vigilance and a fragmented sense of identity ndash at one point she even gives up her own name.As Shahida Arabi, the author of books such as The Smart Girls Guide to Self-Care, says: \"Arya endures what is known as complex trauma throughout the show ... drastically shaping her personality and worldview.\"DisabilityItrsquos rare to watch a show with so many disabled characters ndash even rarer to find the characters portrayed in a positive and honest fashion, including the figure many see as the star of the show, Tyrion Lannister played by Peter Dinklage. As Tyrion says, he has been on trial his entire le for being a dwarf. Yet he remains a man of intelligence, charisma and passion.Other characters are paralysed, another has lost a hand, one has a profound learning disability, and another has a facial disfigurement. The show rarely,ever, tips over into sentimentality or paints disabled people as whiter than white ndash theyrsquove flaws, theyrsquore real, and theyrsquore never allowed to forget their disability, and are often cruelly humiliated for it.Disabled activist Rebecca Cokley says until GoT shersquod \"never seen my own experience in le reflected so accurately, so vividly, so viscerally\".: Game Of Thrones fans hoping for answers as series endsMeTooLe is dreadful for women in Westeros. Women are told when to marry and who to marry women and girls are raped in war women are sold into sexual slavery women are abused within marriage. Yet, as GoT nears its conclusion, itrsquos the women who have emerged as the strongest, most intelligent characters ndash though often driven by all-consuming desire for vengeance after the treatment theyrsquove endured.In a show renowned for killing its stars, the number of men who were front and centre when the show started has been severely reduced in size. Most are dead or no longer in charge. In this final series, women command.Sansa Stark, played by Sophie Turner, has gone from the most victimised character to something akin to Boudica. \"Itrsquos funny the way [my storyline] is kind of mirroring whatrsquos happening in real le,\" says Turner. \"How all these women who were subjected to a lot of horror and oppression are taking a stand.\"The very modern phenomena of public shaming and \"slutndashshaming\" were also incorporated into GoT ndash most infamously when Queen Cersei was paraded naked through the streets by a mob. Jon Ronson, writer of So Yoursquove Been Publicly Shamed, said the scene was basically Twitter brought to le.Climate\"Winter is coming\" ndash the three most repeated words in the series. From the opening scenes, viewers have been aware that something is very strange about the seasons in Westeros ndash summers last for years, and when winter finally comes itrsquos a mini Ice Age.The changing climate doesnrsquot just bring disruption and suffering ndash it brings death. As winter comes, so do the White Walkers ndash an army of the undead, risen from the snow, out to destroy humanity.The leaders of Westeros, however, are too busy fighting among themselves to pay attention to the coming winter. The parallels with climate change are one of the few hidden messages which Martin will admit to, saying: \"The people in Westeros are fighting their inidual battles over power and status and wealth. And those are so distracting them that theyrsquore ignoring the threat of lsquowinter is comingrsquo, which has the potential to destroy all of them.\"ReligionReligion is hated in Game of Thrones. Not by the characters ndash most of them are in thrall to one church or another ndash but by the creators. Whenever religion rears its head, misery follows in quick succession.Therersquos a multiplicity of faiths in GoT and all are flawed. Torture, persecution and murder are carried out in the name of religion. Fathers burn their own daughters at the stake. Religious fanatics assault and tyrannise ordinary people. One of the most evil characters in GoT is the priestess Melisandre, the \"Red Woman\" and follower of the \"one true god, the Lord of Light\". Her religion is one that favours fire and blood rather than forgiveness and peace.Gods throughout the book are mostly useless ndash they donrsquot grant prayers, their prophecies donrsquot come true. Religious leaders are either lecherous hypocrites or stone-cold fanatics.The swipes at religion have clearly stung. One religious writer, Jana Riess, said: \"Martinrsquos commentary on the ineptitude and corruption of a state religion is frankly a bit predictable as a cultural product ... Nothing new to see there.\":Game Of Thrones star Sophie Turner says husband Joe Jonas saved her leRace and homophobiaRace is a slippery thing in GoT. On the surface there appears to be little racism. No racial epithets are thrown around, and therersquos no white supremacist ideology on display. But people of colour are mostly at the bottom of the pile.Slavery is endemic across one half of the world, and while most slaves are black, it doesnrsquot appear asrace was the reason for their enslavement. Rather the strong enslave the weak.The only time homophobia rears its head is for political reasons. No-one really cares muchsomeone is gay ndash unless, of course, their sexuality can be used to hurt them. One of the most charismatic characters in the series is the bisexual Oberyn Martell, who lives le by his own rules ndash however, he does have the luxury of being a prince.Diversity in casting has been an issue though. Star Wars actor John Boyega said: \"There are no black people on Game of Thrones.\" Thatrsquos not quite true, but certainly black actors are less prominent than white actors.The character of Daenerys Targaryen ndash one of the main contenders for the Iron Throne, due to the fact that she owns dragons ndash also has been criticised for slipping into White Saviour mode. She does a lot of freeing of black slaves and then being showered with love and awe.\"The beautul part about the show is that it is reflective of the real world,\" says Michael Harriot, a GoT fan and writer for the online magazine Roots. \"Daenerys is basically the embodiment of white privilege. She is inches away from becoming the most powerful woman in the world simply because someone gave her some dragons at birth.\"Wealth and inequalityIn Westeros, money is the root of all evil. In war, the Iron Bank of Braavos lends funds to whoever financiers think will win no matter their morality or crimes. Wealth is power and power is wealth. If you can buy your way out of prison, yoursquoll live, andyou canrsquot yoursquoll lose your head.The rich are exploitative, decadent, amoral. Petyr Baelish is perhaps the best example in the show of the hedge fund mind at work. One line sums up his attitude to the world: \"Brothels make a much better investment than ships, Irsquove found. Whores rarely sink.\" Donrsquot come to GoT looking for political correctness, incidentally.Meanwhile, the poor live and die in squalor, in places like \"Flea Bottom\", surviving on a \"bowl of brown\". The people are there to exploit, intimidate and terrorise ndash and the rich hold scented hankies under the noses when they have to walk among them.Politics\"When you play the game of thrones, you live or die. There is no middle ground.\" So runs the famous quote which gives the show its title.Like today, compromise in politics is dead in GoT. Politics is not about the greater good, itrsquos about iniduals scrabbling for power over the backs of everyone . Itrsquos a self-serving system, and one which only worsens the lives of the \"small folk\".Only the elite can play the game ndash and the % have to live with the consequences of decisions taken by morally questionable, rich and stupid leaders. Political paralysis is the order of the day ndash with no ruler equipped to understand the complexities of leadership. Everything is broken in Westeros ndash therersquos not enough money, guards canrsquot police the city, news is faked, therersquos no social mobility, the lives of the poor mean nothing. CNNrsquos John Blake says the show offers \"eerie political parallels\" to the world we inhabit today.WarFor a series that drips blood, therersquos no more pacist show than GoT. Martin has said that \"true horrors derive not from orcs and dark lords but from ourselves\".War achieves nothing in GoT. The series opens after the assassination of a Mad King, and looks very possibly asit might end with the enthronement of a Mad Queen ndash Daenerys. Throughout the show, Daenerys has moved from put-upon na to full-blown tyrant. In the last episode, she carried out an act of mass murder so appalling that many fans were outraged that their heroine had turned into the ultimate villain. Thatrsquos kind of the point of GoT ndash everyone is morally grey and war reveals that.The Red Cross even studied the behaviour of key characters and labelled them all war criminals, including Daenerys who has crucied people, burned victims alive, and carried out reprisals on civilians.Military violence in the show often seems inspired by the worst atrocities of the last  years. Cities are burned, child soldiers forced into service, prisoners are mutilated, raped and murdered.

All men must die.The history which inspired Game of ThronesTHE TV series may speak to modern times, but it draws heavily on the past. The greatest influence is the War of the Roses ndash two rich households locked in a death embrace over who will rule a kingdom.The Dothraki ndash a horde of nomadic horsemen ndash are taken straight from the history of Genghis Khan. Daenerys Targaryen is an updated Cleopatra. Brienne of Tarth is a lt from Joan of Arc.The infamous Red Wedding scene ndash in which one rival family slaughters another over dinner ndash was inspired by two Scottish atrocities: the Massacre of Glencoe and the Black Dinner of  when the teenage Earl of Douglas and his little brother were murdered after supper with the young James II at Edinburgh Castle.The Lannister family have more than a touch of imperial Rome about them ndash from poisoning rivals, to killing their father and sleeping with their siblings, the wealthiest family in Westeros cares only about itself and its desires.In case youve missed itGAME of Thrones ends tomorrow, soyou want to know whatrsquos been happening over the last eight years, herersquos a quick catchndashup.The story begins after the assassination of the Mad King ndash Aerys Targaryen, who butchered and tyrannised his people. The realm has been reunited under the usurper Robert Baratheon ndash backed by his old friend Lord Eddard Stark, and married to Cersei, the eldest daughter of the Lannister clan.Cersei kills King Robert and puts their son, the Caligula-esque Joffrey, on the throne. However, Edd Stark discovers that Joffrey is the product of incest between Cersei and her brother Jaime. For his troubles, Stark gets beheaded ndash and so war beings, with rivals lining up to take the Iron Throne.Meanwhile to the north, the Nightrsquos Watch ndash a rag-tag group of soldiers meant to guard the Wall ndash learn that the Wildlings are coming, intent on entering Westeros to gain safety from an army of the undead pursuing them.Across the narrow sea, the surviving daughter of the Mad King, Daenerys, rises from an exiled \"beggar princess\" sold into marriage to a Queen with three dragons at her back, ready to take back her kingdom with \"fire and blood\".Mondayrsquos episode will finally reveal who will sit upon the Iron Throne.

Wersquore talking about a crisis.The campaign is to urge every MSP in the summer recess to engage with at least one aspect of visual art ndash a gallery, a show, an artist in their constituency, an education project, a painting, sculpture, or other work of art ndash and share their experience on social media.Its aims are to \"sharpen minds\", and to emphasise the important work artists do outside galleries, shows, and festivals.SCAN, in the campaign, is highlighting through a series of case-studies, how art goes beyond the gallery, the white space or the artistrsquos studio, and benefits whole communities.The campaign, however, comes against a background of rising pressures on the visual arts world, and artists.The current winner of that high-profile prize, Charlotte Prodger, a Glasgow-based artist, last week unveiled her new work at the Scotland+Venice show, an initiative which has been staging an independent show at the Venice Biennale since . In Venice, the main UK Pavilion show is by Cathy Wilkes, another lauded artist based in Glasgow.Artists such as Douglas Gordon, Karla Black, Nathan Coley, Martin Boyce, Martin Creed, Christine Borland, Jacqueline Donachie, Richard Wright, Susan Philipsz, and Duncan Campbell, among many others - often, but not always, connected to Glasgow School of Art - have been part of the generation of artists who have made Scotland, and Glasgow, a key site for the creation of cutting-edge art.However, evidence shows that the working le of many,not most, artists is low paid and precarious: many have to work other jobs to make ends meet ndash meanwhile, publicly-funded galleries that show and support their work are caught in the public sector squeeze on funding, support, and city rent rises.The campaign comes before the anticipated publication of the long-awaited National Cultural Strategy of the Scottish Government, which SCAN, a membership body of  members led by director Clare Harris, hopes can include some real financial muscle as well as warm words about the importance of culture to Scotland.She said: ldquoWe think that actions speak louder than words.ldquoFor the sector to move forward in confidence and enthusiasm, then support, investment and funding must be increased. We feel that itrsquos not about simply giving us money to carry on doing what were doing, but also recognising the massive value and impact that visual arts has in the community. We are a vital ingredient in how people in our cities and the country live: visual art is part and parcel of the Scottish identity, it is part and parcel of well-being and we feel that while the visual arts scene is widely celebrated, we would like to see more concrete funding and investment to give it the support that it needs.She said that the new campaign, which she hopes will result in every MSP noting their encounter with art on social media with a #ArtInAction hashtag, will ldquochallenge decision makers to think dferently about art ndash and to recognise its potential by investing in it.In its new submission to the Culture Committee, SCAN paints a stark and potentially picture of the financial pressures on artists, galleries and organisations.Standstill funding of visual arts bodies, such as galleries, by Creative Scotland, which is operating under its own financial pressures, means that by  there will be a ldquoreal term drop in funding of around %.The paper says: ldquoIf this trend continues with the next round of RFOfunding, there is real concern among our members that they will reach breaking point. Standstill will become collapse.SCAN say diminishing levels of investment and funding at both local and national level have left the arts infrastructure ldquoin a fragile state with artistsrsquo livelihoods precarious.\"Creative Scotland itself is well aware of the limits of its funds, which come in a grant from the Government and through the unpredictable coffers of the National Lottery.Its acting chief executive, Iain Munro, recently told MSPs of the Culture Committee that its direct funding package of pound million ndash around .% of the Governmentrsquos overall budget ndash is ldquonot in tune with the actual potential here in terms of the creative industries being a growth sector for Scotland.The SCAN paper also says that local authorities have to implement some ldquolong term and strategic thinking, noting recent controversial decisions such as proposed cuts of the funding of Peacock Visual Arts in Aberdeen, and the proposed signicant rent rise for Stills photographic gallery in Edinburgh.Most notably the paper calls for ways to be found to create conditions for fairer income for artists: the average working le for an artist is not attending international shows and festivals, but struggling to find time to create work, and finding spaces to create that work, in between other jobs such as teaching.A survey by SCAN two years ago, for Creative Scotlands Visual Arts Review, found that the average total income of respondents was pound,. This dropped to just under pound, for those who were self-employed, who were mainly artists. South of the border, a recent report by the Arts Council of England found that two thirds of artists earned less than pound in the previous year from their art: only % earned more than pound,.It was notable then when Ms Prodger won the pound, Turner Prize in December, she ruefully noted what she might do with the prize money.She said: ldquoIrsquoll live on it. Irsquoll pay my rent and my studio rent and some bills.\"The SCAN submission points to other countries efforts to make le easier for artists: in Canada there are a number of tax deductions for self-employed artistsand in Belgium a ldquosmall fees scheme ensures small payments are tax exempt.ldquoEssentially the sector is extremely well-qualied, extremely dedicated, low paid and precariously employed.ldquoThere are a lot of people on short term contracts. The very nature of arts funding is short term ndash you have just got the funding for one round and then you have to start thinking about the next application ndash basic stuff like that.ldquoIt is quite striking: the pressure that everyone is under, from inidual artists to directors of arts organisations, to show impact, to show outcomes, to fill in forms and tick boxes, whilst producing the great work that they do.Ms Harris said many MSPs may be surprised by what they encounter this summer.She said: ldquoI think they will see a stream of work and maybe some people that they didnrsquot really know existed. I think they will have some myths busted.These are things like: we are not a lsquodrain on societyrsquo. We are not rich, we are not lsquotortured artists working away in garretsrsquo.ldquoBut we are sole traders, we are small businesses, we are collegiate, we work together, we are hard-working and provocative, all these things ndash and perhaps some people just donrsquot know this.ldquoI hope it concentrates some minds, and raises awareness of why the cultural strategy is important.\"Nuno Sacramento, the director of Peacock Visual Arts in Aberdeen, backed the campaign and added: \"Its really important that politicians and policymakers from all backgrounds have a better knowledge of how valuable a contribution visual art makes to our communities.\"Through art, a creative, free and safe space can be opened up for people of all ages, abilities and backgrounds to explore new ideas and ways of communicating. It doesnt sit within one box marked culture, but impacts on our lives in many dferent ways, and plays a positive role in our physical and mental wellbeing.\"She said: \"One question for policy makers is this - what do we value  If we value creativity then that needs to reflected in public policy.\"Artists work really bloody hard and you need to have an energy, perseverance and total unflinching commitment to what you do. But the truth is that its extremely dficult, at times impossible, to earn a sustainable living from your work. I know many really talented people who struggle and sometimes give up. Its a leaking pipe.ldquoIts one of the most precarious careers I know.\" Often artists are not acknowledged as workers at all but there is some great work being done in the sector in Scotland to challenge this, from the Scottish Artists Union and organisations such as SCAN.There are still misconceptions about how artists work and live, she said.Ms Ewan added: ldquoWhat we need to do is increase awareness outside the sector here in Scotland of what artists actually do, how they actual work with organisations and communities \"I think many people are perplexed by this question, perhaps the old fashioned idea of the artist as a singular solitary genius still pervades public and political consciousness, so connecting artists and organisations to policy makers is the next positive step.\"Scotlands culture secretary, Fiona Hyslop, is not unaware of the work of artists outside the arts world: this week, in fact, she visited the Delta Studios in Larbert, Falkirk: as well as running classes for adults and children, they take social work referrals, offering a creative outlet to people with physical and mental disabilities.The final publication date for her governments National Cultural Strategy, which has already been the subject of public and arts consultations, is still unknown.It is likely to be seen later this year, but it is unclear whether it will come with its own raft of funding packages or policy changes - what is known is that all wings of the Government, not just the cultural policy areas led by Fiona Hyslop, are involved in its progress.A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: \"The Scottish Government is making good progress on the National Culture Strategy.\"With so much rich and ied feedback from our consultation, we are working carefully to shape the content, with the aim of publishing later this year.\"Ms Harris said she wants more than just enthusiasm expressed in the Strategy, which was published in draft form last year.She said: ldquoThe Culture Strategy [draft] had a lot of great things in it, but we felt that it didnrsquot really commit to saying lsquowe will put the funding in, it is about celebrating the great impact of culture, and it is about celebrating isnt culture brilliant, but it doesnrsquot say we will do this, we will invest in this.She added: \"SCANs position is that we need to look more widely and more strategically about how arts are funded, at the national and the local level.\"We have an amazing scene. But I think people feel that is not backed up by support coming from those that have the power, and thats government and those that make the budgets and create the budgets.\"THE ARTS IN SOCIETY: CASE STUDIESThe SCAN campaign wants politicians to take note of cultural projects that have impacts outside the arts world.* The Travelling Gallery was founded in , and has since then brought art and artists to schools and communities in inner cities, suburbs, towns, villages and remote rural areas.Many of these communities are identied with the highest deprivation in the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation. Between  and  it attracted , visitors, averaged  venues a tour, and provided more than  artist-led learning events.Gordon Douglas added: ldquoBy even slightly rearranging reality for people you allow them to have more understanding of how they can change things. I think the arts have the ability to hold up a mirror to people and allow them to see these things.*At the Cherry Road Centre in Bonnyrigg, Midlothian, artists from Artlink Edinburghrsquos Ideas Team  Sensory Workshops provide weekly sensory workshops for people with profound and multiple learning disabilities.Liz Davidson, the manager of the centre, said: \"Itrsquos an exploration of human relationships built upon mutual trust and equality. All parties involved are learning and exploring their environment and sensory world, listening and observing together.\"Artlink has worked for the last  years, within the care system, with artists working in collaboration with people with cognitive disabilities and mental ill health.A report on the project by Dr Susan Levy and Dr Hanna Young of the University of Dundee found that: \"The work of Artlink and Cherry Road recognises that meaningful experiences are achieved through slowly building authentic and genuine connections. Working with the artist inspires creative thinking which motivates to create a lsquosafersquo space where all can work together equitably, learning from each other opening themselves, and those they work with, up to new experiences and perspectives.\""},{"url":null,"title":"the-joanna-cherry-imbroglio-and-how-we-got-to-here","story":"The SNP has long maintained an impressive outward solidarity but this tremor, the shting of the partyrsquos internal tectonic plates, has badly shaken it.

A former election agent has also quit the party over what he claims are personal dferences with the Edinburgh South MP.Kevin McKenna: Dysal SNP Westminster group threatens push for independenceThe abuse Cherry faced came when, at an evidence session of the Commons Joint Committee on Human Rights, she questioned representatives of Twitter and Facebook about the online abuse of female MPs. Following that she was deluged with offensive tweets and threats, one message included a cartoon with a gun with the words ldquoDo it.There was also a message which confirmed Cherryrsquos whereabouts at a specic time and placewhich prompted a police escort.Cherry also made a barely-veiled attack on Sturgeonrsquos leadership, saying, ldquoThe problem we have is that from the moment the first parliamentarian complained against was hung out to dry [a reference to colleague Michelle Thomson ] a signal was given to those with petty motivations thatyou seek to smear an SNP parliamentarian the party wonrsquot get behind them, eventhey are exonerated.She also claimed to be surprised ldquowhen no one from the leadership contacted me to inquire after my wellbeing.There is a simmering row, too, within the SNP over transgender rights. Sturgeon is one of those who believe people should be able to self-declare their sexuality. However Cherry, as part of a -strong group, signed a letter urging the Government not to rush into ldquochanging the definition of male and female.

I could swear those village urchins in Listerrsquos native Halax were wearing Dolce and Gabbana.Last Tango in Halax to One thing we did not find out last night, the first of eight episodes, was how Lister came by the name in the title. For now, she is the stuff of local legend, an ldquoentertaining sort usually to be found travelling the world having adventures. Now she is reluctantly ing home, and all the county is a flutter.ldquoShersquos coming back because something went wrong, harrumphs her father . True enough, as we see in flashback and learn from the journal she writes using secret code, Listerrsquos heart has been bruised again.An old flame advises her to enter into a marriage of convenience with someone, anyone, so she has the cover of respectability, but Anne is having none of it. Possessed of many rooms of her own, she wants a we of her own.ldquoThe reality is that will never happen, says her lover. Yet the idea is calmly presented as what it is, an entirely reasonable proposition. Listerrsquos sexuality is dealt with in the same no fuss way. Lister may be hundreds of years ahead of her time but she sees that as societyrsquos problem, not something she should apologise for.While Lister looks around for ways to fund her next escape from Halax she learns that Ann Walkeris still living nearby. She met Miss Walker and her sister years ago, just after their parents died. ldquoNo oil painting, she snfs.  But wait. With the sister married and gone to Scotland, Ann has inherited the family fortune. She has also matured into a beautul young woman. Suddenly she has the potential to be the apple of Listerrsquos eye. ldquoWhat she lacks in rank she certainly makes up for in fortune, Lister confides to the viewers in voiceover. At other times, she will look straight to camera, Fleabag-style, to tell us what she really thinks.Fleabag ends on a highAs with Phoebe Waller-Bridgesrsquo character, to whom Lister will inevitably be compared , it is hard to know yetwe entirely like Gentleman Jack.

Wersquore not. Wersquore defining people as hopefully supporters of us but also people that have common problems, however they voted.Labour sources insisted Mr Corbyn was not expressing a change in policy.But Nicola Sturgeon attacked what she regarded as Labourrsquos equivocal position, saying the Opposition had ldquotried to pretend that theyrsquore both in favour of Remain and in favour of Leave and they end up fooling nobody and haemorrhaging support and respect as a result.Meanwhile, Rory Stewart, the International Development Secretary, insisted Conservatives and Labour were only ldquohalf an inch apart on Brexit, despite the cross-party talks collapsing last week amid recrimination.He said: ldquoWe do in many ways agree none of us wants to remain in the EU, none of us wants a no-deal Brexit, which means logically there has to be a deal. If there is to be a deal, the Labour and Conservative positions are about half an inch apart.Mr Stewart explained the Prime Ministerrsquos new offer of an ldquoimproved package of measures would cover three elements: strengthening workersrsquo rights, environmental protection and trade with Europe. It is also believed to include the use of technology to avoid the need for border controls between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.When it was pointed out Mr Corbyn had said this was not enough, the former Black Watch officer replied: ldquoAt no stage has Jeremy Corbynhellipsaid there is anything  that he wants other than he sometimes suggests he wants a second referendum to be able to remain in the EUhellipldquoWithin the terms of a Brexit deal, I donrsquot believe there is anything that Jeremy Corbyn or we want that is that far apart.Mrs May is expected to give a keynote speech in the coming days setting out details of her new offer to be included in the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which will be debated and voted on by MPs in the first week in June.On Tuesday, the UK Cabinet will discuss the \"definitive votes\" process, whereby MPs would vote on ious Brexit options, but Mr Corbyn expressed coolness towards the proposal, saying: ldquoItrsquos unlikely it would take us any further forward.In other developments:*Change UK has called for revocation of Brexit ldquoin the national interestthe alternative presented by the Government is a no-deal Brexit*Trade Secretary Liam Fox will argue in a speech on Monday that the UK will be more open to the world post-Brexit and the City of London will \"emerge fitter, stronger and more dynamic than ever*Mr Stewart and his Remain Cabinet colleague Amber Rudd will this week launch a One Nation caucus of  Tory MPs, urging their party to reject the \"comfort blanket of populism\" and promote candidates who oppose a no-deal Brexit and the Brexiteer ERG faction*Simon Coveney, the deputy Irish premier, made clear the EU would not renegotiate the Brexit withdrawal deal regardless of who the UKs next PM was as the bookies made Boris Johnson the clear favourite to succeed Mrs May*Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, turned the airwaves blue after repeating his partyrsquos \"B*****ks to Brexit\" European elections slogan and*Labour veteran Dame Margaret Hodge has been called on by Sue Hayman, the Shadow Environment Secretary, to \"consider her position\" in the party after supposedly urging Labour supporters to vote tactically for pro-EU candidates in Thursdayrsquos Euro-poll"},{"url":null,"title":"was-europe-unfair-on-uk-in-eurovision","story":"The  edition of Eurovision became an all too familiar story, meaning ithas still been more than  years since the UK won in  with Love Shine a Light by Katrina and the Waves.It prompted continuing criticism on social media overbias and unfair bloc voting.Michael Rice, , only managed to rack up  points in the competition for his performance of song Bigger Than Us ndash putting him in last place.Meanwhile, the Netherlands Duncan Laurence was crowned the winner, with  points.Mr Norton, who hosted the BBCs coverage offered his condolences to Michael as the result was announced, admitting that he was worried the hopeful would be left \"upset\".Speaking as the result was announced, the Irish presentersaid: \"I hope hes not upset because he did all he could tonight, he really did.\"Our hearts go out to Michael and the whole team who worked so, so hard on the competition this year. You cant fault his performance tonight.\"He added: \"He absolutely did not deserve that result.\"It was really unfair, and I hope hes OK... Hes got his mum and his Nan here, and we will all go and give him a hug later on.\"The singer himself hasnow thanked fans for their support, insisting he and his team still \"smashed it\".He wrote on his Twitter page:\"Just want to say thank you for all the amazing messages of support! Me and my team have smashed this whole entire journey and Im just so proud!!Late tweet as fell asleep yesterday but UK coming last, very unfair this year no  Normally I think itrsquos deserved as makes no effort but this year decent.

Just saying.. #Eurovision #GBRI thought the whole point of having the juries was to avoid geographical political bias!  @Eurovision #EurovisionSongContestWhat I love most about Eurovision is the obvious political bias in the countriesrsquo voting. Like Cyprus giving Greece  points just like every single year. #Eurovision is so politically bias. I donrsquot watch it because I donrsquot like singing contests but also because they donrsquot care about performance, its usually rigged.The UK wonrsquot get many votes for example, because we want to leave the EU. The UK wonrsquot vote for Ireland  vise versa.Review Grand Final Results #Eurovision #DareToDream# ## Worthy winner.# ## The True winner.# ## Third. Again. Overrated. Dreadful song.

Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"“But we know the impact it has on children meeting the veterans who make Scotland’s five million poppies every year and listening to their stories, as well as getting the chance to make their own poppy.“We wanted to take that experience on the road to school children and people across Scotland and so the idea for Bud was born.”Funding largely came from two sources – £, from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and £, from LIBOR funds. Bud was also supported by the Celtic FC Foundation, Edinburgh Trust No Account, First Bus, Gordon Fraser Charitable Trust, Neat Vehicles, PF Charitable Trust, The Basil Death Trust, The Murdoch Forrest Charitable Trust and the Welsh Family Trust.Then came a decision on which vehicle to use.Gordon said: “Our initial idea was a bus but we later decided a truck would be more accessible and flexible.“We spoke to Brakes, which delivers school meals – Bud is the same model as one of its  tonne trucks.“The contract then went out to tender and we teamed up with Neat Vehicles.“Their creative team turned Bud from a drawing into reality.

Louise Mackie, headteacher of St Denis’s Primary School, believes it will be a big hit.She said: “Being the first school to visit was a real honour and I’m sure thousands of other students and members of the public will find their Bud experience as moving and thought-provoking as we did.”Bookings will operate on a rolling three-month calendar with the charity aiming to book visits in neighbouring areas. Gordon explained: “If we’re going up to Aberdeenshire, we won’t be able to visit Peebles the following day. “Ideally we’d like to spend several days in the north-east, before then travelling down to the Borders or central belt. “Logistically, that will make it a lot easier for us but we’ll see how it works in practice!”To book Bud or access the supporting learning resources for teachers, visit the website poppybud.org.uk."},{"url":null,"title":"charity team come together for meeting","story":"Over  people from across Aberdeenshire joined together for a charity gathering recently.Members of staff, board members and volunteers met at CLAN House, CLAN’s head office in Aberdeen, for its bi-annual meeting and for a day of learning and friendship.Staff members and volunteers travelled from Shetland, Orkney, Elgin, Banchory, Ballater, Moray, Inverurie, Turrf and Crimond to hear the charity’s latest news and learn about new initiatives.At the event, CLAN CEO Dr Colette Backwell shared the latest CLAN achievements, identying that the charity supported , people in , almost half of which were new clients, including  new clients who were supported by the children and families’ team.Staff members also shared the latest news from the charity’s centres across the north-east, enabling the whole team to learn from each other.Anne Marie Robson a support volunteer for CLAN commented: “The gathering is a great opportunity to get to know everybody and to understand the overall picture.“It’s nice to feel involved – it makes you feel even more passionate about what CLAN does.”CLAN CEO Dr Colette Backwell said: “It is important that the CLAN team gathers together when we can, not just to hear the latest news but also to share good practice and learn from successful initiatives happening in our shops and centres.“CLAN supports , people every year, and each client has dferent requirements, so it is vital that our team works together to identy the best type of support.“CLAN’s services in the community, at our centres and outreach facilities, are vital as people undergoing cancer treatment may not be able to travel far, so we work hard to reach as many areas as we can, bringing professional, caring support to those who need it most.”The CLAN gathering takes place twice a year enabling those working in outlying areas to meet with their team members and gain a greater understanding of the achievements of CLAN as a whole.CLAN supports those who have a cancer diagnosis across the north east, Moray, Orkney and Shetland, as well as their friends and family members.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..!

It is an information gathering and assessment exercise which helps stakeholders, the public and the planning authority understand the potential environmental impacts of major development proposals.The Orkney Community Wind Farm Project could generate signicant income and community benefit for Orkney, say the council.Plans for a development of up to around MW in Hoy were announced to the local community last year — with sites for a development of up to MW on the island of Faray and up to MW on shoreside farmland at Quanterness outside Kirkwall now also being investigated.The scoping report for Faray is available at here. The scoping report for Quanterness is available at here.Councillor James Stockan is leader of Orkney Islands Council. He said: “We are keen to keep the public informed on this project as it develops. Our well-attended consultation events were very useful, and allowed a range of views and opinions to be expressed and we’re looking forward to carrying out a further event in Westray in June.#Once all the information events are complete, we’ll be looking to provide more online information on the project and in the meantime I’d encourage folk to take a look at the scoping reports for detailed information.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On the screen behind her was a photograph of tourists in the Colosseum. In her younger days, she used to eavesdrop on teachers showing school groups round the Roman ruin. Whatever their nationality, she said, the conversations would follow the same pattern. The teachers would start by asking their pupils: “What used to happen here ”One child would stick their hand up and answer: “This is where the Romans killed people for entertainment and threw them to the wild animals.” The teacher would ask: “Would we do that nowadays ”The class would chorus: “No, Miss.” “And then,” Beard continued, “you would watch this horrible self-satisfied glow of confidence in human progress, a sanctimonious fog of self-righteousness, descend on the whole group.”The point of Beard’s Gford Lecture – and I’m paraphrasing– was that we still get a kick out of watching violence. However morally superior we feel as a society, there is always an audience for footage of beheadings or spree shootings. Now, just two weeks after her talk, The Jeremy Kyle Show – once branded a “form of human bear-baiting” – has been cancelled, not because someone at ITV had a belated moral epiphany, but because, after  years of prophetic warnings, a le has been lost.Steven Dymond killed himself after taking a lie detector on the show he had hoped to prove to his fiancée that he hadn’t cheated on her, but the opposite happened – he “failed” the detector and his fiancée left him.The programme has not been broadcast, so we don’t know the specics. But given the show’s format has been pretty much the same since its inception, we can use our imaginations. There would have been a good deal of provocation, finger-pointing and on-air humiliation.Sadly, Dymond’s belittling didn’t end with his death since it was announced, he has been subjected to a public post-mortem. His character has been dissected on the front pages of tabloids, and the entrails of his le pulled out and examined for some indication that perhaps he deserved his fate. His ex-we has suggested he was a paedophile and domestic abuser. This may, of course, be true, but as he is dead, it’s unlikely we’ll ever know for sure. And in any case it misses the point. It doesn’t matterDymond was a good man or a bad man it doesn’t matterhe applied  timesorhe had to be dragged there by his hair: the programme had a duty of care towards him and yet it made a circus out of his troubles, as it has with so many other guests.Topics such as “I’m sleeping with my stepdaughter, but is her baby mine ” would challenge an experienced therapist never mind a lay-person . But there was no problem too complex no set-up too dysal for Kyle to ponticate on.The most unedying feature was the faux concern. The show was about “conflict resolution”, we were told, aspitting feuding family members against each other was going to bring anything but greater ision. Co-opting a pedestal, Kyle performed the role of moral arbiter, berating his guests for their poor le choices. But what kind of a le choice is making £m a year off the back of other people’s misery Then again, The Jeremy Kyle Show could not have had such longevity without its one-million-strong audience who – like their Roman forebears – were happy to clap and cheer the dog-fight.At her Gford lecture, Beard talked about the process of othering she suggested the Romans could countenance killing as entertainment, just as some of us can countenance watching a man gun down worshippers at a mosque, because of the distance created between “us” and “them”. There is a physical distance, of course, created by the element of theatre and, in modern times, by the fact we are viewing the abuse via a screen. But there is also an emotional distance. In Rome, the gladiators tended to be prisoners, and on The Jeremy Kyle Show the guests tended to be poor. In both cases, they were perceived as inferior. How did we get to a place where the unemployed and the struggling were seen as legitimate targets for our scorn  The answer is incrementally. For decades now, reality TV shows have been setting up those from our post-industrial towns as objects of ridicule. Since Matthew Parris made his documentary about living on benefits back in , there has been a succession of ill-conceived programmes, such as The Scheme, which take the most damaged, dysal iniduals and hold them up as typical.This dehumanisation process has been fed by government policy and government rhetoric by welfare reforms and Atos hearings and by the ision of ordinary people into the categories of “skivers” and “scroungers.” In that sense, The Jeremy Kyle Show was the perfect fit for the age. Like The Scheme, it only worked as a conceptit operated at the extremes. And over the years the programme makers had to up the ante to move on from straightforward infidelityto paternity tests, incest and foursomes.Some pointed out the guests were gagging for attention. That’s an easy criticism to make when you are lucky enough to have a voice and a . To whore yourself out to a show that has nothing but contempt for you takes a profound lack of self-esteem.ITV insists it took its responsibilities seriously: that guests were assessed by mental health experts. But some of those who took part were so obviously in need of support, it is dficult to believe the checks were anything other than cursory. Now the programme has been cancelled, and MPs have ordered a review of all reality TV shows, but why did it take a death to force some action  And will the politicians simply pass the buck or will they reflect on the part they have played in demonising those whose desperation is often the product of their social policies If MPs and TV companies are thinking about the consequences of their actions, it is incumbent on audiences to do the same as, by and large we get the TV we deserve. There is no shortage of good programmes at the moment. Dramas such as The Virtues challenge us to think about what it means to be depressed, to be troubled, to be on the fringes.If we want to stop people being treated as cannon fodder in a low-budget Hunger Games, then we should boycott those programmes and encourage others to do the same. But we should think beyond reality TV shows to the way the poor and the dispossessed are framed more generally, and ask: “Who benefits ”So long as those people are portrayed as feckless, sexually incontinent losers they will be judged as architects of their own downfalls, rather than victims of circumstance, thrown on the slagheap by a government intent on feathering its own nest.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"canadian feminist meghan murphy won t be silenced in scotland","story":"The woman at the centre of a growing debate over the impact on women#s rights oftrans people#s self-identication, has admitted she expects protests when she speaks at two events in Scotland this week, including at the Scottish Parliament.Meghan Murphy, a radical feminist from Canada, who was banned from Twitter after alleged “transphobic” comments, will address MSPs and other guests in Holyrood this Wednesday after being invited by SNP MSP Joan McAlpine. She is also due to speak at an event organised by women’s rights organisation ForWomenScot in Glasgow on Friday.In an exclusive interview with Scotland on Sunday, Murphy told how her le has changed dramatically since she started to raise questions about law changes around trans issues, losing work and iding her friends, and how she now fears for her personal safety.Murphy – a bête noir of the trans rights movement – says younger women have forgotten how hard previous generations of women fought for sex-based rights – an irony, she says, given the decisionlast week by Alabama to pass the US’s most restrictive abortion bill, banning it even when pregnancy is the result of rape or incest.“Women had to fight for decades just to get to vote and to access universities and get sex harassment laws passed… I mean, only very recently in Canada did female firefighters get their own locker rooms because they were being sexually harassed in shared ones… and you look at what’s happened in Alabama – yet all these laws and policies around trans- identying people are being passed so quickly and with so little scrutiny,” she says. “It’s all happening without looking at the impact on society and on women and girls in particular. I don’t know why this tiny minority of vocal trans activists have so much power – far more than women do. Women have been socialised for so long to put men’s feelings first – we had to fight so hard as women to say ‘No, I don’t have to put up with you’ – and that is all being reversed.“I think young women don’t have much knowledge around the history of the women’s movement. I don’t think they realise how hard they had to fight and how long this fight lasted – and how it’s still going on. When women were fighting for the rights we have now – which so many take for granted – those women were dismissed as crazy and radical. Young people think of all of that as insignicant. And that is upsetting.”Murphy, who has a degree in women’s studies and a masters in gender studies, had been writing on women’s issues for ten years. But it was only when Canada’s C Bill was being passed in , that she began to look at trans issues and their potential impact on women.“I’m not interested in stopping anyone having surgery or hormonesthey feel that’s making their lives better, and certainly people should be able to wear what they want and express themselves in ways that make them feel fulfilled and living authentic lives,” she says. “But once it became about laws and legislation and gender replacing sex it became clear to me that this would have a real impact on women’s rights and spaces.“The idea thatyou have a male body but feel you are, or should be, female then you have every right to be in women’s spaces – be that changing rooms, or shelters, or prisons – to me that was obviously going to have huge impact on women and there was no public discussion or debate. Laws were being passed and nobody was being consulted about it and there was no argument in the media. You just had to accept it or, as I found out when I started asking questions, you were a right-wing bigot.”The irony in being declared right-wing is not lost on Murphy, who grew up with a Marxist father. She describes herself as a “socialist feminist” but says being labelled right-wing is used by her detractors an “easy out” from engaging with her arguments. However, her views have been embraced by the farthest reaches of American conservatism, something which she says is “not comfortable” but at least shows “they are willing to engage” – while those on the left just want to silence her. Twitter has done just that. Tweets Murphy posted about “men not being women” got her suspended. Then when she tweeted “yes it’s him” in reference to a trans woman, who at the time was still going by the name Jonathan and who was suing female Canadian beauticians for refusing to give him a Brazilian wax, she was permanently excluded. She is now suing them, with her legal fees raised by donations. “Twitter is letting men off the hook,” she says. “They allow all sorts of hateful speech against women, yet when women speak the truth about male violence for instance, they are banned. The threats, the smears, the libels... it’s insane, but to Twitter it’s all OK. But ask a question about biology and you’re banned.” Murphy believes that social media has been used strategically by trans activists, allowing “trans ideology to be presented as mainstream”. She adds: “The vast majority of the population don’t believe it’s possible to change sex and certainly not through self-declaration.“I feel trans rights activists are dishonest – I don’t say trans women per se are a threat, I say men are a threat. The threat to women is not from trans, it’s from men. I don’t think all men are a threat, but what changes between a man being a man and a man identying as a woman “With self-identication we have all just got to believe a man is a woman because they say so – but what does identity mean, how is it defined  Without definition it makes being trans meaningless… just an empty word. To me a lot of this is about men once again wanting to remove women’s space and voices – it’s about male narcissism.”As well as the Twitter ban, which has affected her income in terms of work, her forthright views have affected her le in other ways She adds: “I think some people think I’m making a fortune out of all of this,” she says. “Nothing could be further from the truth. I have always been regarded as controversial as I don’t believe porn and prostitution are great for women unlike some third wave feminists. But this gender ID thing has blown things up. I find it odd because I never feel I’m saying anything crazy, just normal obvious things. “Vancouver is a small place and I’ve friends who’ve been stuck in the middle on this – the bullying really gets to me, as they’re pressed by others to reject me. I do get threats, I do worry about violence. I’m still just a writer. It’s been dficult.”Her visit to Scotland this week is one of the speaking engagements that followed her Twitter ban. SNP MSP Joan McAlpine has recently been vocal about reviewing the process to change Scotland’s gender recognition act, and she too has received threats and abuse as a result – even from within her own party, especially among younger members.Murphy says McAlpine is brave and says she’s grateful to have been invited to the Parliament. “I’m very much looking forward to meeting her and other women in Scotland fighting this issue. I wasn’t surprised to see how much backlash she got online though. I’m assuming that there’ll be protests as there are everywhere I go. “If any of them actually came into the events there’s no way they could accuse me of saying anything hateful. What I do say is let kids be themselves, don’t put them on hormones, don’t put young people through surgery. But of course they never come in. They don’t engage.” Canada, she says, is a lost cause in terms of re-asserting sex-based rights for women. The UK though she thinks, is dferent. “I’ve been so impressed by women’s organisations and campaigning in the UK,” she says. “It didn’t happen in Canada. And the media is also writing about it ,which raises people’s awareness. I think the fact you have politicians like Joan pushing back then there’s a chance to stop it [self ID] and turn it around.” ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon independence vote by 2021 even if uk stays in eu","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has signalled that her timetable for a second independence referendum before  will remainthe UK chooses to stay in the EU.The First Minister said she would “not necessarily” abandon her independence plans eventhere is a second EU referendum that reverses Brexit, citing the risk of Boris Johnson becoming Prime Minister.: Brexit: Jim Sillars says its \"impossible\" to vote for pro-EU SNPShe set out her ambition to hold a second vote on Scotland’s constitutional future before the next Holyrood election in , despite the UK Government’s insistence that it will not grant the Scottish Government the powers to do so.Asked on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show whether a vote to remain in the EU “removes the need for an imminent Scottish independence referendum”, Ms Sturgeon said: “Not necessarily, no, because I think things are changing rapidly.“The last thing I think I should be doing right now is narrowing Scotland’s options.“We could be facing the prospect in the near future of Boris Johnson as Prime Minister so the last thing I should be doing is narrowing Scotland’s options.“I think after all of the experience of the last three years, Scotland should have the opportunity to decide whether we want to become an independent European nation.”Scottish Conservative chief whip Maurice Golden said: “Nicola Sturgeon has used Brexit as an excuse for pursuing a second independence referendum for the last three years.: Nicola Sturgeon: Prospect of Boris Johnson as PM would be ‘nightmare’ for Scotland“Today she has confirmed what we knew all along – Brexit was always just a fig leaf to hide her only real priority.“Whether the UK is in or out of the EU, her answer will always be the same - independence.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Spread the remain vote around, that will show them. United we stand!!! Nowyou want out of the EU, go for the Brexit Party. UKIP with theirTommy thug is a nonsence, as for May, lets leave that for gathering nuts!!!Forgive meI am wrong here but did not the SNP campaign most vigorously during the Independence Campaign to take Scotland out of the United Kingdom and that would have resulted in Scotland no longer being in the European Union. Is this woman being disingenuous or is she just plain stupid  Does she really believe our memories are so short  Just why would anyone follow the SNP  Nicola Sturgeon being investigated under her own Ministerial code for her handling of the Salmond allegations and nothing at all can further legally be said. I think no messages need be said to May from the SNP, perhaps Farage would put the message across with a lot more credibility.#Scotland#s future lies in Europe.# LOL. They never stop, do they, no matter how often it#s pointed out that IndyScotland will be automatically out of the EU # with #No Deal# # on the same day that we leave the UK.This has been officially confirmed to the both the House of Lords and the Scottish Parliament by EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barrosoand his deputy Viviane Reding , respectively.It seems the SNP will also #drag Scots out of the EU#,they get their way with independence.I#ve just had a letter from Willie Rennie. He thinks the Scottish elections are on  May!Ian smears Nicola Sturgeon then claims“nothing further legally can be said” in his latest charm offensive. Apparently the ancient legal maxim innocent-until-proven-guilty doesn’t apply to women he judges “disengenuous or just plain stupid”.Ian must love his prejudices dearly to flaunt them in such unapologetically intolerant and illiberal clothes. Was he always so delightful Boris and Nigel, the UK has leadership at last! What a pair to lead us out. I love being delightful Peter. Weep on.Brexit, in short, is nothing more than the Tories wanting to disconnect the UK from the EU, and connect itself directly to the USA, purely for themto benefit from the privatising of most government responsibilities and duties of care to US companies. It is, regrettably, as simple as that. Brexit, was nothing to do with the greater good for everybody, but for the few who would benefit####typical tory policy, # look after number , and screw everybody  in the process #, political ideology.*If* the Tories intent is to disconnect the UK from the EU and connect it directly to the USA, why is everything the government has put on the table so far and fought hard to sell to the nation as #Brexit#, proposals that will KEEP the nation well and truly in the EU in all but name, but on considerably worse terms than our current membership As far as I am aware Michael, % of British businesses deal with the EU. However, this is separate from the business of Government, and its duties to serve the people and the country. It is well known the Tories would love to privatise most Government#s responsibilities and duties of care to the private sector, where they themselves would benefit. It is also well known, the preferred country outwith the UK, to takeover such responsibilities to be the USA. Yes, the Government has a partial responsibility to acknowledge a large part of British business deals with the EU###as said though, international business and Government responsibility are two separate issues. The Government would prefer private business to take over their duties and respnsibilities no matter how you paint the picture.Less and less businesses are doing transactions in the Britishstate,with the isolationists causing a £ billion net outflow of over £ billion of assets to be shted because of brexit , # before it even commences.The main winners have been Luxembourg and Dublin,a factor maybe in why Ireland is progressing towards being the third wealthiest nation by .The separatists loss and Europe#s gain.@ David Spence.Just about every so-called Brexit #deal# put in front of parliament by the current Tories has included some element of a customs union with the EU. *If* the Tories intent is to detach from the EU and attach to the USA, the quickest, easiest and simplest method would be a #no deal# Brexit, which is something they seem intent on committing electoral suicide to avoid considering. The evidence doesn#t support your claim that the Tories want to detach from the EU and attach to the USA, as anything less than a #no deal# Brexit makes such a transition more dficult to establish and sustain.What evidence is there that the Government wants #private business to take over their duties and responsibilities#, and what#s wrong with itthey are  Private business left to market forces but subject to an effective statutory regulatory framework, is far more capable of providing a VFM service than any Government.Evenit doesn#t work, its only for a max of  years, then we vote in someone  to change it. There is no need to fear change not cast in tablets of stone.In fairness Ian has also previously judged Alex Salmond guilty before the facts, but still, theres evidence of something  in his earlier attack. Ian asked: “Is this woman being disingenuous or is she just plain stupid ” He could instead have asked“Nicola Sturgeon”, or “the First Minister” or even“she” was being disingenuous or just plain stupid. Instead Ian opted to emphasise her gender by starting with “this woman”. Five words later Ian added an otherwise redundant “she”, lest readers had forgotten his target wasn’t male.This from the same Ian who is fond of saying gender is not an issue. Doth Ian protest too much Ian made his smear more effective by offering a choice between two negatives in his rhetorical “or” question. The First Minister can only be a liar or an idiot. Neat trick! So was Ian being bigoted or merely mean and nasty  All three possibly.More fair-minded folk than Ian wouldn’t judge on the discourse analysis of one sentence alone. Ian mightn’t have purposefully considered each word in advance. But isn’t unwitting misogyny misogyny nonetheless  Happily for Ian, he appears to enjoyloathing indiscriminately, with one notable far-right exception. All hail Farage!Have you told Qatar, Singapore, Brunei Darussalam, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Switzerland, Hong Kong SAR and Norway that Graham  They are all outside the EU, wealthier than Ireland and guess what outside the UU we can trade with all of them on our own terms! As well as every other nation on the planet!!!!!Enough said,you want real change and loath Farage, hold your nose and vote Brexit Party. If you want real influence, join the Brexit Party and help create its policies.

As we face into the new mandate it is high time to effectively deliver on the long-promised aspiration of Belfast as a ‘Diverse City of Equals’.The Gaeltacht Quarter Board has long engaged with Council but Council has failed, thus far, to break down the reluctance of some to embrace and promote the Gaeltacht Quarter as one of the vibrant, open and welcoming quarters of the city and as an asset for residents and tourists alike. Given the make-up of the new Council we would hope to see progress in this regard. Here are some points we would like you to consider.# Unionists are now the smallest combined voting block in Council# Unionists can only muster  votes# That is  votes short of a majority# Unionists can no longer block the aspiration for Belfast as a Diverse City of Equals# No-one now needs to do deals with unionists in Belfast to deliver for citizens in a non-partisan way# Parties can now develop and promote fair and equitable policies, which are Section  compliant, without needing to seek unionist approval or unionist votes# Parties can garner working majorities without allowing Alliance to play the role of arbiter# The combined Alliance and unionist vote is , two votes short of a majority# If parties continuedoing deals with unionism they must explainit is to deliver on voters’ aspirations or for other more expedient reasons.Combined Non-Unionist Strength with Alliance –  votes.Sinn Féin Alliance SDLP Greens People Before Profit Combined Non-Unionist Strength without Alliance  votes.Sinn Féin SDLP Greens People Before Profit "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"christopher looks to the future at newington cu","story":"HAVING studied drama at Queen’s University, a younger Christopher McBride could hardly have imagined he would one day become a Director at Newington Credit Union.However, the -year-old accountant’s thespian ambitions exited the stage when he realised he “couldn’t do accents”. He good-humouredly reflects on his lack of accomplishment in that department as a skill he “kind of needed” to carve out a career in drama. Luckily, he has found both fulfilment and success not only in his day job in the finance industry, but also through his work at the local credit union.Christopher has been a lelong member of Newington Credit Union, which was founded in  by his grandfather, Sean Caughey. Since coming on board as a Director in December , Christopher has striven to make a dference in the local community like his grandfather before him.“My granddad founded the credit union so that the local community would have somewhere they could save money, where everyone could pool together their resources so thatpeople needed a loan then there would be that central community hub that they could use and that’s something we’re doing to this very day,” he said.“I feel the credit union is really important. When I was in England I spoke to people about the credit union model and they were amazed because they don’t have the same focus on credit unions.In the last few years we’ve seen the controversy theresurrounding payday loan companies with massive interest rates, but that might not have happenedthere were credit unions. People who would otherwise have gone to a payday lender can come to the credit union and get a rate where they won’t be exploited, which is very important. I wanted to be able to help the credit union by using my expertise in accountancy to help its development.“I’ve been involved with the monthly meetings where we look at how the credit union is progressing. It’s really to make sure that we are continuing to serve our purpose. I have started to get involved in the investment committee to look at what we are doing with our money. I’m also involved in trying to get more people to join the credit union. For me, it’s very important to get more people – especially young people – involved in the credit union.”During his short time as a Newington Credit Union Director, Christopher has overseen an upsurge in members following a highly successful recruitment drive in March – something he says he is “very proud of”. He is also spearheading the credit union’s efforts to bring in a erse range of volunteers to help develop the organisation.“I want to get more Directors on board,” he said. “I’m one of the younger directors on the board, so I want to get more people my age involved. It’s good to have people from a range of backgrounds and it’s a good way to get involved with the local community. I really wanted to improve the North Belfast area, it’s something that I’m quite passionate about, so getting on board has really helped me do that. A lot of people think thatthey don’t have a financial or business background that they can’t get involved, but that’s not the case.“I came from a drama background and became a director, so the only real qualication is that you want to help develop the Credit Union and the local community.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"church leaders meet stormont politicians","story":"LEADERS of the Catholic, Presbyterian, Anglican and Methodist churches in Ireland have held talks with Stormont parties in the latest attempt to break the political deadlock.British and Irish Ministers including Secretary of State Karen Bradley also attended the meeting on Tuesday.The delegation of church leaders told the Stormont parties it was time to demonstrate courageous political leadership.Archbishop Richard Clarke said: #One of the messages we tried to send today is that in a vacuum, other forces will move into that vacuum and take control of it.#And for that reason, there is this absolutely huge need to ensure that somehow, normal political le starts again.#Archbishop Eamon Martin added, “If we don’t sit around the table and talk, then what  ”Following the meeting, Sinn Féin leader in the north Michelle O’Neill said: “All of society has a stake in this process so we very much welcome the start of a broad engagement with wider society beginning with the church leaders that were at Stormont today and we thank them for their contribution.“We want to meet with a wide range of civic society, all the churches, the trade unions, business organisations, womens groups, language groups, the community and voluntary sector and everyone out there because this process and these institutions belong to us all.“These talks have the potential to restore the power-sharing institutions and that is the best way to ensure that the next generation benefits from the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process.“We all know what the outstanding issues are. We believe they can and must be resolved so Sinn Féin will continue to engage in these talks with positivity and a determination to do the business.“None of the issues are insurmountable or unresolvable. Agreement can be reached and the institutions restored with the positive political will and support of all parties and both governments.“The way forward is through implementation of agreements already made, safeguarding rights enjoyed by citizens in the rest of Ireland and in Britain, and delivering good governance.”DUP leader Arlene Foster added, “Getting the Assembly back up and running immediately would be a courageous thing to do, a compassionate thing to do and the right thing to do.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"eastwood optimistic at taking third euro seat","story":"SDLP leader Colum Eastwood says his party are in the “best position” to take a seat in the European Parliament.There are  candidates battling for seats in the north with sitting MEPs Sinn Féin’s Martina Anderson and DUP’s Diane Dodds expected to win a seat following next Thursday’s election.A LuicdTalk poll, published by The Times, has predicted that Mr Eastwood would received more first preference votes than the UUP and Alliance in the fight for the final seat. On a visit to Lisburn’s city centre-based Atlas Women’s Centre, which is EU funded, Colum Eastwood told Daily Belfast that his party are “clearly in the best position to take that seat.”“We have had a fantastic response. We’ve set out to run a very positive pro-European anti-Brexit campaign because I think we have the most credibility in terms of being opposed to Brexit, opposed to the referendum happening. “We are unequivocal in our opposition to it. We think there is an opportunity to now send a very positive pro- European anti-Brexit message by electing two Remain MEPs and we think that’s key becausewe elected two Leavers that would be sending the wrong message as to what people in Northern Ireland think about Brexit.“It’s within our grasp. The was a poll a few weeks ago which had us in fourth position, there was a poll two days ago which put us in third position so out of all the good Remain candidates were are clearly in the best position to take that seat,” he said.He continued: “We want people to lend us their support, even just for this one election, to send a clear anti-Brexit message. People voted in  to Remain,  per cent. I think that numberit was tested again would be through the roof. People have watched the Brexit process unfold with horror they are deeply concerned about the impact it is going to have here, on our economy, our society, our peace process. People do not want to go backwards.“We are trying to take John Hume’s seat back and I think we can do it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sdlp condemn flying of parachute regiment flag","story":"SDLP MLA Pat Catney says he is working with both the PSNI and Department for Infrastructurein a bid to remove a Parachute Regiment flag from the Thaxton Village roundabout in Lisburn.The erection of the contentious flag comes after several were previously flown in parts of North Belfast at the junction of the Oldpark Road and Ballysilian Road. It is understood the flags were put up to show ‘solidarity’ with ‘Soldier F’ who faces prosecution over the killings of two people on Bloody Sunday in . It comes at a time when the Ballymurphy Massacre inquest is taking place,  years after the Parachute Regiment killed  people in West Belfast in August .Mr Catney said that both agencies have responded to him “and I will continue to liaise with the Department and the PSNI to get this matter resolved”.“The whole flags question is a political issue which can be resolved through the Flags Commission and the SDLP will also put this issue on the talks agenda.“The soldier in question must be subject to the due process of the law and banners of support, like statements of condemnation, will not advance the cause of justice or address the anxiety of the families in any way.“We are trying and working to build a shared community here, we are working for good relations.

This busy stretch of the Falls Road has no shortage of eateries and past experience has shown that it takes real quality to last there but, luckily, quality is something Tuckers has in abundance.The Gaeltacht Quarter is a hive of business activity and is also home to St Mary’s University College, so a good rule of thumb when choosing somewhere to dine during office hours is to follow the local workforce and students. When my colleagues and I visited Tuckers at lunchtime on Thursday it was bustling with precisely that type of clientele. Having already tried one of their impressive sausage rolls during a passing visit on one Saturday morning, I had already planned ato sample some more of the items on their enticing menu.Upon entering, we were shown to our table by our waitress Nicola, who also happens to head up the business alongside her partner, Dale. The interior of Tuckers is brightly decorated giving it a casual and laidback feel. Illustrations and sketches from local artist Joseph McGuinness also adorn the walls – an enjoyable touch that was admired during our visit.Since this was my first proper Tuckers experience, I felt that having a go at the fry was essential. Universally adored, the fry is the staple of most good café’s and Tuckers did not disappoint. Simply billed as the full Irish fry, this sizeable offering had all the hallmarks of a classic. Two slices of thick-cut bacon, two quality butcher style pork sausages, fresh vegetable roll, black and white pudding and a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg were served alongside the usual trimmings as well as a welcome hash brown. Given its sheer proportions, this fry is not for the faint hearted, however, with each bite as good as the first, I had no problem finishing it off.Across the table, my colleague opted for the burger, which was served with nicely seasoned and crisp French fries. While I was obliged in tasting a few of the fries, my colleague was unlikely to part with any piece of his burger. Served in a soft floury bun, the burger was expertly cooked – seared on the outside and moist on the inside.A no-nonsense club sandwich made up the rest of the order fresh ingredients properly assembled and served with a generous portion of fries.After washing everything down with several cups of tea, we left Tuckers feeling full and satisfied. The friendly service and wide range of excellent mains, sandwiches, pastries and deli items would be reason enough for anyone to pay this local gem a visit. Despite having opened its doors just six months ago, Tuckers has already established itself as a firm favourite on the Falls Road.

A Europe-wide embargo means the first results in that poll cannot be declared to pm that night. If previous elections are a guide, counting is likely to continue through into Monday.Counting in the mayoral plebiscites is likely to get underway in the three impacted cities on the Monday.The European and local government elections will be the first electoral test for Ireland’s main parties since the inconclusive general election of .The result delivered a hung parliament and precipitated months of negotiations between Fine Gael and Fianna Fail, two parties with a century-old enmity dating back to Ireland’s Civil War.A historic accord emerged that saw Fianna Fail agree to support a minority Fine Gael-led government through a confidence and supply deal for three years. The parties renewed that arrangement late last year, extending what has been dubbed an era of “new politics” until early .\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Former Fine Gael taoiseach Enda Kenny struck a historic confidence and supply deal with Fianna Fail leader Micheal MartinWhile Friday’s elections focus on European and council issues, the results will no doubt be interpreted as a public judgment on Fine Gael’s performance in government and how effectively Fianna Fail has managed the delicate balancing act of holding an administration to account while at the same time propping it up.Other smaller parties in the Oireachtas parliament, such as Sinn Fein, the Green Party and Labour, will hope to be the beneficiaries of any potential public disaffection with “new politics”.In Northern Ireland, the European election will be held a day earlier – along with the rest of the UK on Thursday – and counting will begin a day later, due to historic reticence to count on a Sunday.There are three seats up for grabs but it would represent a seismic political shockthe two largest parties north of the border – the pro-Brexit DUP and anti-Brexit Sinn Fein – failed to hold on to their respective seats.So, realistically, only the third seat is in play, with the Ulster Unionists facing a tough fight to hold it.

The fate of the third seat, held by the retiring Ulster Unionist Jim Nicholson, is less certain.Speaking at the launch of the Alliance manesto at the CIYMS sports grounds in east Belfast yesterday, Mrs Long said her party is best placed to take that seat.The party manesto includes pledges to secure a peoples vote, keep borders open, protect the economy and support the work of the EU.Mrs Long said: \"The recent council election results, in addition with a number of polls and surveys, show Alliance is in prime position to not only substantially increase our number of first preference votes but also gain the required transfers from others to take the third seat and show the EU, and indeed the world, Northern Ireland wants to Remain.\"Brexit is not an orange or green issue and I am not an orange or green politician.\"In , people right across our community came together to vote Remain. I believe we can achieve better together and show that same spirit again on May .\"Mrs Long said she believes Northern Irelands third seat is going to come down to transfers, and urged voters totwo Remain candidates.\"In the recent polls that have been produced, we are literally within the margin of error, neck-and-neck with the Ulster Unionists and the SDLP,\" she said.\"The Ulster Unionists are the current incumbent, and its very clearwe are neck-and-neck with the current incumbent, we are in contention for that seat.\"Unlike the Ulster Unionists who are moving backwards, and the SDLP who have been drting backwards, we have forward momentum, so the opportunity is there for us to attract crucial transfers because that is what will decide the last seat, not just the first preference votes but how many transfers we can draw from across the board,\" she said.\"Thats why I am encouraging people who vote Alliance to vote for other pro-remain candidates after they have voted Alliance number one, and I would hope that other pro-Remain candidates will want to do the same.\"Its important we have two voices in Europe who are pro-Remain, who are making a strong statement to government about how Northern Ireland feels about the EU,\" the Alliance leader said.\"But I believe it is also important that we have a voice there that is not simply a unionist or nationalist voice, that doesnt further polarise this issue but that can represent the broad swathe of public opinion and civic society. And I believe I am best placed to do that.\"Alliance’s key manesto prioritiesReinforcing progressive values. Alliance said it believes in “strength through ersity, respecting people, enabling opportunities, protecting rights and inclusion”.Supporting work of the EU. The manesto states Northern Ireland’s participation in the EU brings huge advantages.Protecting our economy. It says the Customs Union and Single Market “provide massive economic opportunities to our manufacturing, agri-food and service sectors”.Keeping open borders. Alliance believes any form of Brexit risks new isions and barriers, adding: “We must keep the open borders throughout these islands, and preserve everyone’s freedom to trade and live their lives freely.” Securing a people’s vote. Alliance wants a fresh referendum, with Remain on the ballot.

Instead I will ask them to look at a new and improved deal with fresh pairs of eyes – and to give it their support.”Mrs May has said she will bring the WAB before MPs for its second reading vote in the first week of June following the short Whitsun recess.Regardless of how the vote goes, she will then meet the chairman of the Tory backbench  Committee, Sir Graham Brady, to agree a timetable to elect her successor as party leader, paving the way for her departure from No .The Prime Minister expected to set out details of her WAB proposals in a major speech before the end of the month.But after three previous attempts to get her deal through the Commons went down to hefty defeats, many Tory MPs are sceptical that her fourth will fare any better.You can watch the movie Titanic a hundred times, but Im afraid the ship sinks every timeNigel Evans MPAnother defeat would almost certainly see a ratcheting up of demands for her to go immediately, amid intense frustration at her failure to deliver on the  referendum result.Nigel Evans, the executive secretary of the , said: “You can watch the movie Titanic a hundred times, but I’m afraid the ship sinks every time.“An increasing number of Conservative MPs – even those who voted for it a second or third time – are saying enough is enough.”Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, who led Labour’s negotiating team, was also doubtful that a fresh attempt would succeed.With Mrs May on her way out, he said that a key reason for the failure of the talks was the fear her successor could simply tear up any agreement they reached.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Sir Keir Starmer said a second referendum could break the parliamentary impasse “The Prime Minister said before we started the talks she would be going,” he told the BBC Radio  Today programme.“It did mean that during the talks, almost literally as we were sitting in the room talking, cabinet members and wannabe Tory leaders were torpedoing the talks with remarks about not being willing to accept a customs union.“It put the Prime Minister in a position where she was too weak to deliver, in our opinion.”This morning I wrote to Theresa May to say that talks on finding a compromise agreement for leaving the European Union have gone as far as they can.The governments growing weakness and instability mean there cannot be confidence in its ability to deliver. pic QkIvuDBX— Jeremy CorbynMay , Sir Keir was himself blamed by allies of the Prime Minister for scuppering the talks through his support for a second referendumThe shadow Brexit secretary said that including a “confirmatory” public vote in the WAB could still end the parliamentary impasse.Others in Labour – including party leader Jeremy Corbyn – are less enthusiastic about the prospect of another referendum and it is unclear whether it could win a majority in the Commons."},{"url":null,"title":"southampton fc release new kit with fyre festivalstyle mockumentary","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Balmoral ShowNorth West NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The film tells the story of -year-olds, Conchita Gonzalez, Jacinta Gonzalez, and Maria Loli Mazon and -year-old Maria Cruz Gonzalez, who were all from poor families living in San Sebastian de Garabandal, in the Santander Province, and who had been playing together on the outskirts of the town on the evening of June , , when they claim that they heard a loud noise and saw the bright figure of St Michael the Archangel.They said that the Archangel appeared to them again, in the same place, in the days that followed, announcing to them that they would see Our Lady on July . After this first encounter, the girls claimed to have over , visits from Our Lady of Mount Carmel, referred to as such because the girls said that her appearance and dress looked like portrayals of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.The film also portrays the struggle that the village’s parish priest, Fr Valentin, and Civil Guard brigadier, Mr Juan Alez Seco found themselves in to find out the truth, while confronting a perplexed hierarchy and facing an ever growing multitude of people arriving at the village in search of answers.The girls reported that the purpose of the visitations was to call for a “conversion of heart”, and that they had received two messages, one on October , , directly from Our Lady and the other via St Michael on June , . The visionaries also claimed that Our Lady had told them of a “warning”, a “miracle” and a “punishment”,the call to conversion was not heeded.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe warning is described as a momentary stopping of time around the world, with all people then seeing the spiritual condition of their souls, and how they should amend their ways. Within a year of this, it is reported that the miracle will take place, which will leave a permanent sign in Garabandal – one that can be seen and photographed, but not touched. While the reported apparitions have not been approved by the Church, authorities maintain a conservative attitude towards them. In accordance with usual procedure concerning claimed visitations, the local bishop has primary jurisdiction. Past practice regarding approved apparitions indicates that in the absence of clear supernatural proof, neither the local bishop nor Rome is likely to approve an apparition.Following two committees convened by the bishops of Santander, they declared that there were no phenomena capable of authenticating the facts as undoubtedly supernatural, but they did not condemn the message. The first commission stated: “We find nothing in need of ecclesiastical censure or condemnation, neither in the doctrine nor in the spiritual recommendations supposedly addressed to the faithful.” On his retirement, Bishop Juan Antonio del Val, who called the second commission, stated that “the message of Garabandal was important and theologically correct”.Brunswick Cinebowl is located at Brunswick Lane, Pennyburn Industrial Estate, Derry. Bookings for the film will be taken from Wednesday, May . The Box Office can be contacted on  .  The film will also be screened in Cookstown, in The Ritz Multiplex, - Burn Road, on Sunday, May , with moves being made for it to be shown in Belfast too.One of the actors in the film will be in attendance at the launch.Juan Romero plays the role of the Jesuit priest, Fr.

Ms McKee was shot dead on  April last by a masked New IRA gunman as she reported on ongoing riots in the Creggan area.Ruddys tribute has been recognised by the late Ms McKee’s partner, Sara Canning, who was extremely touched by his homage to the woman who was to become her we.Speaking to Derry News yesterday, Ruddy said: “It was so sad but I didnt realise just how sad until I heard more about Lyra on Jeremy Vine. That is when I knew I had to do something. I never expected it would lead to talking to Sara but it was so emotional. Just doing the pic was tearful but the reaction was very touching.“I am not sure I will ever understand. We are all humans and a mutual respect is what we should all strive and hope for.”When Ruddy first posted the piece on Facebook the week after Ms McKee’s murder, he said: “I know I have other pieces but had to do this one after hearing all about Lyra McKee on the the Jeremy Vine Show. Was crying for the whole piece. What an amazing woman.”Ruddy then asked on the Facebook post what words he should add to artwork and the most requested response was #notinmyname.Ms Canning saw and appreciated the artwork and thanked Ruddy for featuring Ms McKee.In a Facebook exchange, she wrote: “Fantastic. So powerful... she’d be so embarrassed but secretly massively pleased. It’s beautul, like her.”Ruddy replied: “Thank you so much. All of my thoughts are with you.

The words I have heard have been so swollen with love.”Meanwhile, Derry will remember the talented journalist a month after she was shot dead on the streets of Creggan as her friends and family vow they \"won’t let her memory and name dissolve.\"A Month’s Mind Mass will be held tonight in St Mary’s Chapel, Creggan, at .pm celebrated by Fr Joseph Gormley, the priest who gave the - year-old the Last Rites on the night she was shot dead. It will be followed by \"Love for Lyra,\" a gathering at the Peace Flame at .pm, in the Peace Garden adjacent to the Guildhall.Kathleen Bradley, a close friend of Ms McKee, said the Mass and public event would allow people to honour and remember her friend in an inclusive, religious and non-religious way.“We arranged a Month’s Mind Mass and the Love for Lyra event because it’s all still a shock to us and we know that it’s still a shock to the wider public,” she said.“Everyone is still grieving for Lyra, even people that didn’t know her ,and we are very conscious of others needing some kind of outlet to show that grief and support for Sara and Lyra’s family. So, we decided to have the Mass and a non-religious event.”Ms Bradley said that another reason for organising public events was to keep the profile of what happened to her dear friend a priority so that her murderer will be brought to justice.“It’s been a month and, while it is great that there have been arrests, Lyra’s murderer still hasn’t been arrested,” she said.\"We won’t let what happened

Therersquos a team of around  of us at the practice and they are all brilliant.While Jane collected the Young Clinician of The Year award, one of the most sought-after accolades in Scottish dentistry, her practice was also shortlisted for the dental team of the year award, narrowly missing out on the night.A major part of Janersquos success is her ability to reassure young children and other nervous patients.She says that half are affected by previous poor experiences where, while the other % simply have an irrational fear.She said: ldquoWith kids I want to do anything I can to put them at ease so that in the future they will always see visiting the dentist as a positive experience.ldquoI will do whatever it takes, eventhat means having a tea party on the floor to persuade a child to hop into the seat. And Irsquove lost count of the number of treatments Irsquove performed on teddies.Elsewhere, Jane has also become the go-to dentist in the Highlands for working with autistic children after her name was shared repeatedly across Facebook groups set up by parents of children on the autism spectrum.Having grown up in Ballynahinch, she says that her love of the Irish lsquocraicrsquo has also helped her build a powerful rapport with patients by chatting about their families, hobbies, interests and personal lives.She explained: ldquoOne of my best successes was a young bride-to-be whorsquod damaged her teeth in a car accident. She was already nervous about getting in the chair and the fact her big day was coming up made it even worse.ldquoIt was round the time I was planning my own wedding, so I knew exactly how important wedding photos would be.ldquoIt was challenging because she was so nervous. But we overcame that and also got a brilliant result on her teeth with a combination of really nice white fillings, a couple of crowns and a wee bit of Invisalign braces to do a bit of straightening.ldquoNot only did she look absolutely beautul for her wedding, but six months later she was back for her next check-up, hopped into the chair and was totally relaxed. That was so rewarding to see.Jane met her husband, Martin Hier, while undergoing punishing training at a gym in Inverness. The couple both regularly compete in triathlons and Iron Man events.As well as working full-time, Jane is also studying towards a diploma ndash and a later a masterrsquos degree ndash in restorative dentistry. She also finds time to volunteer on the RNLIrsquos Kessock leboat, an Atlantic  class boat.

Now these bad experiences are to surface again. And all in a strange and frightening environment. Our role is to give them the best support we can and deliver a caring and professional service.ldquoSome young witnesses appear to be calm. Others arrive visibly distressed. Some may appear totally indferent. In common though, they all have inner fears. I have heard young witnesses say they just want to get the day, or days, over, put it all behind them, move on.Judith said days at court can be long, intensive and wearing, explaining thatand when the time comes to give evidence, the young witnesses are now faced with their greatest fear mdash that of giving evidence.She explained how when the time came for the young witness to give evidence, it would be just the two of them alone in a room with a video-link.ldquoI must be a strong, quiet presence and remain so even when hearing harrowing evidence, said Judith. ldquoThis highly-charged time in the video-link room can be sharp, splintering and painful.ldquoWhen that ordeal is finally over the young witness can sometimes stay with us waiting to hear a judgement. This may bring relief, or, bring unwelcome news. Emotions can be mixed and unpredictable.Judith said she regretted the ordeals and traumas that the young witness had to face but marvels at their bravery and strength, adding: ldquoIt is truly a privilege to support these young people.Anyone interested in volunteering for the Young Witness Service is asked to contact Billy Eagleson on    or email billy.eagleson@nspcc.org.uk.

However, all three are capable of handling the big occasion and they could well form the basis of the Down defence.In attack, Down should have Glasdrummanrsquos Connaire Harrison fully fit again and his partnership with Burrenrsquos Donal OrsquoHare is central to Tallyrsquos aspirations.This duo have the ability to unlock any defence and the task of supplying them with good ball could fall to McKernan, Kilcoorsquos Paul Devlin and brothers Jerome and Ryan Johnston, and Clonduffrsquos Barry OrsquoHagan.Kieran McGeeney, now in his fth year in charge at Armagh, was able to get Armagh to hold their own in Division , but the Orchard County, although doing well in the Qualiers, have yet to win a game in Ulster under their former captain.Theof Stefan Campbell and Jamie Clarke this season and Rian OrsquoNeillrsquos arrival gives the Armagh a serious cutting edge and they could just be too sharp for Down to handle.The last time Down played Armagh in the Ulster Championship was only two years ago and the job of nullying Clarkersquos influence on the game was handed to Darren OrsquoHagan mdash a marking job that enabled Down to record a notable win.ldquoGoing into that game Oisin McConville was saying that Armagh had one of the best full-forward lines in the country and yet they were still in Division , the Down captain said.Sundayrsquos game canrsquot come quick enough for the Clonduff man and he expects a tough, hard-hitting encounter and fireworks from start to finish.ldquoItrsquos a local derby. Therersquos definitely no love lost. Itrsquos real. People probably think itrsquos not, but here has to be that hatred there, he remarked.ldquoItrsquos like Clonduff playing Kilcoo. I know all the Kilcoo players, but once theyrsquore wearing a dferent jersey on the field you hate them. You need that mdash you need that bit of hunger. Thatrsquos why you play county football.ldquoI want to win. I love playing county football and I think Paddy Tally will get an Ulster title out of Down. I donrsquot knowit will happen this year, next year or in three years, but I do think he can build a team that could do it, he added.ldquoYou set out every year to win andwe beat Armagh it will be massive for us..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Tributes paid to former Down Council director Bob Arnott  ","story":"A FORMER Down Council director who was chairman of the Northern Ireland Kidney Research Fund has passed away.Mr Bob Arnott mdash who was in s mdash was heralded as playing a crucial role in supporting medical research that has helped to change lives around the world.He was also regarded as a beacon of hope for people who spend time on the waiting list for a kidney transplant.Billy Thompson, vice-chairman of the Kidney Research Fund, said Mr Arnott played a very large and invaluable role in the organisation from its very early stages.ldquoHe was so passionate about the importance of organ transplants and he helped to raise awareness of the importance of research and of organ donations, said Mr Thompson.ldquoNorthern Ireland now leads the way in kidney transplants and ranks highly in Europe for having the highest number of living kidney donations.Mr Thompson said Mr Arnott also played a leading part in growing the charity to what it is today.He added: ldquoOver the years we have helped to fund research which has resulted in papers on renal failure being presented at medical conferences around the world.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries.

I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them.

I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain. The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/border_1.jpg","title":"trusted trader status could help ni firms with brexit","story":"Posted on Monday May  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland exporters could avoid some of the damaging impact and friction of a hard Brexit by adopting the Government’s ‘trusted trader’ status, Ulster Business can reveal.According to Safeguard AEO, a firm which assists businesses in getting the green light for the so-called Authorised Economic Operatortrading quality mark, the global arrangement could help firms avoid heavy friction with trade, following Brexit.The status is a quality marker, which the Government says allows businesses to fast-track shipments through customs, and is something which could be crucialthe UK leaves the EU without a deal.And while such an arrangement has not yet been firmed up by the Government, Richard Thompson of Safeguard AEO believes it’s something which is seriously being considered.According to figures reported by the BBC,  applications for AEO were received between June  and January this year, with fewer than half the applications being approved.“It is dependent on the arrangement that is put in place between Dublin and say Belfast,” Mr Thompson says.“If you are moving stuff from the north to the south, then that accreditation will be recognised in the south, and those goods could just move .”The AEO is a global scheme, which was first introduced by the World Customs Organisation .The firm provides software and support to both small and large firms, taking them through a green, amber and red light system for the ious stages of the complex AEO system, ensuring each area meets the correct standards before the application is submitted.“Businesses should be thinking very seriously about getting this accreditation. Either, they will need it when we leave, or they will need itwe stay,” Mr Thompson said.The status applies primarily to physical goods being transported across customs areas, including manufacturers, agri-business and general retail.Martin Dubbey, managing director of Safeguard AEO, said: “The big concern is not just the Northern Ireland border with the Republic. You also have  HGVs coming out every day down to the port, and then across.“I think there has to be some sort of fudge .”Meanwhile, Karen Wheeler, who heads the UK Border Delivery Group, has told a group of businesses here that there is no magic technological solution for preventing a hard border in Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/gym_1.jpg","title":"new exercise business for city centre hotel","story":"Posted on Tuesday May  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest hotel will soon be punching well above its weight as a new exercise business sets up shop, Ulster Business can reveal.Fitness franchise Round has been growing in the UK at a steady pace, and will open its doors later this month at the Grand Central Hotel in Belfast city centre.Rather than running on a set schedule, a new Round session starts every three minutes, allowing a new workout every day, including a range of weight resistance, cardio and core-strength training.The company is one of the first brands in the UK to utilise wearable heart-rate technology, and class participants wear heart rate monitors, which are hooked up to a big screen in the gym.It’s understood Round Belfast will be opening in May .

Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"could a new dawn boost ni business development","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business While Brexit is still upon us, John Simpson says the business sectors finances have proved stronger than predicted and lending could be boosted on the outside as the veil of uncertainty lts The darkest hour comes just before the dawn: an apt reference to the prospects when Brexit is finally taken out of the daily diet of news, concern about business disruption, and foreboding about dficult trading prospects. Brexit is proving to be a slow departure. This year the economy has proved more resilient than many feared. Employment has remained at high levels, jobs for skilled employees are available, and with less certainty personal incomes have been maintained.Political uncertainty and efficient business management are an uneasy mix. In the recent winter and springbusinesses have had to live with an intense series of destabilising influences. For over  years, businesses in Ireland and the UK have grown accustomed to near frictionless EU market conditions. customs duties had disappeared on all internal EU trading. For businesses on this island, the memory of cross-border customs duties had all been but forgotten.   Looking at the lending performances of some of our own banks, the numbers seem to be adding up. In its full year accounts for , Danske Bank posted pre-tax profit of £.m, while new lending rose % and overall business lending increased by %.Across Donegall Square, Ulster Bank saw its income rising from £m to £m during , while profit after impairments stood at £m. There was a % rise in new corporate lending, while small business rose by %.Meanwhile, across the UK as a whole, Barclays has announced a £bn lending fund as part of a series of initiatives to help small and medium-sized businessesto succeed and flourish through Brexit and beyond.Only older colleaguescan remember the perils of railway journeys interrupted by a one hour stop at Goraghwood station, close to Newry, while all passengers were asked by customs officersthey had ‘anything to declare’. More affluent older travellers would more likely recall the cross-border queuing requirement for the predecessor of the ‘green card’ for cars. Today, the challenge is of how to deliver the political agreement that the border on this island should be either frictionless or non-existent as the UK plans to leave the EU. In the new era there will be redefined relations between NI and the Republic, within the framework of UK-EU relations. The important part lies in negotiations on working arrangements that have not yet officially started.For the remaining part of  and going into , the business scene might be described as getting ‘ready for le after Brexit’.In the last three years the business community which forms the core of the private sector in Northern Ireland has been trading successfully.  The evidence from local reviews of the larger profit making businesses has been encouraging. Year-on-year turnover has been increasing faster than inflation and, even more critically, profitability has been maintained and often improved.Work to identy how well locally owned and controlled businesses have performed has been reassuring. To be included in the review of the Top  more profitable Northern Ireland business, which will be published in more detail, the cut-off point has risen to just on £m annual pre-tax profits. In a further reassuring feature and in contrast to the preceding year, during the year  the number of business casualties fell to a very small number.While the overall performance of businesses in the private sector has been better than is sometimes appreciated, there is a mixture of features in the complex matrix of business performance. The evidence is often from personal subjective sources but the elements do point to a consistent pattern. Businesses have been trading, in general, with improved profits but with turnover rather less buoyant. Employment has been increasing, now more slowly, but pay rateshave not fully recovered from the fall in real earnings in the past decade. Interestingly at a regional and national level, changes in wage rates have not shown the boost of an inflationary increase that might have been expected when unemployment levels have fallen to near record lows.Bargaining in the labour market has been restrained, probably influenced by the siren voices of emerging problems as the Brexit withdrawal agreement has dominated the political and economic policy agenda. This points to the emergence of a contrast between the trend in overall business profitability, which has improved, alongside the trend for inidual personal incomes to lag behind the real levels of the past decade. To a modest degree, business profitability may have improved relative to changes in the costs of the payroll.While the scale of the dference should be treated with caution, as business evolves during the rest of , business finance may be better placed to activate improving investment plans.The post-Brexit business scene should be pointing to reduced uncertainty, even with some predictable new business obstacles, and a helpful change in government economic policy to incentivise faster economic expansion. That prospect, alongside a business sector that has a stronger capacity to invest and grow, makes the months ahead more encouraging than many experts expect.In summary, the business sector is understandably anxious to see aof greater business stability and, for a mixture of reasons, may now be more likely to implement more ambitious investment programmes. Add to this combination the possibility that official Government economic policy will be more flexibleand there is a hope that, out of the recent grey clouds of possible recession, there will be incentives leading to a more buoyant economy here.Just one moment of caution: the brightness of a new dawn in  may be dimmedthe political processes constrain the application of improved economic policies through a refreshed local administration. Business has been performing well, despite the huge levels of uncertainty. However, the political environment could drown out an improving economy. That challenge has not changed.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/graham_11.jpg","title":"word from the wise graham lapsley","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Graham Lapsley, head of private banking, Danske Bank How did you start out in business   Banking has always been in my blood as my father joined Belfast Banking Co Ltdin . As a boy I remember being in Northern Bank branches ‘helping out’ when my father was completing regular evenings doing overtime. This was an environment that I was familiar with, although I didn’t ever think I would make banking a career. In  I found myself in Limavady branch and thoroughly enjoyed branch banking at a time when there were no computers, no autobanks and lots of staff. I’ve benefited from lots of dferent roles at the Bank in my career, each bringing its own challenges. I left my role as head of personal credit last year to take up my current position as head of private banking. What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far On a personal level changing job roles always brought new challenges. Change is a constant which I accept and while I’ve worked in Danske Bank for  years I have had senior roles in branch banking, wealth management, business banking, risk management and now private banking.   As an area manager in branch banking, I found the leadership of the transition from Australian ownership to Danish ownership in  a huge challenge. This change was as exciting as it was challenging as we benefited from huge investment and the Dane’s leading edge technology. I didn’t go directly from school to university, but I’ve been lucky enough to have had employer support to complete a business studies degree and a masters’ degree in executive leadership. I’ve also attended business schools in Boston, Lausanne and London, with each giving me new tools to add into my skill set.  How would you describe your management style  I am energetic and enthusiastic. I love working with our relationship managers and customers to build a financial solution. I am very results oriented and prefer a direct style. I am very self-awareand have a positive outlook.  What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I’m not sure that I would change anything. I’ve learnt from my mistakes and that made me a better banker in the long term. Perhaps my ambition in my early career took me into roles that didn’t match my skill sets, but I did take away vital learnings from these experiences  Have you done it all on your own  Absolutely not. My we Sonya and family have always been a great support and this enabled me to have a good work le balance. I have a strong network personally and professionally, which is mutually supportive. I’ve also been lucky enough to have worked with many leaders who have greatly inspired me.  What’s more important, your product or your people  In Private Banking, without a doubt our people. We are a people business and our strength in Private Banking rests with the professionalism of the private banking team. We offer premium relationship management to our private banking customers, supported by leading edge digital solutions.

Danske is also the leading corporate and business bank in Northern Ireland, and many of these customers have their personal needs looked after by my private banking team.  What piece of advice would you give to a  year old you  You’ll never be judged on what happens to you, but you will be judged on how you react to it. And you won’t get the experience you need, until the day after you needed it.
